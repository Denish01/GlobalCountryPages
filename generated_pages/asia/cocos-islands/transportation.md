[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
The Cocos Islands are accessible by air, with the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Airport (CCK) being the main entry point. The airport is located on West Island and receives flights from Perth, Australia, which is the primary hub for direct flights to the Cocos Islands. There are no overland entry points, as the islands are located in the Indian Ocean, about 2,770 kilometers northwest of Perth. To get to the Cocos Islands, you typically need to fly to Perth and then take a connecting flight to the Cocos Islands.

The flight from Perth to the Cocos Islands takes around 4.5 hours, and there are limited flights per week. The primary airline operating flights to the Cocos Islands is Virgin Australia, although other airlines may offer charter flights or seasonal services. It's essential to book your flights well in advance, as the limited number of flights and seats can make it challenging to secure a spot, especially during peak travel seasons.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
There are no domestic flights within the Cocos Islands, as the territory consists of only two inhabited islands, West Island and Home Island, which are connected by a regular ferry service. However, you can take a ferry or a charter boat to travel between the islands. The ferry service operates several times a week and takes around 10-15 minutes to travel between West Island and Home Island. If you're looking to book a charter boat or a ferry, it's best to contact local operators or the Cocos Islands tourism board for more information and to make arrangements in advance.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
The Cocos Islands do not have a rail network, which means that trains are not an option for getting around the islands. The lack of a rail network is due to the small size of the territory and the limited population, making it unnecessary to develop a railway system. As a result, you'll need to rely on other modes of transportation, such as buses, cars, and ferries, to get around the islands.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
There are no commercial bus or coach services on the Cocos Islands, but you can use the local ferry service to travel between West Island and Home Island. Additionally, some resorts and hotels may offer shuttle services for their guests, which can be a convenient way to get around the islands. If you're planning to explore the islands, you may want to consider renting a car or bike, as this will give you more flexibility and freedom to create your own itinerary.
