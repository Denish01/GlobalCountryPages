[/SECTION]\nCocos Islands is a remote territory in the Indian Ocean with a high cost of living, primarily due to its isolation and reliance on imports from Australia. The cost of living in Cocos Islands is comparable to that of other remote islands in the region, such as Christmas Island, but is generally higher than in larger cities in Australia. The limited availability of goods and services, combined with the high cost of transportation, contributes to the expensive nature of living in or visiting Cocos Islands. Overall, Cocos Islands is an expensive destination, but its unique culture and stunning natural beauty make it an attractive option for travelers and expats willing to pay a premium for the experience.\n\nThe cost of living in Cocos Islands is also influenced by its small population and limited economic activity, which can drive up prices for essentials like food, housing, and transportation. However, the Australian government provides some subsidies and support to the territory, which helps to mitigate the high cost of living to some extent. Despite the challenges, Cocos Islands offers a unique and rewarding experience for those who are willing to adapt to its remote and expensive environment.\n\n[SECTION] Accommodation Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Price Range (USD/night) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Hostel/Budget | $80-150 | basic amenities, shared facilities |\n| Mid-Range Hotel | $200-350 | comfortable rooms, some amenities |\n| Luxury/Resort | $400-600 | high-end amenities, stunning views |\n| Apartment Rent (monthly) | $1,200-2,500 | city center vs outside, limited availability |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $10-20 |\n| Casual Restaurant | $20-40 |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $50-100 |\n| Fine Dining | $100-200 |\n| Beer (local) | $8-12 |\n| Coffee | $5-10 |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $3-5 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport | Cost (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Local bus/metro ride | $2-5 |\n| Taxi (per km) | $5-10 |\n| Domestic flight | $200-500 |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $1.50-2.50 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Breakdown [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Category | Budget ($) | Mid-Range ($) | Comfortable ($) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rent | 1,200 | 2,000 | 3,500 |\n| Food | 500 | 800 | 1,200 |\n| Transport | 100 | 200 | 500 |\n| Utilities | 150 | 250 | 400 |\n| Entertainment | 200 | 400 | 800 |\n| **Total** | **2,150** | **3,650** | **6,400** |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Money-Saving Tips [/SECTION]\n- Consider staying in budget accommodations or sharing an apartment with others to reduce housing costs.\n- Buy food and other essentials in bulk to take advantage of economies of scale.\n- Use public transportation or walk/bike whenever possible to reduce fuel costs.\n- Take advantage of free or low-cost activities like swimming, snorkeling, or exploring the island's natural beauty.\n- Cook your own meals instead of eating out to save on food costs.\n- Plan your trip during the off-season to take advantage of lower prices for accommodations and flights.",
