The quality of public transit is generally good, with most cities having a comprehensive network of buses and taxis. However, the traffic in major cities like Tehran can be chaotic, and the roads are often congested. Most people in Iran get around using taxis or ride-hailing services, which are affordable and widely available. The government has also invested in improving the public transportation system, with new metro lines and bus rapid transit systems being built in major cities.\n\nThe transportation system in Iran is also influenced by the country's geography, with the mountainous terrain in the north and the desert in the south posing challenges to transportation. However, the government has made efforts to improve the infrastructure, with new highways and roads being built to connect major cities. The transportation system in Iran is also affected by the economic sanctions, which have led to a shortage of spare parts and a increase in fuel prices.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.10-$0.20 | $10-$15 | Comprehensive coverage in major cities |\n| Metro / Subway | $0.20-$0.30 | $15-$20 | Available in Tehran, Mashhad, and Isfahan |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $0.20-$0.50 | N/A | Routes vary by city, but generally cover major areas |\n| Commuter Train | $1-$2 | $20-$30 | Available in Tehran and surrounding areas |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $1-$2 | $0.20-$0.30 | $2-$5 | Available in all major cities |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $1-$2 | $0.20-$0.30 | $2-$5 | Snapp and Tap30 are popular options |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $10-$20 | To city center, depending on traffic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $0.25-$0.35 | Prices vary depending on location and type of fuel |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $0.20-$0.30 | Prices vary depending on location and type of fuel |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $20-$50 | Economy car, prices vary depending on location and rental agency |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-$2 | Prices vary depending on location and time of day |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $2-$5 | Prices vary depending on route and distance |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $5-$10 | Prices vary depending on route and bus company |\n| Domestic Flight | $20-$50 | Typical route, prices vary depending on airline and time of booking |\n| Train (long-distance) | $10-$20 | Available on select routes, prices vary depending on class and route |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider using public buses or minibus/shared taxis, which are affordable and widely available.\n- Use ride-hailing apps like Snapp and Tap30 to get around, as they are convenient and affordable.\n- Be prepared to negotiate taxi fares, especially at airports or bus stations.\n- Consider purchasing a monthly transit pass for unlimited travel on public buses and metro lines.\n- Be aware of traffic rules and regulations, and always wear a seatbelt when driving or riding in a car.\n- Use reputable taxi companies or ride-hailing apps to ensure a safe and reliable ride.",
