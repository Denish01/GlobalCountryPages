[SECTION] Overview: Iran vs Pakistan [/SECTION]
Iran and Pakistan are two neighboring countries in Asia with distinct economic profiles. Iran has a more diversified economy, with a strong oil and gas sector, while Pakistan's economy is largely driven by textiles, agriculture, and remittances. The cost of living in Iran is generally higher due to its more developed infrastructure, higher labor costs, and stricter economic sanctions. In contrast, Pakistan has a lower cost of living, with more affordable housing, food, and transportation options. Overall, Pakistan is around 20-30% cheaper than Iran, making it a more attractive destination for budget-conscious travelers and expats.

The economic context of both countries also plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. Iran's economy has been affected by international sanctions, which have limited its access to foreign markets and investments. As a result, the country has experienced high inflation rates, which have driven up the cost of living. In contrast, Pakistan's economy has been more stable, with lower inflation rates and a growing middle class. This has contributed to a more affordable cost of living in Pakistan, with lower prices for housing, food, and other essential goods and services.
