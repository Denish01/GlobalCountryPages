Iran has a more diversified economy with a strong presence of industries such as oil and gas, automotive, and textiles, while Turkmenistan's economy is heavily reliant on its vast natural gas reserves. The cost of living in Iran is generally lower compared to Turkmenistan, with the former offering more affordable options for housing, food, and transportation. However, the economic sanctions imposed on Iran have led to a significant increase in inflation, which can affect the purchasing power of locals and expatriates alike.\n\nThe economic context of both countries plays a crucial role in determining the cost of living. Iran's economy has been facing challenges due to the sanctions, which have led to a decline in the value of the local currency, the Iranian Rial. On the other hand, Turkmenistan's economy has been growing steadily, driven by its natural gas exports. Despite these differences, Iran remains a more affordable option for those looking to live and work in the region. The cost of living in Iran is around 20-30% lower compared to Turkmenistan, making it an attractive destination for expatriates, students, and retirees.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Iran (USD) | Turkmenistan (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | $200 | $350 | 42% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | $150 | $250 | 40% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | $400 | $600 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Iran (USD) | Turkmenistan (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | $5 | $10 | 50% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | $100 | $150 | 33% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | $2 | $5 | 60% cheaper |\n| Coffee | $1 | $2 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Iran (USD) | Turkmenistan (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | $10 | $20 | 50% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | $0.50 | $1 | 50% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $0.50 | $0.70 | 29% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Iran (USD) | Turkmenistan (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | $50 | $70 | 29% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | $20 | $30 | 33% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | $10 | $15 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Iran (USD) | Turkmenistan (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | $500 | $700 | 29% |\n| Mid-Range | $1,000 | $1,400 | 29% |\n| Comfortable | $2,000 | $2,800 | 29% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Iran is cheaper for:**\n  - Rent and housing, with options available for 30-50% less than in Turkmenistan\n  - Food and dining, with meals and groceries available for 30-60% less than in Turkmenistan\n  - Transportation, with public transport and taxi fares available for 50% less than in Turkmenistan\n  - Utilities and internet, with options available for 20-30% less than in Turkmenistan\n- **Turkmenistan is cheaper for:**\n  - Certain imported goods, which may be subject to lower tariffs and taxes\n  - Luxury items, which may be available for lower prices due to the country's lower taxes\n  - Travel and tourism, with the country offering a range of affordable tour packages and travel options\n  - Certain business services, which may be available for lower prices due to the country's business-friendly environment\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nIran and Turkmenistan offer distinct advantages and disadvantages for different lifestyles.
