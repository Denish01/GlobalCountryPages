Iran has a largely state-controlled economy, while Turkey has a more diversified and open economy. In terms of cost of living, Iran is generally cheaper than Turkey, with lower prices for housing, food, and transportation. However, Turkey has a more developed tourism infrastructure and a wider range of consumer goods, which can drive up costs for expats and tourists.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries is also different, with Iran facing international sanctions and a more isolated economy, while Turkey is a member of the G20 and has a more integrated economy with Europe. Despite these differences, both countries offer a unique cultural and historical experience for visitors and expats, with a rich heritage and natural beauty. Iran's cost of living is around 20-30% lower than Turkey's, making it an attractive option for budget-conscious travelers and expats.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Iran (USD) | Turkey (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 200 | 350 | 43% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 150 | 250 | 40% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 400 | 600 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Iran (USD) | Turkey (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 5 | 10 | 50% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 100 | 150 | 33% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | 2 | 5 | 60% cheaper |\n| Coffee | 1 | 2 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Iran (USD) | Turkey (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 10 | 20 | 50% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | 0.5 | 1 | 50% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 0.5 | 1.5 | 67% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Iran (USD) | Turkey (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 50 | 100 | 50% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 20 | 30 | 33% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | 10 | 20 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Iran (USD) | Turkey (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 500 | 800 | 37% |\n| Mid-Range | 1,000 | 1,500 | 33% |\n| Comfortable | 2,000 | 3,000 | 33% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Iran is cheaper for:**\n  - Housing and rent, with prices 30-40% lower than in Turkey\n  - Food and dining, with meal prices 50% lower than in Turkey\n  - Transportation, with taxi and fuel prices 50-67% lower than in Turkey\n  - Utilities and internet, with prices 33-50% lower than in Turkey\n- **Turkey is cheaper for:**\n  - Certain consumer goods, such as electronics and clothing, which are more widely available and often cheaper in Turkey\n  - Tourist activities and attractions, which are more developed and diverse in Turkey\n  - Healthcare and medical services, which are more modern and widely available in Turkey\n  - International travel, with more flights and connections available from Turkish airports\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nIran offers better value for budget-conscious travelers and expats, with lower prices for housing, food, and transportation.
