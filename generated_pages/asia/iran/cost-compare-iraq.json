Iran has a more diversified economy, with a strong presence of industries such as oil and gas, automotive, and textiles, whereas Iraq's economy is heavily reliant on oil exports. In terms of cost of living, Iran is generally cheaper than Iraq, with lower prices for accommodation, food, and transportation. The economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living, with Iran's larger and more diversified economy contributing to its lower prices.\n\nThe cost of living in Iran is around 20-30% lower than in Iraq, making it an attractive destination for expats, students, and retirees looking for an affordable lifestyle. However, it's essential to note that prices can vary significantly depending on the location, with cities like Tehran and Isfahan tend to be more expensive than smaller towns and rural areas. In Iraq, the cost of living is higher, particularly in cities like Baghdad and Erbil, where the demand for accommodation and services is high due to the presence of international organizations and businesses.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Iran (USD) | Iraq (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 200 | 350 | 43% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 150 | 250 | 40% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 400 | 600 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Iran (USD) | Iraq (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 5 | 10 | 50% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 100 | 150 | 33% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | 2 | 5 | 60% cheaper |\n| Coffee | 1 | 2 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Iran (USD) | Iraq (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 10 | 20 | 50% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | 0.5 | 1 | 50% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 0.5 | 0.7 | 29% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Iran (USD) | Iraq (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 50 | 100 | 50% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 20 | 30 | 33% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | 10 | 20 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Iran (USD) | Iraq (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 400 | 600 | 33% |\n| Mid-Range | 800 | 1,200 | 33% |\n| Comfortable | 1,500 | 2,500 | 40% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Iran is cheaper for:**\n- Rent and housing, with prices up to 43% lower than in Iraq\n- Food and dining, with meals and groceries up to 50% cheaper\n- Transportation, with monthly transit passes and taxi fares up to 50% lower\n- Utilities and internet, with bills up to 50% cheaper\n- **Iraq is cheaper for:**\n- Certain electronic goods, which can be up to 20% cheaper due to lower import taxes\n- International flights, with more frequent and affordable connections to Europe and the Middle East\n- Hotel accommodation, with some luxury hotels offering competitive rates\n- Certain medical services, with some private hospitals and clinics offering high-quality care at lower prices\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nIran offers better value for expats, students, and retirees looking for an affordable lifestyle, with lower prices for accommodation, food, and transportation.
