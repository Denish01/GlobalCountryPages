[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Iran has a well-developed transportation network, with various modes of transport available, including buses, taxis, and ride-hailing services. The quality of public transit is generally good, with most cities having a comprehensive network of buses and taxis. However, the traffic in major cities like Tehran can be chaotic, and the roads are often congested. Most people in Iran get around using taxis or ride-hailing services, which are affordable and widely available. The government has also invested in improving the public transportation system, with new metro lines and bus rapid transit systems being built in major cities.

The transportation system in Iran is also influenced by the country's geography, with the mountainous terrain in the north and the desert in the south posing challenges to transportation. However, the government has made efforts to improve the infrastructure, with new highways and roads being built to connect major cities. The transportation system in Iran is also affected by the economic sanctions, which have led to a shortage of spare parts and a increase in fuel prices.
