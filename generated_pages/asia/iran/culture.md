# Iran Culture - Food, Traditions & Etiquette

[SECTION] Cultural Identity [/SECTION]
Iran's culture is a rich tapestry of ancient traditions, Islamic values, and modern influences. The country's unique cultural identity is shaped by its strategic location at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa, which has facilitated the exchange of ideas, customs, and values throughout history. The Persian language, also known as Farsi, is the primary language spoken in Iran and is an essential part of the country's cultural heritage. Iran is a multicultural society, with various ethnic groups, including Persians, Azerbaijanis, Kurds, and Turkmen, each contributing to the country's diverse cultural landscape.

Iran's cultural identity is deeply rooted in its Islamic heritage, with the majority of the population practicing Shia Islam. The country's Islamic Revolution in 1979 had a significant impact on Iranian culture, leading to the establishment of an Islamic republic and the implementation of Islamic laws and values. However, Iran's cultural identity is not limited to its Islamic heritage, as the country has a long and storied history of artistic, literary, and scientific achievements. The ancient Persian Empire, which dates back to the 6th century BCE, left a lasting legacy in the fields of architecture, engineering, and governance.

Iran's cultural identity is also influenced by its geographic location, with the country's diverse climate and geography supporting a wide range of cultural practices and traditions. From the snow-capped mountains of the north to the desert landscapes of the south, Iran's varied regions have given rise to distinct cultural practices, such as the nomadic traditions of the Qashqai people and the maritime culture of the coastal regions. Overall, Iran's cultural identity is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon, shaped by a rich history, diverse cultural influences, and a strong sense of national pride.

Iranian cuisine is known for its rich flavors, aromas, and variety of dishes. Mealtimes are often seen as opportunities to socialize and bond with family and friends. In Iran, it is customary to eat with your right hand, and to wait for the host to invite you to start eating. Food is often served in a communal setting, with multiple dishes placed in the center of the table for everyone to share.
