  "content": "Iran is generally more expensive than Pakistan, with a difference of around 20-30% in overall cost of living.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nIran GDP per Capita (PPP): 14,400\nPakistan GDP per Capita (PPP): 6,400\nIran Inflation Rate: 36.4%\nPakistan Inflation Rate: 10.9%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Pakistan\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Iran vs Pakistan [/SECTION]\nIran and Pakistan are two neighboring countries in Asia with distinct economic profiles. Iran has a more diversified economy, with a strong oil and gas sector, while Pakistan's economy is largely driven by textiles, agriculture, and remittances. The cost of living in Iran is generally higher due to its more developed infrastructure, higher labor costs, and stricter economic sanctions. In contrast, Pakistan has a lower cost of living, with more affordable housing, food, and transportation options. Overall, Pakistan is around 20-30% cheaper than Iran, making it a more attractive destination for budget-conscious travelers and expats.\n\nThe economic context of both countries also plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. Iran's economy has been affected by international sanctions, which have limited its access to foreign markets and investments. As a result, the country has experienced high inflation rates, which have driven up the cost of living. In contrast, Pakistan's economy has been more stable, with lower inflation rates and a growing middle class. This has contributed to a more affordable cost of living in Pakistan, with lower prices for housing, food, and other essential goods and services.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Iran (USD) | Pakistan (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 250 | 150 | 40% cheaper in Pakistan |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 180 | 100 | 44% cheaper in Pakistan |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 450 | 300 | 33% cheaper in Pakistan |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Iran (USD) | Pakistan (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 10 | 5 | 50% cheaper in Pakistan |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 300 | 200 | 33% cheaper in Pakistan |\n| Beer (500ml) | 5 | 3 | 40% cheaper in Pakistan |\n| Coffee | 2 | 1.5 | 25% cheaper in Pakistan |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Iran (USD) | Pakistan (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 20 | 10 | 50% cheaper in Pakistan |\n| Taxi (per km) | 0.5 | 0.3 | 40% cheaper in Pakistan |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 0.7 | 0.5 | 29% cheaper in Pakistan |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Iran (USD) | Pakistan (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 80 | 50 | 37% cheaper in Pakistan |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 20 | 15 | 25% cheaper in Pakistan |\n| Mobile Plan | 10 | 5 | 50% cheaper in Pakistan |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Iran (USD) | Pakistan (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 800 | 500 | 37% savings in Pakistan |\n| Mid-Range | 1,200 | 800 | 33% savings in Pakistan |\n| Comfortable | 2,000 | 1,200 | 40% savings in Pakistan |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Iran is cheaper for:**\n- High-end shopping and dining experiences\n- Luxury hotels and resorts\n- International flights and travel\n- High-quality healthcare services\n- **Pakistan is cheaper for:**\n- Budget-friendly accommodations and food\n- Local transportation and fuel\n- Mobile plans and internet services\n- Clothing and textiles\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nFor expats, students, and retirees, Pakistan offers a more affordable cost of living, with significant savings on housing, food, and transportation. However, Iran provides a more developed infrastructure, better healthcare services, and a wider range of international amenities, making it a better choice for those who value convenience and luxury. Families may find Pakistan a more attractive option due to its lower cost of living, while couples and solo travelers may prefer Iran's more vibrant cultural scene and entertainment options. Ultimately, the choice between Iran and Pakistan depends on individual priorities and lifestyle preferences.\n\nIn terms of overall value, Pakistan offers a better balance of affordability and quality of life, with a lower cost of living and a range of cultural and natural attractions. Iran, on the other hand, provides a more urbanized and modern experience, with a wider range of amenities and services. As both countries continue to develop and grow, they are likely to become increasingly attractive destinations for travelers and expats alike, each offering a unique blend of culture, history, and natural beauty.",
