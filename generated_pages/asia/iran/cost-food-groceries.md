[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Food prices in Iran are generally lower compared to the regional average, with a meal at an inexpensive restaurant costing around $3-5 USD. However, the high **inflation rate** of 32.5% in 2024 can drive up prices, making it essential to budget accordingly. The eating-out culture in Iran is not as prevalent as in other countries, with many locals preferring to cook at home. This is partly due to the fact that eating out can be relatively expensive, especially in mid-range and fine dining restaurants. On the other hand, home cooking allows individuals to take advantage of affordable ingredients and traditional recipes.

The cost of food in Iran is also influenced by the country's **geographical location**, with imports from neighboring countries such as Turkey and Iraq affecting prices. Additionally, the **seasonality** of produce can impact prices, with fresh fruits and vegetables being more expensive during the off-season. Despite these factors, Iran offers a unique and flavorful cuisine, with popular dishes such as **kebabs**, **stews**, and **rice dishes** being relatively affordable. With a **GDP per capita PPP** of $19,874 in 2024, Iranians have a relatively high purchasing power, allowing them to enjoy a variety of food options.

[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]
When it comes to shopping for groceries, Iranians have the option to choose between supermarkets and local markets.

However, the quality and variety of products can vary significantly depending on the market and the vendor.

For visitors, it's worth noting that local markets often require **bargaining**, which can be a fun and interactive experience. When shopping at local markets, it's essential to have a basic understanding of the local currency and to be prepared to haggle over prices.
