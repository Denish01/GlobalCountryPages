        <h2>Visa Policy Overview</h2>
        <p>Iran has a moderate visa policy, with a mix of visa-free access, visa on arrival, and required visas for different nationalities. Citizens of a few countries, such as Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, and Malaysia, can enter Iran visa-free for a limited period. However, most nationalities require a visa to enter the country. The Iranian government has been working to simplify the visa process and encourage tourism, but the requirements can still be complex and vary depending on the purpose of the visit.</p>
        <p>The Iranian visa policy is designed to balance the need to control the flow of visitors with the desire to promote tourism and cultural exchange. The government has introduced an electronic visa system, which allows citizens of many countries to apply for a visa online and receive it via email. This system has streamlined the process and made it easier for tourists to plan their trips to Iran. However, it is still important for travelers to understand the requirements and regulations before applying for a visa.</p>
        <h2>Requirements By Nationality</h2>
        <div class="table-wrapper"><table>

        <h2>By Visitor Type</h2>
        <tr><td><strong>Tourists:</strong> Tourists can typically stay in Iran for up to 30 days, and may be able to extend their stay for an additional 15 days. To apply for a tourist visa, travelers will need to provide proof of onward travel, as well as proof of sufficient funds. The cost of a tourist visa can vary depending on the nationality of the applicant and the type of visa required.</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Business Travelers:</strong> Business travelers will need to provide an invitation letter from an Iranian company, as well as proof of their business activities. They may also need to provide additional documentation, such as a letter from their employer or a copy of their business license. The requirements for business visas can be more complex than those for tourist visas, and may require more documentation and processing time.</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Students:</strong> Students will need to provide proof of enrollment at an Iranian university, as well as a letter from the university confirming their acceptance. They may also need to provide additional documentation, such as a copy of their passport and a proof of language proficiency. The duration of a student visa can vary depending on the length of the course of study.</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Workers:</strong> Workers will need to have a sponsorship from an Iranian employer, as well as a work permit. They may also need to provide additional documentation, such as a copy of their employment contract and a proof of qualifications. The process for obtaining a work visa can be complex and may require several months of processing time.</td></tr>
        <h2>Documents Checklist</h2>
        <tr><td>1. A valid passport with at least six months' validity</td></tr>
        <tr><td>2. A completed visa application form</td></tr>

        <h2>Entry Points & Procedures</h2>
        <tr><td>The main airports in Iran are Tehran Imam Khomeini International Airport and Tehran Mehrabad International Airport. Land borders are also open to neighboring countries, including Turkey, Iraq, and Afghanistan. When arriving in Iran, travelers will need to go through immigration and customs, where they will need to present their passport, visa, and other required documents. The immigration process can be slow, and travelers may be asked to provide additional information or answer questions about their trip.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Travelers should also be aware of the customs regulations in Iran, which prohibit the importation of certain items such as alcohol, pork products, and obscene materials. They should also declare any valuable items, such as jewelry or electronics, to avoid any issues when leaving the country. The customs process can be complex, and travelers may need to provide additional documentation or pay duties on certain items.</td></tr>
        <h2>Common Mistakes To Avoid</h2>
        <tr><td>- Not checking the expiration date of the passport before traveling</td></tr>
        <tr><td>- Not having the required documents, such as proof of onward travel or sufficient funds</td></tr>
        <tr><td>- Not applying for the correct type of visa</td></tr>
        <tr><td>- Not providing accurate information on the visa application form</td></tr>
        <tr><td>- Not declaring valuable items at customs</td></tr>
        <tr><td>- Not respecting Iranian customs and regulations, such as dress code and laws regarding photography</td></tr>
