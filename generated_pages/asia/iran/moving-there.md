# Moving to Iran — Visas, Residency & Expat Guide

To move to Iran, you will need to research and understand the country's unique cultural, economic, and bureaucratic landscape, and carefully plan your relocation by securing the appropriate visa, finding accommodation, and preparing for the challenges of expat life in a country with strict rules and regulations.

[SECTION] Why People Move to Iran [/SECTION]
Iran is a country with a rich history and culture, and many people are drawn to its unique blend of traditional and modern attractions. Expats are often surprised by the warm hospitality of the Iranian people, and the country's relatively low cost of living makes it an attractive destination for those looking to experience life in the Middle East. The most common reasons for moving to Iran include work opportunities, particularly in the oil and gas industry, as well as education and research opportunities at the country's prestigious universities. Additionally, some expats are drawn to Iran's vibrant cultural scene, which includes a thriving arts and music community.

The expat community in Iran is relatively small, but diverse, with people from all over the world living and working in the country. The majority of expats are men, and many are married with families, although there are also a significant number of single expats and digital nomads.
