However, the high **inflation rate** of 32.5% in 2024 can drive up prices, making it essential to budget accordingly. The eating-out culture in Iran is not as prevalent as in other countries, with many locals preferring to cook at home. This is partly due to the fact that eating out can be relatively expensive, especially in mid-range and fine dining restaurants. On the other hand, home cooking allows individuals to take advantage of affordable ingredients and traditional recipes.\n\nThe cost of food in Iran is also influenced by the country's **geographical location**, with imports from neighboring countries such as Turkey and Iraq affecting prices. Additionally, the **seasonality** of produce can impact prices, with fresh fruits and vegetables being more expensive during the off-season. Despite these factors, Iran offers a unique and flavorful cuisine, with popular dishes such as **kebabs**, **stews**, and **rice dishes** being relatively affordable. With a **GDP per capita PPP** of $19,874 in 2024, Iranians have a relatively high purchasing power, allowing them to enjoy a variety of food options.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $0.50-1.00 | 20,000-40,000 IRR | |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $0.20-0.50 | 8,000-20,000 IRR | |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $1.00-2.00 | 40,000-80,000 IRR | |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $0.50-1.50 | 20,000-60,000 IRR | |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $3.00-6.00 | 120,000-240,000 IRR | |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $5.00-10.00 | 200,000-400,000 IRR | |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $1.00-2.50 | 40,000-100,000 IRR | |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $0.50-1.50 | 20,000-60,000 IRR | |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $0.50-1.50 | 20,000-60,000 IRR | |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $0.20-0.50 | 8,000-20,000 IRR | |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $5.00-10.00 | 200,000-400,000 IRR | |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $0.50-1.00 | 20,000-40,000 IRR | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $2-5 | (typical dishes like kebabs and stews) |\n| Casual Restaurant | $5-10 | (one person, 2-3 courses) |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $15-30 | (3 courses, moderate prices) |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $30-50 | (upscale, 3-4 courses) |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $5-7 | |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $7-10 | |\n| Cappuccino | $2-5 | |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $1-3 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nWhen it comes to shopping for groceries, Iranians have the option to choose between supermarkets and local markets. While supermarkets offer a wider range of products and a more convenient shopping experience, local markets often provide fresher produce and more competitive prices. In general, prices at local markets are around 10-20% lower than those at supermarkets, making them a popular choice for many locals. However, the quality and variety of products can vary significantly depending on the market and the vendor.\n\nFor visitors, it's worth noting that local markets often require **bargaining**, which can be a fun and interactive experience. When shopping at local markets, it's essential to have a basic understanding of the local currency and to be prepared to haggle over prices. On the other hand, supermarkets offer a more straightforward shopping experience, with prices clearly marked and no need for bargaining. For staples like **rice**, **bread**, and **vegetables**, local markets are often the best option, while supermarkets may be a better choice for **imported goods** and **specialty items**.\n\n[SECTION] Local Food Tips [/SECTION]\n- For a cheap and delicious meal, try **street food** or **local eateries**, which offer a range of traditional dishes at affordable prices.\n- **Kebabs** are a staple in Iranian cuisine and can be found at most restaurants and street food stalls, with prices starting from around $2-3 USD.\n- **Fresh produce** is widely available and relatively affordable, with prices starting from around $0.50-1.00 USD per kilogram.\n- For a unique and flavorful experience, try **traditional Iranian desserts** like **baklava** or **sholezard**, which are often priced around $2-5 USD per serving.\n- When shopping for groceries, consider **buying in bulk** to save money, especially for staples like rice and bread.\n- **Avoid buying imported goods**, which can be expensive and may not be as fresh as local alternatives.",
