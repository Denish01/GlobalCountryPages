[/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nIran has a moderate visa policy, with a mix of visa-free access, visa on arrival, and required visas for different nationalities. Citizens of a few countries, such as Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, and Malaysia, can enter Iran visa-free for a limited period. However, most nationalities require a visa to enter the country. The Iranian government has been working to simplify the visa process and encourage tourism, but the requirements can still be complex and vary depending on the purpose of the visit.\n\nThe Iranian visa policy is designed to balance the need to control the flow of visitors with the desire to promote tourism and cultural exchange. The government has introduced an electronic visa system, which allows citizens of many countries to apply for a visa online and receive it via email. This system has streamlined the process and made it easier for tourists to plan their trips to Iran. However, it is still important for travelers to understand the requirements and regulations before applying for a visa.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | Yes | Special | 30 days | Requires a sponsor and approval from the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs |\n| UK Citizens | Yes | Tourist | 30 days | Can be obtained on arrival at certain airports |\n| EU Citizens | Yes | Tourist | 30 days | Can be obtained on arrival at certain airports, but some nationalities may require a visa in advance |\n| Canadian Citizens | Yes | Tourist | 30 days | Can be obtained on arrival at certain airports |\n| Australian Citizens | Yes | Tourist | 30 days | Can be obtained on arrival at certain airports |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | Tourist | 30 days | Requires a visa in advance, and may need to provide additional documentation |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Tourist | 30 days | Can be obtained on arrival at certain airports, but may require additional documentation |\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can typically stay in Iran for up to 30 days, and may be able to extend their stay for an additional 15 days.

When arriving in Iran, travelers will need to go through immigration and customs, where they will need to present their passport, visa, and other required documents. The immigration process can be slow, and travelers may be asked to provide additional information or answer questions about their trip.\n\nTravelers should also be aware of the customs regulations in Iran, which prohibit the importation of certain items such as alcohol, pork products, and obscene materials. They should also declare any valuable items, such as jewelry or electronics, to avoid any issues when leaving the country. The customs process can be complex, and travelers may need to provide additional documentation or pay duties on certain items.\n\n[SECTION] Common Mistakes To Avoid [/SECTION]\n- Not checking the expiration date of the passport before traveling\n- Not having the required documents, such as proof of onward travel or sufficient funds\n- Not applying for the correct type of visa\n- Not providing accurate information on the visa application form\n- Not declaring valuable items at customs\n- Not respecting Iranian customs and regulations, such as dress code and laws regarding photography",
