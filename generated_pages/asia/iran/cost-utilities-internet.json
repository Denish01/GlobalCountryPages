However, the cost of utilities can be fluctuating due to inflation and seasonal variation. The inflation rate in Iran is 32.5%, which can affect the prices of utilities, and the cost of electricity and gas can be higher during the winter months due to increased demand. Additionally, the government has implemented measures to reduce energy consumption and promote energy efficiency, which can impact utility costs.\n\nThe quality of utility infrastructure in Iran is generally good, with a high level of access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation. However, there can be variations in the quality of services depending on the location, with urban areas tend to have better infrastructure than rural areas. The government has also invested in renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, to reduce the country's dependence on fossil fuels and mitigate the impact of climate change.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $30 | $50 | $70 | |\n| Water | $10 | $15 | $20 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $5 | $5 | $5 | (included in municipal tax) |\n| **Total** | **$65** | **$100** | **$135** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $15-25 | 10-20 Mbps | Irancell, MCI |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $30-50 | 50-100 Mbps | Irancell, MCI |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $5-10 | 1-5 GB | Irancell, MCI |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $10-20 | 5-10 GB | Irancell, MCI |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $30-50 | varies | Irancell, MCI |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $5 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (e.g. Filimo) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Iran, you will typically need to provide identification and proof of address to the relevant authorities.\n- Prepaid electricity meters are common in Iran, and can help you manage your energy consumption and avoid unexpected bills.\n- Irancell and MCI are two of the major internet and phone providers in Iran, and offer a range of plans and services.\n- To save on utility bills, consider using energy-efficient appliances and turning off lights and electronics when not in use.\n- Be aware of seasonal variation in utility costs, and plan your budget accordingly to avoid unexpected expenses.",
