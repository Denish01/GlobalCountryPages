The rental market is relatively competitive, with typical lease terms ranging from 6-12 months, and deposit requirements usually equivalent to 1-2 months' rent. Tenant rights are generally protected by law, with the landlord responsible for maintenance and repairs. However, the high inflation rate of 32.5% can make it challenging for renters to afford increases in rent. Compared to regional neighbors, Iran's housing costs are relatively moderate, with countries like Turkey and Azerbaijan having higher prices, while Afghanistan and Pakistan have lower prices.\n\nThe Iranian government has implemented various policies to control housing prices and make them more affordable for citizens. For example, the government has introduced subsidies for first-time homebuyers and implemented rent control measures in some areas. However, the high demand for housing, particularly in urban areas, continues to drive up prices. Additionally, the country's economic sanctions have limited the availability of foreign investment in the housing sector, which has further constrained the supply of affordable housing.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $150-$300 | $100-$200 | small, basic apartments |\n| 1 Bedroom | $200-$400 | $150-$300 | typical quality, 1 bathroom |\n| 2 Bedroom | $300-$600 | $250-$500 | family size, 2 bathrooms |\n| 3 Bedroom | $500-$1,000 | $400-$800 | spacious, 2-3 bathrooms |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $1,500-$3,000 | prime locations, modern apartments |\n| Suburbs | $1,000-$2,000 | residential areas, older buildings |\n| Rural | $500-$1,000 | limited amenities, traditional houses |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Vanak**: a popular neighborhood in north Tehran, with modern apartments and amenities, rent range $300-$600 USD per month\n- **Elahieh**: an upscale neighborhood in north Tehran, with luxurious apartments and villas, rent range $500-$1,200 USD per month\n- **Karimkhan**: a central neighborhood in Tehran, with a mix of old and new buildings, rent range $200-$400 USD per month\n- **Saadat Abad**: a residential neighborhood in west Tehran, with modern apartments and amenities, rent range $250-$500 USD per month\n- **Pasdaran**: a neighborhood in east Tehran, with a mix of old and new buildings, rent range $150-$300 USD per month\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Iran [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods thoroughly to find the best area for your needs and budget\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent to find apartments and negotiate prices\n- Be prepared to pay a deposit and first month's rent upfront\n- Utilities such as electricity, water, and gas are usually not included in the rent\n- Furnished apartments are less common than unfurnished ones, but can be found in some neighborhoods\n- Be cautious of scams and ensure that you sign a legitimate lease agreement before moving in\n- Consider learning some basic **Persian** phrases to communicate with landlords and neighbors\n- Be aware of the **inflation rate** and how it may affect your rent and living expenses\n- Research the **local customs** and traditions to avoid any unintended offense or misunderstandings",
