Iran's history began with the rise of the **Elamite civilization** in the 3rd millennium BCE, followed by the **Median Empire** in the 7th century BCE. The **Achaemenid Empire**, founded by **Cyrus the Great** in 550 BCE, was one of the largest empires of the ancient world, stretching from the Indus River to the Mediterranean Sea. The Achaemenid Empire was conquered by **Alexander the Great** in the 4th century BCE, and later became part of the **Sassanid Empire**, which was a major power in the region until the 7th century CE. The **Arab conquest** of Iran in the 7th century CE introduced **Islam** to the region, and the country became a major center of Islamic learning and culture. In the 13th century CE, Iran was invaded by the **Mongols**, who destroyed many cities and towns, but also introduced **Buddhism** and **Tibetan culture** to the region.

The **Safavid dynasty**, which ruled Iran from the 16th to the 18th century CE, is considered one of the most important periods in Iranian history.
