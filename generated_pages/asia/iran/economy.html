        <h2>Economic Overview</h2>
        <p>Iran has a diverse economy with a mix of state-owned and private enterprises. The country is classified as an upper-middle-income economy, with a relatively high GDP per capita compared to other countries in the region. Iran's economy has been driven primarily by its large oil and natural gas reserves, which have been the main source of revenue for the government. However, in recent years, the country has been working to diversify its economy and reduce its dependence on oil exports. The government has implemented various policies to promote private sector growth, increase foreign investment, and develop non-oil sectors such as manufacturing, agriculture, and services.</p>
        <p>Iran's economic development has been hindered by various challenges, including international sanctions, corruption, and a lack of transparency. The country has also faced significant economic fluctuations, including high inflation rates and a devalued currency. Despite these challenges, Iran has made significant progress in recent years, with the economy experiencing moderate growth and a decline in inflation rates. The government has also implemented various reforms, including the establishment of a new tax system and the privatization of state-owned enterprises.</p>
        <p>Iran's economic trajectory is expected to continue to be driven by its large oil and natural gas reserves, as well as its strategic location at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. The country is also working to develop its non-oil sectors, including manufacturing, agriculture, and services, and to increase its foreign investment. However, the country's economic growth is likely to be impacted by various external factors, including global oil prices, international sanctions, and regional geopolitical tensions.</p>
