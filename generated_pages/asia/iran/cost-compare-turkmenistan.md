[SECTION] Overview: Iran vs Turkmenistan [/SECTION]
Iran and Turkmenistan are two neighboring countries in Asia with distinct economic contexts. Iran has a more diversified economy with a strong presence of industries such as oil and gas, automotive, and textiles, while Turkmenistan's economy is heavily reliant on its vast natural gas reserves. The cost of living in Iran is generally lower compared to Turkmenistan, with the former offering more affordable options for housing, food, and transportation. However, the economic sanctions imposed on Iran have led to a significant increase in inflation, which can affect the purchasing power of locals and expatriates alike.

The economic context of both countries plays a crucial role in determining the cost of living. Iran's economy has been facing challenges due to the sanctions, which have led to a decline in the value of the local currency, the Iranian Rial. On the other hand, Turkmenistan's economy has been growing steadily, driven by its natural gas exports. Despite these differences, Iran remains a more affordable option for those looking to live and work in the region. The cost of living in Iran is around 20-30% lower compared to Turkmenistan, making it an attractive destination for expatriates, students, and retirees.
