[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The Iranian government is based on the principles of the **Islamic Revolution**, which overthrew the monarchy in 1979. The system is designed to ensure the dominance of **Shia Islam** and the authority of the Supreme Leader, who is responsible for appointing key officials and has veto power over the President and the legislature. The government is divided into three branches: the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial, with a complex system of checks and balances. The **Constitution** of Iran, adopted in 1979, outlines the framework of the government and the relationship between the branches.

The **separation of powers** in Iran is not as clear-cut as in other countries, with the Supreme Leader holding significant influence over all branches of government. The **unitary** system of government means that power is concentrated in the central government, with limited autonomy for regional authorities. The government has implemented various **reforms** over the years, including the establishment of an **Expediency Council** to resolve disputes between the legislature and the Guardian Council.

The **political culture** in Iran is characterized by a complex interplay between **conservative** and **reformist** factions, with the former generally aligned with the Supreme Leader and the latter pushing for greater **liberalization** and **democratization**. The government has faced numerous **challenges**, including economic stagnation, corruption, and human rights concerns, which have led to periodic **protests** and **unrest**.
