The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality, with longer wait times and less advanced medical equipment, but it is also significantly cheaper. Locals often use the public system for routine medical care, while foreigners and those who can afford it may opt for private healthcare. The private healthcare system in Iran is generally of higher quality, with shorter wait times and more advanced medical equipment, but it is also more expensive. Whether you are a local or a foreigner, having health insurance is highly recommended, as it can help cover the cost of medical care and ensure that you receive timely and quality treatment.\n\nThe healthcare system in Iran is generally well-organized, with a network of hospitals, clinics, and medical centers throughout the country. However, the quality of care can vary significantly depending on the location and type of facility. In major cities like Tehran, there are many high-quality private hospitals and medical centers that offer advanced medical care, while in rural areas, medical facilities may be more limited. Additionally, some medical specialties, such as cancer treatment and organ transplants, may only be available in major cities.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $10-$20 | $30-$50 | |\n| Specialist Consultation | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | |\n| Dental Checkup | $20-$30 | $50-$70 | |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$20 | $30-$50 | |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $20-$30 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$100 | |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $100-$200 | |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$1,000 | |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,000-$2,000 | |\n| MRI Scan | $100-$200 | |\n| X-Ray | $20-$50 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Routine medical care, hospital stays, and basic procedures |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-$200 | Advanced medical care, specialist consultations, and major procedures |\n| International / Expat | $200-$500 | Global coverage, including medical evacuation and repatriation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medications are generally affordable, with prices starting from $5-$10 per month.\n- Over-the-counter medications are widely available and relatively cheap, with prices starting from $2-$5 per unit.\n- Many pharmacies are open 24/7, especially in major cities.\n- Some medications may require a prescription from a licensed doctor.\n- Prices for medications can vary depending on the brand and type.\n- It is recommended to always check the expiration date and packaging of medications before purchasing.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the local emergency number, 115, or seek immediate attention at the nearest hospital. Ambulance services are available, but may not always be reliable, especially in rural areas. For foreigners, it is recommended to seek medical attention at one of the many private hospitals in major cities, such as Tehran, which offer high-quality care and have English-speaking staff. Some of the best hospitals for foreigners in Iran include the **Tehran University of Medical Sciences** and the **Iranmehr Hospital**, which offer a range of medical services, including emergency care, surgery, and specialist consultations.\n\nIn a medical emergency, it is crucial to remain calm and seek help as quickly as possible. If you are in a remote area, it may be necessary to travel to the nearest city or town to receive medical attention. It is also a good idea to have a basic first aid kit with you, which should include essentials such as bandages, antiseptic wipes, and painkillers. Additionally, it is recommended to learn some basic **Persian phrases**, such as \"komak\" (help) and \"bimaristan\" (hospital), which can help you communicate with locals in an emergency situation.",
