[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The Iranian property market has experienced significant fluctuations in recent years, driven by factors such as economic sanctions, currency fluctuations, and government policies. The market is currently characterized by a surplus of supply, particularly in the luxury segment, which has led to a decline in prices. However, the demand for affordable housing remains high, and the government has implemented various initiatives to support the development of this sector. The price trajectory of the market is expected to remain stable in the short term, with potential for growth in the long term.

The urban property market in Iran is more developed than the rural market, with major cities such as Tehran, Isfahan, and Shiraz offering a wide range of properties, from apartments to villas. The rural market, on the other hand, is less developed, but it offers opportunities for investment in agricultural land and tourism-related projects. The government has launched several initiatives to support the development of the rural market, including the provision of subsidies and incentives for investors.

Despite the challenges facing the market, Iran's property sector offers attractive opportunities for investors, particularly those who are willing to take a long-term view. The country's strategic location, rich natural resources, and large population make it an attractive destination for foreign investment. However, investors need to be aware of the risks and challenges associated with investing in the Iranian property market, including the complex regulatory environment and the potential for currency fluctuations.
