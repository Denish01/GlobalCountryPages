  "content": "Healthcare in Iran is a mixed system that combines public and private providers, offering a wide range of medical services to its citizens and visitors, with a generally good quality of care, especially in urban areas.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nQuality Rating: Good\nEmergency Number: 115\nHospital Standard: Good\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: widespread\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nIran's healthcare system is a mixed model, with both public and private providers playing a significant role. The public sector is responsible for providing primary healthcare services, including preventive care, maternal and child health, and infectious disease control. The private sector, on the other hand, offers specialized and tertiary care services, including hospitalization, surgery, and advanced diagnostic testing. The quality of care in Iran is generally good, with many well-equipped hospitals and skilled healthcare professionals, especially in urban areas such as Tehran. However, there are significant disparities in healthcare access and quality between urban and rural areas, with rural areas often lacking adequate healthcare facilities and personnel.\n\nThe Iranian government has made significant efforts to improve the healthcare system, including increasing healthcare funding, expanding health insurance coverage, and implementing health sector reforms. As a result, Iran has made significant progress in reducing infant and maternal mortality rates, increasing life expectancy, and improving overall health outcomes. Despite these achievements, the healthcare system in Iran still faces challenges, including a shortage of specialized healthcare professionals, inadequate healthcare infrastructure, and limited access to healthcare services in rural areas.\n\nThe healthcare system in Iran is also influenced by the country's cultural and social context. For example, the concept of **family-centered care** is highly valued in Iranian culture, with family members often playing a significant role in caring for their loved ones. Additionally, the **Islamic healthcare** approach, which emphasizes the importance of spiritual and emotional well-being, is also an important aspect of the healthcare system in Iran.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Tehran University of Medical Sciences | Tehran | Public | General medicine, surgery, pediatrics | Yes |\n| Shiraz University of Medical Sciences | Shiraz | Public | General medicine, surgery, cardiology | Yes |\n| Milad Hospital | Tehran | Private | General medicine, surgery, oncology | Yes |\n| Pars Hospital | Tehran | Private | General medicine, surgery, orthopedics | Yes |\n| Imam Khomeini Hospital | Tehran | Public | General medicine, surgery, trauma | Limited |\n| Khatam-Al-Anbia Hospital | Tehran | Private | General medicine, surgery, neurology | Yes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Social health insurance** is available to all citizens, and it covers a wide range of healthcare services, including hospitalization, surgery, and outpatient care.\n- **Private health insurance** is also available, and it offers additional benefits, such as coverage for specialized care, dental care, and vision care.\n- **Expats** and foreigners are recommended to purchase private health insurance, as they are not eligible for social health insurance.\n- The cost of health insurance in Iran varies depending on the type of insurance, age, and health status, but it is generally affordable, with premiums ranging from $100 to $500 per year.\n- **Travel insurance** is also recommended for tourists and visitors, as it provides coverage for emergency medical care, evacuation, and repatriation.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Prescription medications** are widely available in Iran, and they can be purchased at pharmacies with a valid prescription.\n- **Over-the-counter medications** are also available, and they can be purchased without a prescription.\n- **Common brands** of medications, such as **Aspirin** and **Ibuprofen**, are widely available in Iran.\n- **Generic medications** are also available, and they are generally cheaper than brand-name medications.\n- **Pharmacies** are widespread in urban areas, but they may be limited in rural areas, where **traditional medicine** is often more common.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Hepatitis A** and **Typhoid** vaccinations are recommended for all travelers to Iran.\n- **Hepatitis B** and **Rabies** vaccinations are also recommended for certain travelers, such as healthcare workers and adventure travelers.\n- **Malaria** is a risk in some areas of Iran, particularly in the southeastern provinces.\n- **Waterborne diseases**, such as **Cholera** and **Diarrhea**, are also a risk in Iran, particularly in areas with poor sanitation.\n- **Foodborne diseases**, such as **Salmonella** and **E. coli**, are also a risk in Iran, particularly in areas with poor food handling practices.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **Medical tourism** is a growing industry in Iran, with many patients traveling to the country for **cosmetic surgery**, **dental care**, and **fertility treatment**.\n- **Accredited hospitals**, such as the **Tehran University of Medical Sciences**, offer high-quality medical care to international patients.\n- **Cost savings** are a significant advantage of medical tourism in Iran, with many procedures costing 50-70% less than in Western countries.\n- **Language support** is also available, with many hospitals and clinics offering English-speaking staff and interpreters.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- In case of an **emergency**, call the **emergency number** 115, which is available 24/7.\n- **Ambulance services** are available in urban areas, but they may be limited in rural areas.\n- **Nearest hospitals** can be found by asking locals or using a mapping app.\n- **Insurance claims** can be submitted to the insurance company, and they will reimburse the costs of emergency medical care.\n- **Medical evacuation** may be necessary in some cases, and it can be arranged through the insurance company or a medical evacuation service.",
