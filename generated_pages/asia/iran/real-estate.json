The market is currently characterized by a surplus of supply, particularly in the luxury segment, which has led to a decline in prices.

The price trajectory of the market is expected to remain stable in the short term, with potential for growth in the long term.\n\nThe urban property market in Iran is more developed than the rural market, with major cities such as Tehran, Isfahan, and Shiraz offering a wide range of properties, from apartments to villas. The rural market, on the other hand, is less developed, but it offers opportunities for investment in agricultural land and tourism-related projects.

The country's strategic location, rich natural resources, and large population make it an attractive destination for foreign investment.
