[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]
The linguistic landscape of Iran is diverse, with **Persian** being the dominant language spoken by over 50 million people. There are several regional dialects, including Tehrani, Isfahani, and Shirazi, which may differ slightly in pronunciation and vocabulary. Additionally, there are several minority languages spoken in Iran, including **Azerbaijani**, **Kurdish**, and **Arabic**, which are spoken by significant populations in various regions. English is not widely understood, particularly among older generations, and visitors may find it challenging to communicate with locals who do not speak English. However, many younger Iranians and those in the tourism industry may have a basic understanding of English.

In urban areas, such as Tehran and Isfahan, English may be more widely understood, particularly in hotels, restaurants, and shops catering to tourists. However, in rural areas and smaller towns, English is less common, and visitors may need to rely on **Persian** or other local languages to communicate. It is essential for visitors to learn basic **Persian** phrases to navigate everyday situations and interact with locals.

Despite the language barrier, Iranians are known for their hospitality and welcoming nature, and visitors can expect to receive warm and friendly treatment. Many Iranians are eager to practice their English skills and engage with foreigners, making it easier for visitors to communicate and build connections.
