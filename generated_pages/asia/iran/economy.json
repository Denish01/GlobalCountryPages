The country is classified as an upper-middle-income economy, with a relatively high GDP per capita compared to other countries in the region. Iran's economy has been driven primarily by its large oil and natural gas reserves, which have been the main source of revenue for the government. However, in recent years, the country has been working to diversify its economy and reduce its dependence on oil exports. The government has implemented various policies to promote private sector growth, increase foreign investment, and develop non-oil sectors such as manufacturing, agriculture, and services.\n\nIran's economic development has been hindered by various challenges, including international sanctions, corruption, and a lack of transparency. The country has also faced significant economic fluctuations, including high inflation rates and a devalued currency. Despite these challenges, Iran has made significant progress in recent years, with the economy experiencing moderate growth and a decline in inflation rates. The government has also implemented various reforms, including the establishment of a new tax system and the privatization of state-owned enterprises.\n\nIran's economic trajectory is expected to continue to be driven by its large oil and natural gas reserves, as well as its strategic location at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. The country is also working to develop its non-oil sectors, including manufacturing, agriculture, and services, and to increase its foreign investment. However, the country's economic growth is likely to be impacted by various external factors, including global oil prices, international sanctions, and regional geopolitical tensions.\n\n[SECTION] Key Industries [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Industry | Contribution | Details |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Petroleum | 20% of GDP | Iran is the second-largest oil producer in the Middle East and has the fourth-largest oil reserves in the world |\n| Natural Gas | 15% of GDP | Iran has the second-largest natural gas reserves in the world and is a significant producer of natural gas |\n| Textiles | 5% of GDP | Iran has a well-established textile industry, with a focus on producing high-quality carpets, clothing, and other textile products |\n| Agriculture | 10% of GDP | Iran is a significant producer of agricultural products, including wheat, rice, and fruits, and has a growing agricultural sector |\n| Manufacturing | 20% of GDP | Iran has a diverse manufacturing sector, with a focus on producing goods such as automobiles, electronics, and food products |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Trade Profile [/SECTION]\n**Top Exports:** \n- **Petroleum products**: Iran is a significant exporter of petroleum products, including crude oil, natural gas, and refined petroleum products\n- **Natural gas**: Iran exports natural gas to several countries, including Turkey and Armenia\n- **Textiles**: Iran exports a significant amount of textiles, including carpets, clothing, and other textile products\n- **Fruits and nuts**: Iran is a significant producer of fruits and nuts, including pistachios, almonds, and dried fruits\n- **Handicrafts**: Iran is known for its high-quality handicrafts, including carpets, pottery, and metalwork\n\n**Top Imports:** \n- **Machinery**: Iran imports a significant amount of machinery, including industrial equipment and automotive parts\n- **Electronics**: Iran imports a range of electronic products, including computers, smartphones, and televisions\n- **Food products**: Iran imports a significant amount of food products, including wheat, rice, and sugar\n- **Chemicals**: Iran imports a range of chemicals, including fertilizers and plastics\n- **Pharmaceuticals**: Iran imports a significant amount of pharmaceutical products, including medicines and medical equipment\n\n**Key Trading Partners:** \n- China: Iran's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade valued at over $20 billion\n- United Arab Emirates: A significant trading partner, with bilateral trade valued at over $10 billion\n- Turkey: A key trading partner, with bilateral trade valued at over $5 billion\n- Iraq: A significant trading partner, with bilateral trade valued at over $4 billion\n- South Korea: A key trading partner, with bilateral trade valued at over $3 billion\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n- Iran has a well-developed transport network, including over 200,000 kilometers of roads and a significant rail network\n- The country has a number of major ports, including the Port of Bandar Abbas and the Port of Bushehr, which handle a significant amount of trade\n- Iran has a relatively high level of internet and mobile penetration, with over 60% of the population having access to the internet\n- The country has a number of major airports, including Tehran's Imam Khomeini International Airport and Mashhad's Shahid Hashemi Nejad International Airport\n- Iran has a significant energy sector, with a focus on developing its oil and natural gas reserves, as well as its renewable energy sector\n\n[SECTION] Economic Outlook [/SECTION]\nIran's economic outlook is expected to be driven by its large oil and natural gas reserves, as well as its strategic location at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.
