[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Iran's healthcare system is a mixed model, with both public and private providers playing a significant role. The public sector is responsible for providing primary healthcare services, including preventive care, maternal and child health, and infectious disease control. The private sector, on the other hand, offers specialized and tertiary care services, including hospitalization, surgery, and advanced diagnostic testing. The quality of care in Iran is generally good, with many well-equipped hospitals and skilled healthcare professionals, especially in urban areas such as Tehran. However, there are significant disparities in healthcare access and quality between urban and rural areas, with rural areas often lacking adequate healthcare facilities and personnel.

The Iranian government has made significant efforts to improve the healthcare system, including increasing healthcare funding, expanding health insurance coverage, and implementing health sector reforms. As a result, Iran has made significant progress in reducing infant and maternal mortality rates, increasing life expectancy, and improving overall health outcomes. Despite these achievements, the healthcare system in Iran still faces challenges, including a shortage of specialized healthcare professionals, inadequate healthcare infrastructure, and limited access to healthcare services in rural areas.

The healthcare system in Iran is also influenced by the country's cultural and social context. For example, the concept of **family-centered care** is highly valued in Iranian culture, with family members often playing a significant role in caring for their loved ones. Additionally, the **Islamic healthcare** approach, which emphasizes the importance of spiritual and emotional well-being, is also an important aspect of the healthcare system in Iran.
