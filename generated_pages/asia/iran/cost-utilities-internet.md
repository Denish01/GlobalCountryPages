[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Iran's utility infrastructure is relatively well-developed, with a high percentage of households having access to electricity, water, and gas. However, the cost of utilities can be fluctuating due to inflation and seasonal variation. The inflation rate in Iran is 32.5%, which can affect the prices of utilities, and the cost of electricity and gas can be higher during the winter months due to increased demand. Additionally, the government has implemented measures to reduce energy consumption and promote energy efficiency, which can impact utility costs.

The quality of utility infrastructure in Iran is generally good, with a high level of access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation. However, there can be variations in the quality of services depending on the location, with urban areas tend to have better infrastructure than rural areas. The government has also invested in renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, to reduce the country's dependence on fossil fuels and mitigate the impact of climate change.
