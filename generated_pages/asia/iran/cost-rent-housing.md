[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Iran's housing market is characterized by a mix of modern and traditional apartments, with a strong demand for housing in major cities like Tehran. The rental market is relatively competitive, with typical lease terms ranging from 6-12 months, and deposit requirements usually equivalent to 1-2 months' rent. Tenant rights are generally protected by law, with the landlord responsible for maintenance and repairs. However, the high inflation rate of 32.5% can make it challenging for renters to afford increases in rent. Compared to regional neighbors, Iran's housing costs are relatively moderate, with countries like Turkey and Azerbaijan having higher prices, while Afghanistan and Pakistan have lower prices.

The Iranian government has implemented various policies to control housing prices and make them more affordable for citizens. For example, the government has introduced subsidies for first-time homebuyers and implemented rent control measures in some areas. However, the high demand for housing, particularly in urban areas, continues to drive up prices. Additionally, the country's economic sanctions have limited the availability of foreign investment in the housing sector, which has further constrained the supply of affordable housing.
