[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in Iran is generally of moderate quality, with an average speed of 10 Mbps download, which can be sufficient for basic browsing, email, and social media. However, the quality of the internet can vary greatly depending on the location, with urban areas like Tehran, Isfahan, and Shiraz tend to have better connectivity than rural areas. The internet infrastructure in Iran is still developing, and the government has implemented various restrictions and censorship on online content, which can affect the reliability of the internet.

The urban-rural divide in internet accessibility is significant in Iran, with many rural areas lacking access to reliable and high-speed internet. This can make it challenging for people living in these areas to access online services, communicate with others, and access information. Despite these challenges, the Iranian government has been investing in the development of the country's internet infrastructure, including the expansion of fiber-optic networks and the introduction of 5G services in major cities.

[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]
To get a SIM card in Iran, tourists can visit one of the many mobile operator stores or authorized resellers, such as MCI, MTN Irancell, or Rightel, and purchase a prepaid SIM card.
