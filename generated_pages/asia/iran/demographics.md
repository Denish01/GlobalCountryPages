[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
The population of Iran is significant, with the country ranking as one of the most populous in the Middle East. With a growth rate of 1.2%, the population is expected to continue to increase, albeit at a slower rate than in previous decades. Urbanization is a dominant trend in Iran, with approximately 74% of the population residing in urban areas. This trend is driven by economic opportunities, improved access to education and healthcare, and a higher standard of living. Migration patterns in Iran are also noteworthy, with many citizens relocating from rural areas to cities in search of better job prospects and living conditions.

The population size of Iran is also significant in the context of the country's economy, with a large and relatively young workforce. The median age of 32 years indicates that the population is still relatively young, with a significant proportion of working-age individuals. However, the population is also aging, with implications for the country's pension system, healthcare, and social security. The government has implemented policies to address these challenges, including measures to increase the retirement age and encourage private sector investment in healthcare.

Iran's population growth has also been influenced by government policies, including family planning initiatives and economic development programs. The government has implemented programs to reduce poverty and improve access to education and healthcare, which have contributed to a decline in fertility rates and an increase in life expectancy. However, the country still faces challenges related to population growth, including pressure on infrastructure, resources, and the environment.
