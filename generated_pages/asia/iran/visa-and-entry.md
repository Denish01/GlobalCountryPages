# Iran Visa & Entry Requirements

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Iran before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Iran has a moderate visa policy, with a mix of visa-free access, visa on arrival, and required visas for different nationalities. Citizens of a few countries, such as Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, and Malaysia, can enter Iran visa-free for a limited period. However, most nationalities require a visa to enter the country. The Iranian government has been working to simplify the visa process and encourage tourism, but the requirements can still be complex and vary depending on the purpose of the visit.

The Iranian visa policy is designed to balance the need to control the flow of visitors with the desire to promote tourism and cultural exchange. The government has introduced an electronic visa system, which allows citizens of many countries to apply for a visa online and receive it via email. This system has streamlined the process and made it easier for tourists to plan their trips to Iran. However, it is still important for travelers to understand the requirements and regulations before applying for a visa.

**Workers:** Workers will need to have a sponsorship from an Iranian employer, as well as a work permit.

[SECTION] Entry Points & Procedures [/SECTION]
The main airports in Iran are Tehran Imam Khomeini International Airport and Tehran Mehrabad International Airport.

When arriving in Iran, travelers will need to go through immigration and customs, where they will need to present their passport, visa, and other required documents. The immigration process can be slow, and travelers may be asked to provide additional information or answer questions about their trip.

Travelers should also be aware of the customs regulations in Iran, which prohibit the importation of certain items such as alcohol, pork products, and obscene materials. They should also declare any valuable items, such as jewelry or electronics, to avoid any issues when leaving the country. The customs process can be complex, and travelers may need to provide additional documentation or pay duties on certain items.
