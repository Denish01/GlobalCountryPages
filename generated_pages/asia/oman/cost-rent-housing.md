[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Oman's rental market is relatively stable, with a steady demand for apartments and villas in the major cities, particularly in Muscat. Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, with a deposit requirement of one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected under Omani law, which requires landlords to provide a written contract and maintain the property in good condition. Compared to its regional neighbors, Oman's housing costs are generally higher than those in Saudi Arabia and Yemen, but lower than those in the UAE.

The Omani government has implemented various initiatives to regulate the housing market and provide affordable housing options for citizens and expatriates. These initiatives include the development of new residential areas and the introduction of rent control measures to prevent excessive price increases. However, the demand for housing in Oman remains high, particularly in the capital city, which can drive up prices and make it challenging for renters to find affordable options.
