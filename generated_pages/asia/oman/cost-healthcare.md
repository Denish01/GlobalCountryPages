[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Oman has a mixed healthcare system, consisting of both public and private healthcare providers. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of high quality and is available to all citizens, with foreigners often opting for private healthcare services. The public healthcare system is funded by the government, with patients required to pay a small fee for services. Private healthcare services, on the other hand, are more expensive but often offer more specialized care and shorter waiting times. Locals typically have access to public healthcare services, while foreigners often prefer private healthcare services, especially those with health insurance.

The healthcare system in Oman is well-regulated, with both public and private healthcare providers required to meet certain standards. However, the quality of care can vary significantly depending on the provider and the location. In general, healthcare services in Muscat, the capital city, are considered to be of higher quality than those in other parts of the country. It is recommended that foreigners have health insurance to cover any medical expenses, as the cost of healthcare in Oman can be high, especially for private services.
