[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Oman has a **desert climate**, with very little rainfall throughout the year. The country can be divided into two main climate zones: the coastal region, which has a more moderate climate, and the interior, which is hotter and drier. The dry season, which runs from October to April, is the best time to visit Oman, as the temperatures are mild and pleasant, ranging from 25°C to 30°C. The wet season, which runs from May to September, is characterized by extremely hot temperatures, often reaching 45°C, and high humidity, making it uncomfortable for outdoor activities.

The seasons in Oman have a significant impact on travel, with the peak season being from December to February, when the weather is at its best, and tourists flock to the country to enjoy the pleasant temperatures and outdoor activities. The budget season, which runs from April to May, is a good time to visit Oman for travelers on a tight budget, as the prices for accommodations and tourist services are lower. However, the summer months, from June to September, are best avoided, as the temperatures are extremely hot, and outdoor activities are limited.

The climate in Oman also varies depending on the region, with the coastal areas being more moderate, and the interior being hotter and drier. The **mountainous regions**, such as the Jebel Akhdar, have a cooler climate, with temperatures ranging from 15°C to 25°C, making them a popular destination for hiking and trekking. The **desert regions**, such as the Wahiba Sands, are extremely hot during the summer months, but offer a unique opportunity to experience the Omani desert culture and landscape.
