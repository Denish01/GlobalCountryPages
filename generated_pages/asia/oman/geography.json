The country has a long coastline along the Arabian Sea to the east and the Gulf of Oman to the northeast. This strategic location has made Oman an important trading hub and cultural crossroads throughout history. The country's borders are defined by a combination of natural and artificial boundaries, including the **Hajar Mountains** to the north and the **Rub' al Khali** desert to the west.\n\nThe country's unique geography has played a significant role in shaping its history and culture. The coastline has provided access to the Indian Ocean and facilitated trade with other regions, while the mountains and deserts have created natural barriers that have influenced the development of settlements and trade routes. Oman's location at the mouth of the Persian Gulf has also made it an important center for the **pearl trade** and other maritime activities. The country's borders have been relatively stable since the 19th century, with some minor adjustments made in the 20th century.\n\n[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]\nOman's terrain is characterized by a diverse range of landscapes, including mountains, deserts, and coastlines. The **Hajar Mountains** run along the northern coast, with peaks reaching elevations of over 3,000 meters. These mountains are home to a variety of flora and fauna, including **acacia trees**, **olive trees**, and **ibex**. The mountains also contain several **wadis**, or dry riverbeds, which flow with water during the rainy season and support a range of plant and animal life.\n\nTo the south of the mountains lies the **Omani Desert**, a vast expanse of sand dunes and gravel plains that covers much of the country. This desert is part of the larger **Arabian Desert**, which stretches across the Arabian Peninsula. The desert landscape is dotted with **oases**, or fertile areas that support date palm trees and other crops. The coastal regions of Oman are generally flat and narrow, with **sandy beaches** and **rocky shores** that provide habitat for a range of marine life.\n\nThe country's coastline is also marked by several **bays** and **inlets**, including the **Gulf of Oman** and the **Musandam Peninsula**. These coastal features have played an important role in Oman's maritime history and continue to support fishing and other industries. The coastline is also home to several **islands**, including **Masirah Island** and **Khasab**, which are known for their natural beauty and unique wildlife.\n\n[SECTION] Climate By Season [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Season | Months | Temperature Range | Rainfall | Conditions |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Winter | December to February | 15-25°C | low | mild, sunny |\n| Spring | March to May | 20-35°C | low | hot, humid |\n| Summer | June to August | 30-45°C | very low | extremely hot, dry |\n| Autumn | September to November | 20-35°C | low | warm, sunny |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Time To Visit [/SECTION]\n[CALLOUT] Best months: October to April.
