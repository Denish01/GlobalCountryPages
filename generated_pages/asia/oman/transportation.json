  "content": "To get around in Oman, you can use a variety of transportation options, including domestic flights, buses, taxis, and rental cars, as well as explore the country's limited but improving public transportation system.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMain International Airport(s): Muscat International Airport (MCT), Salalah Airport (SLL)\nDomestic Air Network: limited\nRail Network: none\nDrives On: right\nRoad Quality: good\nRide-Hailing Apps: Uber, Careem\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]\nOman is easily accessible by air, with Muscat International Airport being the primary entry point for most visitors. The airport is well-connected to major hubs in the Middle East, Europe, and Asia, with direct flights to destinations such as Dubai, Abu Dhabi, London, and Mumbai. Additionally, Salalah Airport in the southern region of the country also receives international flights, particularly during the summer months when the city hosts the famous Khareef festival. For those traveling overland, Oman shares borders with the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen, with several border crossings available for entry by car or bus.\n\nFor travelers planning to enter Oman by land, the most common overland entry points are the border crossings at Wadi Jizzi, which connects to the UAE, and the border crossing at Ramlat Khaimah, which connects to Saudi Arabia. It is essential to note that these border crossings may have specific requirements, such as obtaining a visa or car insurance, and it is recommended to check with the relevant authorities before embarking on your journey. Furthermore, it is also possible to enter Oman by sea, with several ports along the coastline, including the Port of Muscat and the Port of Salalah, which receive cargo ships and cruise liners.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nOman's domestic air network is limited, with only a few routes available, primarily operated by Oman Air. The main domestic routes connect Muscat to Salalah, Khasab, and Duqm, with flights operating several times a week. Booking domestic flights in advance is recommended, especially during peak travel seasons, as the limited number of flights can fill up quickly. Approximate costs for domestic flights can range from $100 to $200 USD, depending on the route and time of booking. It is also worth noting that Oman Air offers a range of booking options, including online check-in and mobile check-in, making it convenient for travelers to manage their flights.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nOman does not have a rail network, making it one of the few countries in the world without a railway system. As a result, there are no train options available for domestic travel, and visitors must rely on other modes of transportation, such as buses, taxis, or rental cars. However, there have been plans to develop a rail network in the country, with proposals for a railway line connecting Muscat to other major cities, but these plans are still in the development stage.\n\n[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]\nIntercity bus services in Oman are operated by several companies, including the Oman National Transport Company (ONTC) and the Mwasalat bus company. These buses connect major cities, such as Muscat, Salalah, and Sohar, with frequent departures throughout the day. The quality of the buses is generally good, with comfortable seating and air-conditioning. Ticket prices are relatively affordable, ranging from $5 to $20 USD, depending on the route and class of service. It is recommended to book tickets in advance, especially during peak travel seasons, to ensure availability.\n\n[SECTION] City Transport [/SECTION]\n| Mode | Available In | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metro/Subway | none | - | Oman does not have a metro system |\n| City Bus | Muscat, Salalah | $1-$2 | Frequent departures, affordable fares |\n| Taxi | everywhere | $3-$5/km | Metered taxis, available at airports and cities |\n| Ride-Hailing | Muscat, Salalah | $5-$10 | Uber and Careem operate in major cities |\n| Tuk-tuk/Rickshaw | none | - | Not a common mode of transport in Oman |\n\n[SECTION] Driving [/SECTION]\n- To drive in Oman, you will need to obtain a temporary driving permit or an International Driving Permit (IDP) if you plan to rent a car.\n- Oman has a well-developed road network, with good road quality and minimal traffic congestion outside of major cities.\n- Fuel costs in Oman are relatively low, with gasoline prices ranging from $0.50 to $1.00 USD per liter.\n- Car rental companies are widely available at airports and cities, with a range of vehicles to choose from, including sedans, SUVs, and 4x4s.\n- When driving in Oman, be aware of the country's strict traffic laws, including the requirement to wear seatbelts and use headlights during the day.\n- Additionally, be prepared for varying road conditions, including sandstorms and fog, which can reduce visibility and make driving hazardous.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- When using taxis, make sure to agree on the fare before starting your journey, as some drivers may not use meters.\n- Be aware of your surroundings and keep valuables secure, especially in crowded areas and tourist hotspots.\n- Download the Oman Air and Mwasalat bus company apps to book flights and bus tickets in advance.\n- Consider purchasing a local SIM card or portable Wi-Fi hotspot to stay connected during your trip.\n- Be respectful of local customs and traditions, especially when interacting with locals or visiting mosques and other cultural sites.\n- When driving, be prepared for unexpected sandstorms or fog, and reduce your speed accordingly to ensure safety.\n- Keep your vehicle in good condition, with regular maintenance and checks, to avoid breakdowns and accidents.",
