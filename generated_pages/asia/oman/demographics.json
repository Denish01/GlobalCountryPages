The country's population growth rate is approximately 2.0%, which is relatively high compared to other countries in the region. Oman's population is predominantly urban, with around 77% of the population residing in cities, particularly in the capital city of Muscat. The country's urbanization trend is driven by the availability of employment opportunities, education, and healthcare services in urban areas. Migration patterns in Oman are also significant, with many expatriates coming to the country to work in various sectors, including oil and gas, construction, and services.\n\nOman's population size is relatively small compared to other countries in the region, but its strategic location and rich natural resources have made it an attractive destination for migrants and investors.

However, the government is also taking steps to manage population growth and ensure that it is sustainable and aligned with the country's development goals.\n\nThe population of Oman is also characterized by a relatively young age structure, with a median age of 25 years. This has significant implications for the country's economy and society, as a large proportion of the population is in the working age group and is contributing to the country's economic development.
