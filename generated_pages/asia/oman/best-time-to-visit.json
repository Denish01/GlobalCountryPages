Peak season: December to February. Budget season: April to May. Avoid: June to September due to the hot summer temperatures. [/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]\nOman has a **desert climate**, with very little rainfall throughout the year. The country can be divided into two main climate zones: the coastal region, which has a more moderate climate, and the interior, which is hotter and drier. The dry season, which runs from October to April, is the best time to visit Oman, as the temperatures are mild and pleasant, ranging from 25°C to 30°C. The wet season, which runs from May to September, is characterized by extremely hot temperatures, often reaching 45°C, and high humidity, making it uncomfortable for outdoor activities.\n\nThe seasons in Oman have a significant impact on travel, with the peak season being from December to February, when the weather is at its best, and tourists flock to the country to enjoy the pleasant temperatures and outdoor activities. The budget season, which runs from April to May, is a good time to visit Oman for travelers on a tight budget, as the prices for accommodations and tourist services are lower. However, the summer months, from June to September, are best avoided, as the temperatures are extremely hot, and outdoor activities are limited.\n\nThe climate in Oman also varies depending on the region, with the coastal areas being more moderate, and the interior being hotter and drier. The **mountainous regions**, such as the Jebel Akhdar, have a cooler climate, with temperatures ranging from 15°C to 25°C, making them a popular destination for hiking and trekking. The **desert regions**, such as the Wahiba Sands, are extremely hot during the summer months, but offer a unique opportunity to experience the Omani desert culture and landscape.\n\n[SECTION] Month-by-Month Guide [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Month | Weather | Crowds | Prices | Best For |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| January | Mild, 25°C | Low | $ | Outdoor activities, hiking |\n| February | Pleasant, 25°C | Med | $$ | Cultural events, festivals |\n| March | Warm, 28°C | Med | $$ | Beach activities, water sports |\n| April | Hot, 32°C | Low | $ | Budget travel, sightseeing |\n| May | Very hot, 38°C | Low | $ | Indoor activities, shopping |\n| June | Extremely hot, 45°C | Very Low | $ | Avoid traveling, stay indoors |\n| July | Extremely hot, 45°C | Very Low | $ | Avoid traveling, stay indoors |\n| August | Extremely hot, 45°C | Very Low | $ | Avoid traveling, stay indoors |\n| September | Hot, 38°C | Low | $ | Indoor activities, shopping |\n| October | Warm, 32°C | Med | $$ | Outdoor activities, hiking |\n| November | Mild, 28°C | Med | $$ | Cultural events, festivals |\n| December | Pleasant, 25°C | High | $$$ | Peak season, outdoor activities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Festivals & Events Calendar [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Event | Month(s) | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Muscat Festival | January-February | A cultural festival featuring music, dance, and theater performances |\n| Oman Marathon | January | A marathon that takes place in Muscat, attracting runners from around the world |\n| Salalah Festival | July-August | A festival that celebrates the summer monsoon season, with music, dance, and cultural events |\n| Eid al-Fitr | June-July | A Muslim holiday that marks the end of Ramadan, with festivities and celebrations throughout the country |\n| National Day | November | A national holiday that celebrates Oman's independence, with parades, fireworks, and cultural events |\n| Oman International Film Festival | December | A film festival that showcases Omani and international films, with screenings and workshops |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Variations [/SECTION]\n- The **coastal regions**, such as Muscat and Salalah, have a more moderate climate, with temperatures ranging from 25°C to 35°C, making them ideal for outdoor activities.\n- The **mountainous regions**, such as the Jebel Akhdar, have a cooler climate, with temperatures ranging from 15°C to 25°C, making them a popular destination for hiking and trekking.\n- The **desert regions**, such as the Wahiba Sands, are extremely hot during the summer months, but offer a unique opportunity to experience the Omani desert culture and landscape.\n- The **southern region**, such as Dhofar, has a distinct climate, with a summer monsoon season that brings rain and cooler temperatures, making it a popular destination during the summer months.\n- The **northern region**, such as Musandam, has a more moderate climate, with temperatures ranging from 25°C to 35°C, making it a popular destination for outdoor activities and water sports.\n\n[SECTION] Practical Tips [/SECTION]\n- Book your accommodations and tourist services well in advance, especially during the peak season, to avoid high prices and availability issues.\n- Take advantage of the shoulder season, from April to May, to enjoy lower prices and smaller crowds.\n- Pack lightweight and breathable clothing, as well as sun protection, such as hats, sunglasses, and sunscreen, to protect yourself from the sun.\n- Avoid traveling during the summer months, from June to September, due to the extremely hot temperatures and high humidity.\n- Consider visiting during the winter months, from December to February, to enjoy the pleasant temperatures and outdoor activities.\n- Be respectful of Omani culture and traditions, especially during Ramadan, and avoid traveling during the Eid al-Fitr holiday, when many businesses and tourist attractions are closed.",
