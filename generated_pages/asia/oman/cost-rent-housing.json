Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, with a deposit requirement of one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected under Omani law, which requires landlords to provide a written contract and maintain the property in good condition. Compared to its regional neighbors, Oman's housing costs are generally higher than those in Saudi Arabia and Yemen, but lower than those in the UAE.\n\nThe Omani government has implemented various initiatives to regulate the housing market and provide affordable housing options for citizens and expatriates. These initiatives include the development of new residential areas and the introduction of rent control measures to prevent excessive price increases. However, the demand for housing in Oman remains high, particularly in the capital city, which can drive up prices and make it challenging for renters to find affordable options.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $350-$500 | $200-$350 | Compact, basic amenities |\n| 1 Bedroom | $400-$700 | $250-$500 | Average size, standard amenities |\n| 2 Bedroom | $600-$1,000 | $400-$800 | Family size, additional amenities |\n| 3 Bedroom | $900-$1,500 | $600-$1,200 | Spacious, luxury amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $2,500-$4,000 | Prime locations, high demand |\n| Suburbs | $1,500-$3,000 | Residential areas, family-friendly |\n| Rural | $500-$1,500 | Limited amenities, natural surroundings |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- Al Khuwair: A popular area for expats, with a range of apartments and villas available, typical rent range $400-$800 USD (155-310 OMR) per month.\n- Shatti Al Qurum: A upscale neighborhood with luxury apartments and amenities, typical rent range $600-$1,200 USD (230-465 OMR) per month.\n- Madinat Al Sultan Qaboos: A family-friendly area with a mix of apartments and villas, typical rent range $500-$1,000 USD (195-390 OMR) per month.\n- Muscat Hills: A gated community with luxury villas and amenities, typical rent range $1,000-$2,000 USD (390-780 OMR) per month.\n- Ruwi: A commercial area with a range of apartments and offices, typical rent range $300-$600 USD (115-230 OMR) per month.\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Oman [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods and prices thoroughly to find the best value for your budget.\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent to find a suitable property and negotiate the rent.\n- Be prepared to pay a deposit and one month's rent in advance.\n- Check the property carefully before signing the lease to ensure it is in good condition.\n- Consider the cost of utilities, which are usually not included in the rent, and factor them into your budget.\n- Be aware of scams and never pay a deposit without a written contract and proof of ownership.",
