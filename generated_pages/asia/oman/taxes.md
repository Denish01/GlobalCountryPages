Oman has a **territorial taxation** system, where only income earned within the country is subject to tax, and foreign-earned income is generally exempt.

Oman's tax system is designed to encourage foreign investment and economic growth, with a range of incentives and exemptions available to businesses and individuals. The country has a relatively simple tax regime, with a limited number of taxes and a straightforward filing process. However, tax laws and regulations can change frequently, so it is essential to consult a qualified tax professional for advice specific to your situation.
