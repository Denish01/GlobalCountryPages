[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The Omani property market has experienced significant growth in recent years, driven by government investment in infrastructure and tourism. However, the market has slowed down in recent years due to the decline in oil prices and the COVID-19 pandemic. The current market conditions are characterized by a surplus of supply, particularly in the residential sector, which has led to a decrease in prices. The urban areas, such as Muscat, are more popular among investors and buyers, while the rural areas are relatively less developed. The price trajectory is expected to remain stable, with some fluctuations in the short term.

The Omani government has implemented various initiatives to boost the property market, including the introduction of **freehold** ownership for foreigners in certain areas, such as **integrated tourism complexes**. This has attracted a significant number of foreign investors, particularly from the Gulf region. However, the market is still largely driven by local demand, and the government's efforts to diversify the economy are expected to have a positive impact on the property market in the long term.

The rental market in Oman is also experiencing a slowdown, with a decrease in demand for residential and commercial properties. However, the demand for **affordable housing** is still high, particularly among the local population. The government has implemented various initiatives to address this issue, including the construction of **affordable housing units** and the provision of **subsidies** for low-income families.
