[SECTION] How Oman Is Divided [/SECTION]
Oman is divided into 11 governorates, each with its own distinct character and administrative structure. The governorates are further subdivided into provinces, which are then divided into smaller districts. This administrative structure allows for a more localized approach to governance, taking into account the unique needs and characteristics of each region. The 11 governorates are: Muscat, Ad Dakhiliyah, Al Batinah North, Al Batinah South, Al Buraimi, Ad Dhahirah, Al Wusta, Ash Sharqiyah North, Ash Sharqiyah South, Dhofar, and Musandam.

The division of Oman into governorates is based on a combination of geographical, cultural, and economic factors. Each governorate has its own regional characteristics, such as climate, terrain, and natural resources, which shape the local economy and way of life. For example, the governorates in the north are generally more urbanized and industrialized, while those in the south are more rural and agricultural. Understanding the administrative structure of Oman is essential for navigating the country and appreciating its diverse regions and cultures.
