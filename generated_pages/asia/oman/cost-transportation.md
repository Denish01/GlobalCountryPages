[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Oman has a well-developed transportation network, with a range of options available for getting around, including buses, taxis, and ride-hailing services. The quality of public transit in Oman is generally good, with modern buses and well-maintained roads. However, the availability of public transportation can vary depending on the location, with larger cities like Muscat having more comprehensive networks than smaller towns and rural areas. Most people in Oman get around by car, with many residents owning their own vehicles, but there are also plenty of options for those who prefer not to drive.

The country's transportation system is designed to cater to both locals and tourists, with many signs and announcements in English as well as Arabic. The road network in Oman is well-developed, with several major highways connecting the main cities and towns. However, driving in Oman can be challenging, especially for those who are not used to driving in a Middle Eastern country, with aggressive driving styles and limited parking options in some areas.
