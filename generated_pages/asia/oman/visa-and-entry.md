# Oman Visa & Entry Requirements

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Oman before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Oman has a moderate visa policy, allowing citizens of certain countries to enter visa-free, while others require a visa on arrival or prior to arrival. Citizens of over 70 countries, including the US, UK, and EU member states, can enter Oman without a pre-arranged visa. However, the type of visa and duration of stay vary depending on the nationality and purpose of visit. Oman's visa policy aims to balance the need to facilitate tourism and business travel with the need to maintain national security and control over immigration.

Oman's visa policy is designed to promote tourism and economic development, while also ensuring the safety and security of its citizens and visitors. The country offers a range of visa options, including tourist visas, business visas, and transit visas, each with its own set of requirements and regulations. Visitors can apply for a visa online or through the embassy or consulate of Oman in their home country.

The main airports in Oman are Muscat International Airport and Salalah International Airport, which receive most international flights. Land borders are also open with the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen, but travelers must ensure they have the necessary visas and documentation. Upon arrival, visitors must present their passport, visa (if required), and completed arrival/departure card to the immigration officer. The officer may ask questions about the purpose of visit, length of stay, and accommodation arrangements. Visitors must also declare any restricted or prohibited items, such as firearms or narcotics.

After clearing immigration, visitors can collect their baggage and proceed to customs, where they may be required to declare certain items, such as gifts or electronics. The customs officer may inspect the baggage and ask questions about the contents. Visitors can then exchange currency, purchase a local SIM card, or hire a taxi to reach their destination. It is recommended to have a copy of the hotel reservation or address of the accommodation, as well as a map or GPS device to navigate the city.
