        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Oman has a rich and diverse history dating back to the 6th millennium BC. The country's strategic location at the mouth of the Persian Gulf made it an important center for trade and commerce. In the 7th century AD, Oman was one of the first countries to adopt <strong>Islam</strong>, and it has remained a predominantly Muslim country ever since. The <strong>Portuguese</strong> colonized Oman in the 16th century, but they were expelled in 1650 by the <strong>Yaruba dynasty</strong>, which ruled the country for over a century. In the 18th century, Oman was a major power in the region, with a significant presence in the <strong>Indian Ocean</strong> and <strong>East Africa</strong>.</p>
        <p>In the 20th century, Oman was a <strong>British protectorate</strong>, with the UK controlling the country's foreign affairs. Oman gained its independence on November 18, 1971, with <strong>Sultan Qaboos bin Said Al Said</strong> as its ruler. Since then, the country has undergone significant modernization and development, with a focus on <strong>education</strong>, <strong>healthcare</strong>, and <strong>infrastructure</strong>. Today, Oman is a <strong>sovereign state</strong> with a <strong>monarchical</strong> system of government, and it is a member of various international organizations, including the <strong>United Nations</strong> and the <strong>Gulf Cooperation Council</strong>.</p>
        <p>Oman's history is also marked by its <strong>tribal</strong> heritage, with various tribes playing an important role in the country's social and cultural fabric. The <strong>Al Said</strong> tribe, to which the ruling family belongs, has been a dominant force in Omani politics and society for centuries. The country's history is also characterized by its <strong>maritime</strong> traditions, with Oman having a long history of shipbuilding and seafaring.</p>
        <p>The country's <strong>economic</strong> history is also significant, with Oman having a long history of trade and commerce. The country's <strong>oil</strong> reserves were discovered in the 1960s, and since then, oil has been a major driver of the country's economy. However, in recent years, Oman has been diversifying its economy, with a focus on <strong>tourism</strong>, <strong>manufacturing</strong>, and <strong>services</strong>.</p>
