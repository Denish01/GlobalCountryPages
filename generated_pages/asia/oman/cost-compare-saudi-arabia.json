Oman has a more diverse economy, with a strong focus on tourism, manufacturing, and logistics, while Saudi Arabia's economy is largely driven by oil exports. In terms of cost of living, Oman tends to be cheaper than Saudi Arabia, particularly when it comes to housing, food, and transportation. However, the cost difference between the two countries can vary depending on the specific location, lifestyle, and personal preferences.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Oman has a relatively small population and a more relaxed pace of life, which can contribute to lower costs, while Saudi Arabia has a larger population and a more fast-paced economy, which can drive up costs. Additionally, the exchange rates and inflation rates in the two countries can also impact the cost of living. Overall, Oman's more diverse economy and relaxed pace of life make it a more affordable option for expats and tourists, while Saudi Arabia's larger economy and more extensive infrastructure make it a more attractive option for business and investment.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Oman (USD) | Saudi Arabia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 450 | 550 | 18% more expensive in Saudi Arabia |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 300 | 400 | 25% more expensive in Saudi Arabia |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 800 | 1,000 | 20% more expensive in Saudi Arabia |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Oman (USD) | Saudi Arabia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 10 | 12 | 17% more expensive in Saudi Arabia |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 200 | 250 | 20% more expensive in Saudi Arabia |\n| Beer (500ml) | 5 | 7 | 29% more expensive in Saudi Arabia |\n| Coffee | 2 | 3 | 33% more expensive in Saudi Arabia |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Oman (USD) | Saudi Arabia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 50 | 70 | 29% more expensive in Saudi Arabia |\n| Taxi (per km) | 1.5 | 2 | 25% more expensive in Saudi Arabia |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 0.5 | 0.6 | 17% more expensive in Saudi Arabia |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Oman (USD) | Saudi Arabia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 100 | 120 | 17% more expensive in Saudi Arabia |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 30 | 40 | 25% more expensive in Saudi Arabia |\n| Mobile Plan | 20 | 25 | 20% more expensive in Saudi Arabia |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Oman (USD) | Saudi Arabia (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 1,200 | 1,500 | 20% savings in Oman |\n| Mid-Range | 2,000 | 2,500 | 20% savings in Oman |\n| Comfortable | 3,500 | 4,500 | 22% savings in Oman |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Oman is cheaper for:**\n  - Rent and housing, with prices up to 25% lower than in Saudi Arabia\n  - Food and dining, with meal prices up to 20% lower than in Saudi Arabia\n  - Transportation, with fuel prices up to 17% lower than in Saudi Arabia\n  - Utilities and internet, with prices up to 25% lower than in Saudi Arabia\n- **Saudi Arabia is cheaper for:**\n  - Luxury goods and high-end shopping, with prices up to 15% lower than in Oman\n  - Business and investment opportunities, with a larger and more extensive infrastructure\n  - Entertainment and leisure activities, with a wider range of options and events\n  - Education, with a number of reputable universities and institutions\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nOman and Saudi Arabia offer distinct advantages and disadvantages for different lifestyles and preferences.
