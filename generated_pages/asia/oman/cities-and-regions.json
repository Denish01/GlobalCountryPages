The governorates are further subdivided into provinces, which are then divided into smaller districts. This administrative structure allows for a more localized approach to governance, taking into account the unique needs and characteristics of each region. The 11 governorates are: Muscat, Ad Dakhiliyah, Al Batinah North, Al Batinah South, Al Buraimi, Ad Dhahirah, Al Wusta, Ash Sharqiyah North, Ash Sharqiyah South, Dhofar, and Musandam.\n\nThe division of Oman into governorates is based on a combination of geographical, cultural, and economic factors. Each governorate has its own regional characteristics, such as climate, terrain, and natural resources, which shape the local economy and way of life. For example, the governorates in the north are generally more urbanized and industrialized, while those in the south are more rural and agricultural. Understanding the administrative structure of Oman is essential for navigating the country and appreciating its diverse regions and cultures.\n\n[SECTION] Major Cities [/SECTION]\n**Muscat** (1.5M)\nRole: capital, economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: its stunning natural harbor, historic architecture, and vibrant cultural scene\nBest For: visitors interested in history, culture, and business\n\n**Seeb** (470,878)\nRole: economic hub, port city\nKnown For: its bustling port, modern infrastructure, and shopping centers\nBest For: visitors interested in trade, commerce, and entertainment\n\n**Salalah** (340,815)\nRole: cultural center, tourist hub\nKnown For: its stunning beaches, historic architecture, and vibrant cultural scene\nBest For: visitors interested in history, culture, and relaxation\n\n**Sohar** (220,996)\nRole: industrial hub, port city\nKnown For: its strategic location, industrial infrastructure, and historic significance\nBest For: visitors interested in industry, trade, and history\n\n**Nizwa** (140,006)\nRole: cultural center, historic city\nKnown For: its historic architecture, vibrant souks, and stunning natural surroundings\nBest For: visitors interested in history, culture, and nature\n\n**Sur** (120,000)\nRole: port city, industrial hub\nKnown For: its stunning coastline, historic architecture, and industrial infrastructure\nBest For: visitors interested in industry, trade, and relaxation\n\n[SECTION] Key Regions [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Region | Character | Known For | Major City |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Muscat Governorate | urban, cosmopolitan | historic architecture, vibrant cultural scene | Muscat |\n| Ad Dakhiliyah Governorate | mountainous, rural | historic villages, natural scenery | Nizwa |\n| Al Batinah North Governorate | coastal, urban | ports, industrial infrastructure | Sohar |\n| Al Batinah South Governorate | coastal, rural | beaches, historic towns | Barka |\n| Dhofar Governorate | southern, tropical | stunning beaches, historic architecture | Salalah |\n| Musandam Governorate | northern, mountainous | stunning coastline, historic villages | Khasab |\n| Ash Sharqiyah North Governorate | coastal, rural | beaches, historic towns | Ibra |\n| Ash Sharqiyah South Governorate | coastal, urban | ports, industrial infrastructure | Sur |\n| Ad Dhahirah Governorate | inland, rural | historic villages, natural scenery | Ibri |\n| Al Buraimi Governorate | inland, urban | historic towns, industrial infrastructure | Al Buraimi |\n| Al Wusta Governorate | central, desert | historic villages, natural scenery | Haima |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Differences [/SECTION]\n- Culture: Oman's regions have distinct cultural identities, shaped by their history, geography, and traditions.
