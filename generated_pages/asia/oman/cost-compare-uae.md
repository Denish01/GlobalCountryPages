[SECTION] Overview: Oman vs UAE [/SECTION]
The cost of living in Oman and the UAE varies significantly, despite both countries being located in the same region. Oman has a more laid-back and traditional atmosphere, which is reflected in its lower cost of living. The country has a strong economy, driven by its oil and gas industry, but it is not as diversified as the UAE's economy. As a result, Oman has a lower cost of living, making it an attractive option for expats and tourists. The UAE, on the other hand, is a more modern and cosmopolitan country, with a highly developed economy and a high standard of living. However, this comes at a cost, and the UAE is generally more expensive than Oman.

The economic context of both countries also plays a role in their cost of living. Oman has a smaller and more limited economy, which means that there is less demand for goods and services, and therefore prices are lower. The UAE, on the other hand, has a large and diversified economy, with a high demand for goods and services, which drives up prices. Additionally, the UAE has a highly developed tourism industry, which also contributes to its higher cost of living. Overall, Oman is generally considered to be around 10-20% cheaper than the UAE, making it a more affordable option for those looking to live or visit the region.
