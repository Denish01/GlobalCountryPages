The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of high quality and is available to all citizens, with foreigners often opting for private healthcare services. The public healthcare system is funded by the government, with patients required to pay a small fee for services. Private healthcare services, on the other hand, are more expensive but often offer more specialized care and shorter waiting times. Locals typically have access to public healthcare services, while foreigners often prefer private healthcare services, especially those with health insurance.\n\nThe healthcare system in Oman is well-regulated, with both public and private healthcare providers required to meet certain standards. However, the quality of care can vary significantly depending on the provider and the location. In general, healthcare services in Muscat, the capital city, are considered to be of higher quality than those in other parts of the country. It is recommended that foreigners have health insurance to cover any medical expenses, as the cost of healthcare in Oman can be high, especially for private services.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $10-$20 | $50-$100 | Public clinics often have shorter waiting times for locals |\n| Specialist Consultation | $20-$50 | $100-$200 | Private hospitals often have more specialized care |\n| Dental Checkup | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Private dental clinics often have more advanced equipment |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$30 | $30-$50 | Public hospitals often have longer waiting times for eye exams |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $20-$50 | Private labs often have faster turnaround times for test results |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$100 | Public hospitals often have longer waiting times |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $100-$500 | Private hospitals often have more luxurious accommodations |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$2,000 | Private hospitals often have more specialized care |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,000-$3,000 | Private hospitals often have more advanced equipment |\n| MRI Scan | $100-$300 | Private hospitals often have more modern equipment |\n| X-Ray | $20-$50 | Public hospitals often have longer waiting times for X-rays |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Public healthcare services, basic medical procedures |\n| Comprehensive Private | $200-$500 | Private healthcare services, specialized care, hospital stays |\n| International / Expat | $500-$1,000 | International healthcare services, emergency evacuations, comprehensive coverage |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medication can be purchased at pharmacies with a valid prescription from a licensed doctor\n- Over-the-counter medication is widely available at pharmacies and supermarkets\n- The cost of medication can vary significantly depending on the type and brand, with generic options often being cheaper\n- Pharmacies are widely available in urban areas, but may be less accessible in rural areas\n- Some pharmacies may offer delivery services or online ordering with delivery\n- It is recommended to always check the expiration date and packaging of medication before purchasing\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the emergency number 9999 or visit the nearest hospital.
