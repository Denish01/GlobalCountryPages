The **Majlis Oman**, or Consultative Council, is a bicameral legislature that provides advice to the Sultan, but it has limited powers and does not have the authority to make laws. The government is divided into several ministries, each responsible for a specific area of policy, such as defense, education, and health.

The political system in Oman is also influenced by **Islamic law**, or **sharia**, which plays a significant role in the country's legal system. The government has implemented various policies aimed at promoting **social welfare** and **economic development**, and has sought to maintain a balance between **traditional values** and **modernization**. The Sultan has also introduced various reforms aimed at increasing **participation** and **transparency** in the government, including the establishment of the **Majlis al-Shura**, a consultative council that provides advice on legislation and policy.

The country has a **unitary system** of government, with a single, centralized authority that exercises control over the entire country.
