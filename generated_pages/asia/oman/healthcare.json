The public healthcare system is generally of high quality, with well-equipped hospitals and clinics, especially in urban areas. However, there may be some differences in the quality of care between public and private providers, with private hospitals often having more advanced equipment and specialized staff. In terms of access, urban areas like Muscat have a higher concentration of healthcare facilities, while rural areas may have more limited options.\n\nThe Omani government has made significant investments in healthcare infrastructure, including the construction of new hospitals and the expansion of existing ones. This has helped to improve access to healthcare services, especially for Omani citizens. However, expatriates and tourists may need to rely on private healthcare providers, which can be more expensive. Despite these differences, Oman's healthcare system is generally considered to be of high quality, with many healthcare professionals having received training in countries like the UK and the US.\n\nOverall, Oman's healthcare system is well-equipped to handle a range of medical conditions, from routine check-ups to complex surgeries.
