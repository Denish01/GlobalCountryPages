Cambodia has a lower GDP per capita and a more rapidly growing economy, which has led to a relatively low cost of living. In contrast, Laos has a higher GDP per capita and a more stable economy, but it also has a higher cost of living. Overall, Cambodia is generally cheaper than Laos, with a cost of living that is around 10-20% lower.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries is also different, with Cambodia having a more diverse economy with a strong focus on tourism, manufacturing, and agriculture, while Laos has a more limited economy with a strong focus on natural resources and hydropower. This has led to differences in the cost of living, with Cambodia having a more developed tourist infrastructure and a wider range of accommodation options, while Laos has a more limited range of options, but a more relaxed and peaceful atmosphere. For expats, students, and retirees, Cambodia may offer better value for money, while for families and those looking for a more relaxed lifestyle, Laos may be a better option.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cambodia (USD) | Laos (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 250 | 350 | 29% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 150 | 200 | 25% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 500 | 700 | 29% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cambodia (USD) | Laos (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 3 | 5 | 40% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 100 | 150 | 33% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | 1 | 2 | 50% cheaper |\n| Coffee | 1 | 2 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cambodia (USD) | Laos (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 10 | 15 | 33% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | 0.50 | 1.00 | 50% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 0.80 | 1.20 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cambodia (USD) | Laos (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 50 | 70 | 29% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 20 | 30 | 33% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | 5 | 10 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Cambodia (USD) | Laos (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 500 | 700 | 29% |\n| Mid-Range | 1,000 | 1,400 | 29% |\n| Comfortable | 2,000 | 2,800 | 29% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Cambodia is cheaper for:**\n- Rent and housing, with prices up to 29% lower than in Laos\n- Food and dining, with meal prices up to 40% lower than in Laos\n- Transportation, with taxi fares up to 50% lower than in Laos\n- Utilities and internet, with prices up to 33% lower than in Laos\n- **Laos is cheaper for:**\n- Some types of groceries, such as fresh produce and meat\n- Certain types of accommodation, such as guesthouses and hostels\n- Some tourist activities, such as trekking and outdoor adventures\n- Certain types of transportation, such as bus fares and motorcycle rentals\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nFor expats, students, and retirees, Cambodia may offer better value for money, with a lower cost of living and a wider range of accommodation options.
