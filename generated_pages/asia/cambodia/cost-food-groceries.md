[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Food prices in Cambodia are generally lower compared to the regional average, with a meal at a local eatery costing around $3 to $5 per person. The cost of food is driven by factors such as the country's agricultural production, transportation costs, and market demand. The eating-out culture is prevalent in Cambodia, with many locals and tourists alike opting for street food and local eateries. However, home cooking is also a popular option, with many households preparing their own meals using fresh ingredients from local markets. The low cost of food in Cambodia makes it an attractive destination for travelers and expats, with a wide range of affordable dining options available.

The low inflation rate of 0.8% in 2024 has helped to keep food prices stable, making it easier for consumers to budget for their daily meals. Additionally, the country's GDP per capita PPP of $7,967 in 2024 has increased the purchasing power of locals, allowing them to afford a wider range of food options. However, the high out-of-pocket health spend of 60.6% in 2023 may affect the food choices of some individuals, with a greater emphasis on affordable and nutritious options.

[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]
The prices of groceries in Cambodia can vary depending on whether you shop at a supermarket or a local market. Generally, supermarkets tend to be more expensive, with prices around 10-20% higher than those at local markets. However, supermarkets often offer a wider range of products, including imported goods, and may have better quality control. Local markets, on the other hand, offer a more traditional shopping experience, with fresh produce, meats, and other staples available at competitive prices. When shopping at local markets, it's common to bargain, with vendors often willing to lower their prices for bulk purchases or regular customers.

When deciding where to shop, consider what you need to buy. For fresh produce, local markets are often the best option, with a wide range of fruits and vegetables available at competitive prices. For dry goods, such as rice, noodles, and canned goods, supermarkets may be a better option, with a wider range of products available. For meats and seafood, local markets often offer the freshest options, with vendors willing to clean and prepare the products for you. Ultimately, a combination of both supermarket and local market shopping can provide the best of both worlds, with a wide range of products available at competitive prices.
