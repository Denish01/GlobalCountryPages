[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Cambodia has a **territorial tax system**, meaning that tax is levied on income earned within the country, regardless of the tax residency status of the individual or company. However, **worldwide taxation** applies to residents, who are taxed on their global income, with credits available for foreign taxes paid. To be considered a tax resident in Cambodia, an individual must have a principal place of residence in the country, or stay in the country for more than 182 days in a calendar year. Non-residents are taxed only on their Cambodian-sourced income.

The Cambodian tax system is relatively simple, with a focus on **tax compliance** and **revenue collection**. The General Department of Taxation (GDT) is responsible for administering taxes, and taxpayers can file returns and make payments online or through authorized banks. Cambodia has also introduced various **tax incentives** to attract foreign investment and stimulate economic growth.
