[SECTION] Overview: Cambodia vs Laos [/SECTION]
Cambodia and Laos are two neighboring countries in Southeast Asia that share many cultural and historical similarities, but they also have distinct differences in terms of their economies and cost of living. Cambodia has a lower GDP per capita and a more rapidly growing economy, which has led to a relatively low cost of living. In contrast, Laos has a higher GDP per capita and a more stable economy, but it also has a higher cost of living. Overall, Cambodia is generally cheaper than Laos, with a cost of living that is around 10-20% lower.

The economic context of the two countries is also different, with Cambodia having a more diverse economy with a strong focus on tourism, manufacturing, and agriculture, while Laos has a more limited economy with a strong focus on natural resources and hydropower. This has led to differences in the cost of living, with Cambodia having a more developed tourist infrastructure and a wider range of accommodation options, while Laos has a more limited range of options, but a more relaxed and peaceful atmosphere. For expats, students, and retirees, Cambodia may offer better value for money, while for families and those looking for a more relaxed lifestyle, Laos may be a better option.
