[SECTION] How Cambodia Is Divided [/SECTION]
Cambodia is divided into 25 provinces and the capital, Phnom Penh. The provinces are further divided into districts, communes, and villages. The administrative structure is hierarchical, with the central government in Phnom Penh overseeing the provinces, which in turn manage the districts and communes. This system allows for a balance of power between the central government and the local authorities, enabling effective governance and development across the country.

The provinces in Cambodia are diverse, ranging from the densely populated urban areas like Phnom Penh and Siem Reap, to the rural and mountainous regions like Ratanakiri and Mondulkiri. Each province has its unique character, culture, and economy, contributing to the rich tapestry of Cambodian society.
