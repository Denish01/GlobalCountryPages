# Cambodia History — Key Events & Timeline

The history of Cambodia is a complex and fascinating narrative that spans over two millennia, from the ancient **Khmer Empire** to the modern sovereign state. 

[SECTION] Historical Overview [/SECTION]
The earliest known history of Cambodia dates back to the 1st century AD, with the establishment of the **Funan Kingdom**, which was a powerful and influential state in the region. This was followed by the **Chenla Kingdom**, which emerged in the 6th century AD and played a significant role in the development of Cambodian culture and politics. The **Khmer Empire**, which rose to power in the 9th century AD, is considered the golden age of Cambodian history, with the construction of magnificent temples such as **Angkor Wat**. The empire began to decline in the 14th century AD, and Cambodia was eventually colonized by **France** in the 19th century.

The French colonial period had a profound impact on Cambodian society, with the introduction of **Western education** and **infrastructure**. However, it also led to the suppression of Cambodian culture and the exploitation of the country's resources. Cambodia gained independence from France in 1953, with **King Norodom Sihanouk** playing a key role in the country's struggle for freedom. The post-independence period was marked by political instability, with the country being drawn into the **Vietnam War** and eventually falling under the control of the **Khmer Rouge**, a communist regime that was responsible for the deaths of an estimated 1.7 to 2.2 million people.

The **Khmer Rouge** regime was ousted in 1979, and Cambodia began to rebuild and recover from the devastating effects of war and genocide. The country has made significant progress in recent years, with the establishment of a **democratic government** and the development of its **economy**. However, Cambodia still faces many challenges, including **poverty**, **corruption**, and **human rights abuses**. Despite these challenges, the country remains a popular tourist destination, with its rich culture and history, and its friendly and welcoming people.

The modern era has seen Cambodia become a key player in regional and international affairs, with the country joining organizations such as the **Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)** and the **World Trade Organization (WTO)**. Cambodia has also made significant progress in terms of economic development, with the country experiencing rapid growth in recent years.
