[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Cambodia has a relatively liberal visa policy, with citizens from over 200 countries eligible for a visa on arrival or an eVisa. The country aims to attract tourists and business travelers, and its visa policy reflects this goal. Citizens from countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and the Philippines are eligible for visa-free entry, while citizens from other countries can easily obtain a visa on arrival or through the eVisa system.

The visa policy in Cambodia is designed to be straightforward and efficient, with most nationalities able to obtain a visa on arrival or through the eVisa system. This has helped to increase tourism and business travel to the country, making it an attractive destination for travelers from around the world.

[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]
**Tourists:** Tourists can obtain a visa on arrival or through the eVisa system, and are typically granted a 30-day stay. This can be extended for an additional 30 days, but requires an application to be submitted to the immigration authorities. Tourists must also meet specific requirements, such as holding a valid passport with at least six months' validity and proof of onward travel.
**Business Travelers:** Business travelers may require a different type of visa, such as a business visa or a work visa, and must meet specific requirements, including holding an invitation letter from a Cambodian company and proof of sufficient funds. The application process for business visas can be more complex and time-consuming than for tourist visas.
**Students:** Students who wish to study in Cambodia must obtain a student visa, which requires proof of enrollment in a Cambodian educational institution and a valid passport. The student visa is typically valid for one year, but can be extended for an additional year with proof of continued enrollment.
**Workers:** Workers who wish to work in Cambodia must obtain a work visa, which requires sponsorship from a Cambodian employer and proof of qualifications and experience. The work visa is typically valid for one year, but can be extended for an additional year with proof of continued employment.

[SECTION] Documents Checklist [/SECTION]
1. A valid passport with at least six months' validity
2. A completed visa application form
3. One recent passport-sized photo
4. Proof of onward travel, such as a flight itinerary or a bus ticket
5. Proof of sufficient funds, such as cash or a credit card
6. A hotel reservation or proof of accommodation

[SECTION] Entry Points & Procedures [/SECTION]
The main entry points for Cambodia are the Phnom Penh International Airport and the Siem Reap International Airport, as well as several land border crossings with Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam. Upon arrival, travelers must proceed to the immigration counter, where they will be required to present their passport, visa application form, and other supporting documents. The immigration officer will review the documents and may ask questions about the purpose of the visit and the length of stay. If everything is in order, the traveler will be granted entry to Cambodia and a visa will be issued.

At land border crossings, the procedures are similar, but travelers may need to present additional documents, such as a vehicle registration or a driver's license. It is also a good idea to have some local currency, the Cambodian riel, to pay for any fees or services.
