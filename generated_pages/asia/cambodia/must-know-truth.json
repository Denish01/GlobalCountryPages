  "content": "[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]\nCambodia has a rich and complex history that spans over two millennia. The **Funan Kingdom**, which is considered one of the earliest civilizations in Cambodia, was established in the 1st century AD. The kingdom was later replaced by the **Chenla Kingdom** in the 6th century AD, which was then divided into two kingdoms: **Land Chenla** and **Water Chenla**. In the 9th century AD, the **Angkorian Empire** was established, and it is during this period that Cambodia experienced its golden age, with the construction of the famous **Angkor Wat** temple complex.\n\nIn the 15th century AD, the Angkorian Empire began to decline, and Cambodia was eventually colonized by **France** in the 19th century AD. The French colonization of Cambodia lasted for nearly a century, until Cambodia gained its independence on November 9, 1953. After independence, Cambodia experienced a period of instability, with the rise of the **Khmer Rouge** in the 1970s. The Khmer Rouge regime, led by **Pol Pot**, was responsible for the deaths of an estimated 1.7 to 2.2 million people, out of a population of approximately 8 million, due to executions, forced labor, and starvation.\n\nThe Khmer Rouge regime was eventually overthrown in 1979, and Cambodia has since been working to rebuild and recover.
