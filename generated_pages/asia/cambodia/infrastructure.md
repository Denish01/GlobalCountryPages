# Cambodia Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

Cambodia's infrastructure is still developing, with significant investments in recent years aimed at improving the country's roads, power generation, and telecommunications, but challenges persist, particularly in rural areas.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 71% of population
Internet Penetration: 48%
Road Network: 38,257 km, mostly paved but with varying quality
Rail Network: 612 km
Major Airports: 3
Major Ports: 2
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Cambodia's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other countries in the region, but the government has made significant efforts to improve the situation in recent years. The country has invested heavily in building new roads, expanding its power generation capacity, and improving its telecommunications network. However, a significant urban-rural gap remains, with many rural areas lacking access to basic infrastructure such as electricity, clean water, and sanitation. The government has also implemented policies to attract foreign investment and encourage private sector participation in infrastructure development.

Despite these efforts, Cambodia still faces significant infrastructure challenges, including a lack of reliable and efficient public transportation, limited access to clean water and sanitation, and frequent power outages. The country is also vulnerable to natural disasters such as floods and droughts, which can have a significant impact on its infrastructure. To address these challenges, the government has developed a comprehensive infrastructure development plan, which includes investments in roads, bridges, and other critical infrastructure.

The plan also includes measures to improve the country's disaster resilience and response capabilities, such as the construction of flood-resistant roads and bridges. Additionally, the government has established a number of special economic zones to attract foreign investment and promote economic growth. These zones are equipped with modern infrastructure, including reliable power supply, clean water, and sanitation, as well as advanced telecommunications networks.
