Peak season: December to February. Budget season: May to June. Avoid: April and May due to the hot weather, and September to November due to the heavy rainfall. [/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]\nCambodia has a tropical climate with two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from November to March, is characterized by low humidity and comfortable temperatures, making it the best time to visit the country. The wet season, which runs from April to October, is marked by heavy rainfall and high humidity, making travel more challenging. The country can be divided into two climate zones: the low-lying plains and the mountainous regions. The low-lying plains, where most of the population lives, experience a hot and humid climate, while the mountainous regions are cooler and more temperate.\n\nThe dry season is the best time to visit Cambodia's famous temples, such as **Angkor Wat**, as the weather is dry and comfortable, making it ideal for exploring the temples and the surrounding countryside. The wet season, on the other hand, can make travel more difficult, as some roads may be flooded and the heat and humidity can be oppressive. However, the wet season also has its advantages, as the countryside is lush and green, and the waterfalls are at their peak.\n\nThe seasons also affect the prices of accommodations and tourist services, with the peak season being the most expensive time to visit. The budget season, which runs from May to June, is a good time to visit if you're on a tight budget, as prices are lower and the weather is still relatively dry.\n\n[SECTION] Month-by-Month Guide [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Month | Weather | Crowds | Prices | Best For |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| January | Dry and cool | Med | $$ | Temple visits, countryside exploration |\n| February | Dry and warm | High | $$$ | Festivals, city tours |\n| March | Hot and dry | High | $$$ | Beach trips, water sports |\n| April | Hot and dry | Med | $$ | Visiting the countryside, avoiding crowds |\n| May | Hot and wet | Low | $ | Budget travelers, nature lovers |\n| June | Wet and hot | Low | $ | Visiting waterfalls, exploring the countryside |\n| July | Wet and hot | Low | $ | Visiting the beaches, trying water sports |\n| August | Wet and hot | Med | $$ | Visiting the temples, exploring the cities |\n| September | Wet and hot | Low | $ | Visiting the countryside, avoiding crowds |\n| October | Wet and cool | Med | $$ | Visiting the temples, trying festivals |\n| November | Dry and cool | Med | $$ | Temple visits, countryside exploration |\n| December | Dry and cool | High | $$$ | Festivals, city tours |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Festivals & Events Calendar [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Event | Month(s) | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Khmer New Year | April | A three-day celebration of the traditional Khmer New Year, marked by music, dance, and feasting |\n| Visak Bochea | May | A Buddhist holiday that commemorates the birth, enlightenment, and death of the Buddha |\n| Royal Ploughing Ceremony | May | A traditional ceremony that marks the beginning of the planting season |\n| Pchum Ben | September | A 15-day festival that honors the spirits of the dead |\n| Water Festival | November | A three-day celebration of the water festival, marked by boat races and fireworks |\n| Independence Day | November | A celebration of Cambodia's independence from France |\n| Christmas | December | A celebration of Christmas, marked by decorations, music, and feasting |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Variations [/SECTION]\n- The **coastal regions**, such as Sihanoukville and Kep, have a more moderate climate, with cooler temperatures and more rainfall than the inland regions.\n- The **mountainous regions**, such as Ratanakiri and Mondulkiri, have a cooler and more temperate climate, with more rainfall and mist.\n- The **low-lying plains**, such as the Mekong Delta, have a hot and humid climate, with more rainfall and flooding during the wet season.\n- The **temple regions**, such as Siem Reap and Angkor Wat, have a dry and hot climate, with more tourists and higher prices during the peak season.\n- The **countryside regions**, such as Battambang and Kampong Cham, have a more rural and traditional way of life, with more opportunities to experience the local culture and cuisine.\n\n[SECTION] Practical Tips [/SECTION]\n- Book your accommodations and tourist services well in advance, especially during the peak season, to avoid high prices and availability issues.\n- Consider visiting during the shoulder season, from April to June or from September to November, to avoid the crowds and high prices.\n- Pack accordingly, with light and breathable clothing, sunscreen, and insect repellent, to protect yourself from the sun and insects.\n- Be respectful of the local culture and customs, especially when visiting temples or attending festivals and events.\n- Avoid traveling during the holidays, such as the Khmer New Year or the Water Festival, as prices and crowds may be higher.\n- Consider purchasing travel insurance, to protect yourself against unexpected medical or travel-related expenses.",
