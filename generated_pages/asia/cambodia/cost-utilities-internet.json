  "content": "The cost of utilities and internet in Cambodia can vary depending on the location, usage, and provider, but on average, a monthly utility bill for an 85 sqm apartment can range from $100 to $200 USD.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Utilities (85 sqm apt): ($150 USD)\nInternet (60 Mbps): ($25 USD/month)\nMobile Data (10GB): ($5 USD/month)\nElectricity Cost: ($0.15 per kWh)\nCurrency: KHR\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nThe utility infrastructure in Cambodia is generally well-developed, with most areas having access to electricity, water, and gas. However, the cost of utilities can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher demand during the hot summer months (March to May) and lower demand during the cooler winter months (December to February). The overall quality of the utility infrastructure is relatively stable, with minimal disruptions to services. The Cambodian government has also implemented measures to reduce the cost of utilities, such as subsidies for low-income households and incentives for energy-efficient practices.\n\nThe cost of utilities in Cambodia is also influenced by the country's economic growth and inflation rate. With a GDP per capita PPP of $7,967 (2024) and an inflation rate of 0.8% (2024), the cost of utilities is relatively stable. However, the out-of-pocket health spend of 60.6% (2023) and education spend of 2.2% (2023) of GDP may indicate that households have to allocate a significant portion of their income towards essential services, including utilities.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $30 | $50 | $70 | |\n| Water | $10 | $15 | $20 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $5 | $10 | $15 | |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $5 | $10 | $15 | (if separate) |\n| **Total** | **$50** | **$85** | **$120** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $15-25 | 10-30 Mbps | Ezecom, Online, Metfone |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $30-50 | 60-100 Mbps | Ezecom, Online, Metfone |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $3-5 | 1-10 GB | Cellcard, Smart, Metfone |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $10-20 | 10-50 GB | Cellcard, Smart, Metfone |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $20-50 | varies | Ezecom, Online, Metfone |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $8 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (if applicable) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities, it is recommended to contact the local provider and provide proof of address and identification.\n- Prepaid electricity meters are available, but postpaid plans may offer more flexibility and convenience.\n- The best internet providers in Cambodia include Ezecom, Online, and Metfone, which offer a range of plans and speeds.\n- To save on utility bills, households can implement energy-efficient practices, such as using LED light bulbs and turning off appliances when not in use.\n- It is also recommended to negotiate with providers for the best rates and plans, especially for long-term contracts.",
