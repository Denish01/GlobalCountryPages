[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Cambodia is located in Southeast Asia, bordered by Thailand to the west, Laos to the north, and Vietnam to the east. The country has a coastline along the Gulf of Thailand to the southwest, providing access to the sea. Cambodia's strategic location allows for easy trade and cultural exchange with its neighboring countries. The country's borders are relatively stable, with some minor disputes with neighboring countries over territorial claims.

The country's geography is characterized by a mix of low-lying plains, mountains, and coastal regions. The **Mekong River**, which flows through the country from north to south, plays a crucial role in shaping Cambodia's landscape and providing a source of water and transportation for the population. The river also supports a rich array of aquatic life and helps to fertilize the surrounding land, making it suitable for agriculture. Cambodia's location in the tropics means that it experiences a warm and humid climate year-round, with two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Cambodia's terrain is varied, with several distinct regions. The **Tonle Sap Lake**, located in the northwest, is the largest freshwater lake in Southeast Asia and is an important source of fish and other aquatic resources. The lake is surrounded by a fertile plain, which is home to a significant portion of the country's population. The **Cardamom Mountains**, located in the southwest, are a rugged and densely forested range that covers much of the country. The mountains are home to a wide range of wildlife, including elephants, tigers, and monkeys.

The **Mekong Delta**, which covers much of the eastern part of the country, is a low-lying region of rivers, canals, and wetlands. The delta is an important agricultural region, with rice, fish, and other crops being grown in the fertile soil. The **coastal region**, which borders the Gulf of Thailand, is a narrow strip of land that is home to several popular beach resorts and fishing villages. The coastal region is also home to several important ports, including the port of Sihanoukville, which is a major hub for international trade.

The country's landscape is also dotted with numerous **temples and ruins**, which are a testament to Cambodia's rich cultural heritage. The most famous of these is **Angkor Wat**, a massive temple complex located near the town of Siem Reap. Angkor Wat is one of the largest and most impressive temple complexes in the world and is a major tourist destination.
