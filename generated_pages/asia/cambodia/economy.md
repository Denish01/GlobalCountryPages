[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Cambodia is a Lower-Middle income economy with a growing GDP. The country has made significant progress in recent years, with the economy experiencing an average annual growth rate of 7%. This growth is driven by a combination of factors, including a rapidly expanding tourism sector, a growing manufacturing industry, and a thriving agricultural sector. Despite this growth, Cambodia still faces significant development challenges, including a lack of infrastructure and a reliance on a few key industries.

Cambodia's economy is primarily driven by the private sector, with a growing number of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) playing an increasingly important role. The government has implemented a number of policies aimed at promoting economic growth and development, including the creation of special economic zones (SEZs) and the introduction of tax incentives for foreign investors. However, the economy remains vulnerable to external shocks, including fluctuations in global commodity prices and changes in international trade policies.

The Cambodian government has set a number of ambitious targets for economic development, including a goal of becoming an upper-middle income country by 2030. To achieve this goal, the government will need to implement a range of policies aimed at promoting economic diversification, improving the business environment, and increasing investment in key sectors such as education and infrastructure.
