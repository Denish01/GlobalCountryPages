[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The Cambodian property market has experienced significant growth in recent years, driven by the country's rapid economic development and increasing foreign investment. The market is characterized by a mix of modern high-rise buildings, colonial-era villas, and traditional Khmer houses. Prices have been rising steadily, particularly in the capital city of Phnom Penh, where demand for housing and commercial space is high. However, the market is still relatively affordable compared to other major cities in Southeast Asia. Urban areas tend to be more expensive than rural areas, but the latter are becoming increasingly attractive to investors and tourists alike.

The current market conditions are favorable for buyers, with a wide range of properties available, from luxury apartments to affordable housing. The price trajectory is expected to continue upward, driven by the country's growing economy and increasing demand for housing. However, the market is not without its risks, and buyers should be aware of the potential for **market fluctuations** and **regulatory changes**. The urban property market is more developed, with a wider range of amenities and services available, while the rural market is more traditional and less developed.

These initiatives are expected to drive growth and investment in the market, particularly in the urban areas.
