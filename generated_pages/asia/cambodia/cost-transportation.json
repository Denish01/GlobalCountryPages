The quality of public transit in Cambodia is relatively good, with many cities having a comprehensive network of buses and taxis. However, the traffic in major cities like Phnom Penh and Siem Reap can be chaotic, and road conditions in rural areas can be poor. Most people in Cambodia get around using motorcycles or bicycles, which are affordable and convenient for short distances. For longer distances, buses and taxis are popular options, while ride-hailing services are becoming increasingly popular in major cities.\n\nThe transportation network in Cambodia is also influenced by the country's geography, with the Mekong River playing a significant role in the transportation of goods and people. The river is an important transportation route, with many boats and ferries operating along its length. In addition, the country's road network is being improved, with many new roads and highways being built to connect major cities and towns. However, despite these improvements, traffic congestion and road safety remain significant concerns in Cambodia.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.50-1.00 | $10-20 | Good coverage in Phnom Penh and Siem Reap |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $1-2 | N/A | Limited routes, but a cheap option |\n| Commuter Train | $2-5 | $20-50 | Limited routes, but a convenient option for longer distances |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $1-2 | $0.50-1.00 | $5-10 | Available in major cities |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $1-2 | $0.50-1.00 | $5-10 | Grab and PassApp are popular options |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $10-20 | To city center, depending on traffic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $0.80-1.00 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $0.70-0.90 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $20-50 | Economy car, depending on the rental company |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-2 | Limited parking options in major cities |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $2-5 | Limited toll roads, but fees apply on some highways |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-20 | Phnom Penh to Siem Reap, for example |\n| Domestic Flight | $50-100 | Phnom Penh to Siem Reap, for example |\n| Train (long-distance) | $10-20 | Limited routes, but a scenic option |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Use reputable taxi companies or ride-hailing services to ensure safety and avoid scams.\n- Negotiate the fare before you start your journey, especially when using taxis or tuk-tuks.\n- Consider buying a local SIM card to use ride-hailing apps and stay connected.\n- Be aware of traffic rules and regulations, especially when driving or riding a motorcycle.\n- Use **Grab** or **PassApp** for convenient and affordable ride-hailing services.\n- Always wear a helmet when driving or riding a motorcycle, and consider wearing protective gear.",
