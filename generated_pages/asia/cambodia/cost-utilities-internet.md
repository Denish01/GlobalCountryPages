[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
The utility infrastructure in Cambodia is generally well-developed, with most areas having access to electricity, water, and gas. However, the cost of utilities can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher demand during the hot summer months (March to May) and lower demand during the cooler winter months (December to February). The overall quality of the utility infrastructure is relatively stable, with minimal disruptions to services. The Cambodian government has also implemented measures to reduce the cost of utilities, such as subsidies for low-income households and incentives for energy-efficient practices.

The cost of utilities in Cambodia is also influenced by the country's economic growth and inflation rate. With a GDP per capita PPP of $7,967 (2024) and an inflation rate of 0.8% (2024), the cost of utilities is relatively stable. However, the out-of-pocket health spend of 60.6% (2023) and education spend of 2.2% (2023) of GDP may indicate that households have to allocate a significant portion of their income towards essential services, including utilities.
