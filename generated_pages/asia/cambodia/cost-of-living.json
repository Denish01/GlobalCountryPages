[/SECTION]\nCambodia is considered an affordable country to live in or visit, with a cost of living that is lower than many of its neighbors in Southeast Asia. The country's economy is growing rapidly, but the cost of goods and services remains relatively low, making it an attractive destination for tourists and expats alike. Compared to Thailand and Vietnam, Cambodia's prices are generally lower, although they can be higher than those in Laos. Overall, Cambodia offers a great balance of affordability and quality of life, making it an excellent choice for travelers and expats looking for a budget-friendly destination.\n\nCambodia's affordability is due in part to its relatively low cost of accommodation, food, and transportation. The country's capital, Phnom Penh, is a bustling city with a wide range of accommodation options, from budget-friendly guesthouses to luxury hotels. Outside of the cities, the cost of living can be even lower, with many rural areas offering a very low cost of living.
