The country's cultural identity is deeply rooted in its **Khmer** heritage, which dates back to the ancient Khmer Empire. The Khmer people make up the majority of the population, with around 90% of the country's 17 million people identifying as Khmer. The official language is **Khmer**, which is spoken by the vast majority of the population. Cambodia's cultural identity has also been shaped by its location in Southeast Asia, with influences from **Theravada Buddhism**, which is the dominant religion in the country.\n\nCambodia's cultural makeup is also influenced by its history of French colonization, which has left a lasting legacy in the country's architecture, cuisine, and language. Many Cambodians speak some French, and the country's capital, Phnom Penh, is known for its French colonial architecture. The country's cultural identity has also been shaped by its neighbors, including **Thailand** and **Vietnam**, which have had a significant impact on the country's cuisine, music, and art. Despite its complex history and cultural influences, Cambodia has a strong sense of national identity and a deep pride in its cultural heritage.\n\nThe ethnic makeup of Cambodia is relatively homogeneous, with the Khmer people making up the majority of the population.
