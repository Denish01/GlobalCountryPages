[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Cambodia has a well-developed transportation network, with various modes of transport available, including buses, taxis, ride-hailing services, and bicycles. The quality of public transit in Cambodia is relatively good, with many cities having a comprehensive network of buses and taxis. However, the traffic in major cities like Phnom Penh and Siem Reap can be chaotic, and road conditions in rural areas can be poor. Most people in Cambodia get around using motorcycles or bicycles, which are affordable and convenient for short distances. For longer distances, buses and taxis are popular options, while ride-hailing services are becoming increasingly popular in major cities.

The transportation network in Cambodia is also influenced by the country's geography, with the Mekong River playing a significant role in the transportation of goods and people. The river is an important transportation route, with many boats and ferries operating along its length. In addition, the country's road network is being improved, with many new roads and highways being built to connect major cities and towns. However, despite these improvements, traffic congestion and road safety remain significant concerns in Cambodia.
