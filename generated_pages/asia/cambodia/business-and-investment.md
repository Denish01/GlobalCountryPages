[SECTION] Business Environment [/SECTION]
Cambodia has made significant progress in recent years to improve its business environment, with the government implementing various reforms to attract foreign investment. The country's strategic location in the heart of Southeast Asia, with access to major markets such as China, Japan, and the European Union, makes it an attractive destination for investors. However, the bureaucracy level is still relatively high, and corruption remains a significant issue. The government has established the Council for the Development of Cambodia (CDC) to oversee investment and development, and it has introduced various incentives to attract foreign investors.

The business climate in Cambodia is generally favorable, with a growing economy and a young, low-cost workforce. The country has also made significant progress in terms of trade facilitation, with the implementation of the **ASEAN Single Window** and the **WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement**. However, the lack of transparency and accountability in some government institutions, as well as the limited availability of skilled labor, can still pose challenges for investors.

Despite these challenges, the government's attitude towards foreign investment is generally positive, with a focus on attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) to drive economic growth and development. The government has established a number of **special economic zones** (SEZs) and industrial parks, which offer various incentives and benefits to investors, including tax exemptions, duty-free imports, and streamlined regulatory procedures.
