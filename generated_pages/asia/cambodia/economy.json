The country has made significant progress in recent years, with the economy experiencing an average annual growth rate of 7%. This growth is driven by a combination of factors, including a rapidly expanding tourism sector, a growing manufacturing industry, and a thriving agricultural sector. Despite this growth, Cambodia still faces significant development challenges, including a lack of infrastructure and a reliance on a few key industries.\n\nCambodia's economy is primarily driven by the private sector, with a growing number of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) playing an increasingly important role. The government has implemented a number of policies aimed at promoting economic growth and development, including the creation of special economic zones (SEZs) and the introduction of tax incentives for foreign investors. However, the economy remains vulnerable to external shocks, including fluctuations in global commodity prices and changes in international trade policies.\n\nThe Cambodian government has set a number of ambitious targets for economic development, including a goal of becoming an upper-middle income country by 2030. To achieve this goal, the government will need to implement a range of policies aimed at promoting economic diversification, improving the business environment, and increasing investment in key sectors such as education and infrastructure.\n\n[SECTION] Key Industries [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Industry | Contribution | Details |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Textiles | 40% of total exports | Cambodia's textile industry is one of the country's most important sectors, with a large number of garment factories operating in the country |\n| Tourism | 10% of GDP | The tourism sector is a rapidly growing industry in Cambodia, with a large number of visitors drawn to the country's rich cultural heritage and natural beauty |\n| Agriculture | 25% of GDP | Agriculture is a significant sector in Cambodia, with the country producing a range of crops including rice, corn, and soybeans |\n| Manufacturing | 15% of GDP | The manufacturing sector is a growing industry in Cambodia, with a number of foreign companies operating in the country |\n| Services | 30% of GDP | The services sector is a significant contributor to Cambodia's economy, with a range of industries including finance, telecommunications, and hospitality |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Trade Profile [/SECTION]\n**Top Exports:** \n- Textiles and garments\n- Footwear\n- Agricultural products (including rice and corn)\n- Rubber\n- Timber products\nThese exports are primarily destined for countries such as the United States, the European Union, and Japan.\n\n**Top Imports:** \n- Petroleum products\n- Machinery and equipment\n- Vehicles\n- Electronics\n- Pharmaceuticals\nThese imports are primarily sourced from countries such as China, Thailand, and Vietnam.\n\n**Key Trading Partners:** \n- China\n- Thailand\n- Vietnam\n- United States\n- European Union\nThese countries are Cambodia's most important trading partners, with the country relying heavily on foreign trade to drive economic growth.\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n- The country has a relatively underdeveloped transport network, with a limited number of paved roads and a lack of rail connections.\n- Energy production is primarily based on fossil fuels, with a growing number of renewable energy projects being developed.\n- Internet and mobile penetration is relatively high, with a large number of Cambodians using mobile phones and having access to the internet.\n- The country has a number of ports, including the deep-water port at Sihanoukville, which is an important hub for international trade.\n- There are three international airports in Cambodia, including Phnom Penh International Airport, Siem Reap International Airport, and Sihanoukville International Airport.\n\n[SECTION] Economic Outlook [/SECTION]\nThe outlook for Cambodia's economy is generally positive, with the country expected to continue experiencing rapid economic growth in the coming years.
