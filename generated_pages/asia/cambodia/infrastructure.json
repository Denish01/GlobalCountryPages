  "content": "Cambodia's infrastructure is still developing, with significant investments in recent years aimed at improving the country's roads, power generation, and telecommunications, but challenges persist, particularly in rural areas.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 71% of population\nInternet Penetration: 48%\nRoad Network: 38,257 km, mostly paved but with varying quality\nRail Network: 612 km\nMajor Airports: 3\nMajor Ports: 2\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nCambodia's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other countries in the region, but the government has made significant efforts to improve the situation in recent years. The country has invested heavily in building new roads, expanding its power generation capacity, and improving its telecommunications network. However, a significant urban-rural gap remains, with many rural areas lacking access to basic infrastructure such as electricity, clean water, and sanitation. The government has also implemented policies to attract foreign investment and encourage private sector participation in infrastructure development.\n\nDespite these efforts, Cambodia still faces significant infrastructure challenges, including a lack of reliable and efficient public transportation, limited access to clean water and sanitation, and frequent power outages. The country is also vulnerable to natural disasters such as floods and droughts, which can have a significant impact on its infrastructure. To address these challenges, the government has developed a comprehensive infrastructure development plan, which includes investments in roads, bridges, and other critical infrastructure.\n\nThe plan also includes measures to improve the country's disaster resilience and response capabilities, such as the construction of flood-resistant roads and bridges. Additionally, the government has established a number of special economic zones to attract foreign investment and promote economic growth. These zones are equipped with modern infrastructure, including reliable power supply, clean water, and sanitation, as well as advanced telecommunications networks.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 38,257 km | Moderate | Mostly paved, but with varying quality and limited rural access |\n| Railways | 612 km | Poor | Limited network and frequent disruptions |\n| Airports | 3 international, 10 domestic | Good | Modern facilities, but limited connectivity to rural areas |\n| Ports | 2 major | Moderate | Limited capacity and efficiency, but strategic location |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- The majority of Cambodia's power generation comes from **imported fossil fuels**, with a growing share of **renewable energy sources** such as hydro and solar power.\n- The country's power grid is still underdeveloped, with frequent **power outages** and **blackouts** in rural areas.\n- The government has set a target of increasing the share of **renewable energy** in the energy mix to 20% by 2025.\n- Cambodia has also invested in **energy efficiency** measures, such as the use of LED lighting and energy-efficient appliances.\n- The country is also exploring **regional energy cooperation** with neighboring countries to improve energy security and reduce reliance on imported fuels.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water safety** is a significant concern in Cambodia, with many urban and rural areas lacking access to clean and safe drinking water.\n- **Sanitation coverage** is also limited, with many households relying on **traditional latrines** or **open defecation**.\n- The government has implemented **water sector reforms** aimed at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of water supply services.\n- **Rural water access** remains a significant challenge, with many communities relying on **rainwater harvesting** or **traditional water sources**.\n- **Wastewater management** is also a concern, with many urban areas lacking adequate **sewerage systems** and **wastewater treatment** facilities.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is widespread in Cambodia, with all major operators offering **4G** and **3G** services.\n- **Fiber-optic connectivity** is also available in major urban areas, with **broadband** services offered by several providers.\n- The government has implemented **ICT sector development** policies aimed at promoting the use of **information and communication technologies**.\n- **Postal services** are also available, with **Cambodia Post** offering a range of services including **mail delivery** and **parcel services**.\n- **Internet penetration** is growing rapidly, with **online services** such as **e-commerce** and **online banking** becoming increasingly popular.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The **Cambodia-China Expressway** project aims to improve road connectivity between Phnom Penh and the border with China.\n- The **Cambodia-Vietnam Railway** project aims to restore the rail link between the two countries and improve regional connectivity.\n- The **Lower Sesan 2 Dam** project aims to increase **hydroelectric power** generation and improve energy security.\n- The **Phnom Penh Water Supply** project aims to improve **water treatment** and **distribution** services in the capital city.\n- The **Cambodia ICT Master Plan** aims to promote the development of the **ICT sector** and improve **digital literacy** among the population.",
