Cambodia is generally a safe country to visit, with low levels of violent crime. However, petty crimes such as pickpocketing, bag snatching, and scams are common, particularly in tourist areas. The country has made significant progress in recent years in terms of security, but visitors should still exercise caution, especially when traveling at night or in crowded areas. With some basic precautions and an understanding of the local culture, visitors can have a safe and enjoyable experience in Cambodia.

As with any country, there are areas that are considered safer than others.

The country's roads can be hazardous, especially for motorcyclists, and visitors should exercise extreme caution when driving or crossing the road. Additionally, Cambodia is prone to natural disasters such as floods and droughts, which can affect travel plans and safety.
