[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Cambodia is relatively affordable, with a wide range of options available for expats and locals alike. Typical lease terms are one year, with a deposit requirement of one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are generally well-protected, with the **Cambodian Land Law** regulating the relationship between landlords and tenants. Compared to its regional neighbors, Cambodia's housing costs are relatively low, making it an attractive option for those looking to relocate to Southeast Asia. However, the market is subject to fluctuations, and prices can vary depending on the location, with Phnom Penh being the most expensive city in the country.

The housing market in Cambodia is also influenced by the country's growing economy, with an increasing number of foreigners and locals investing in real estate. This has led to a surge in new developments, particularly in Phnom Penh, with many modern apartments and condominiums being built to cater to the growing demand. Despite this, the market remains relatively affordable, with many options available for those on a budget. Additionally, the **Cambodian government** has implemented various initiatives to promote affordable housing, including subsidies for low-income families and incentives for developers to build affordable housing units.
