  "content": "Cambodia is generally cheaper than Vietnam, with an overall cost of living that is around 15-20% lower.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nCambodia GDP per Capita (PPP): $4,145\nVietnam GDP per Capita (PPP): $8,066\nCambodia Inflation Rate: 3.5%\nVietnam Inflation Rate: 3.2%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Cambodia\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Cambodia vs Vietnam [/SECTION]\nCambodia and Vietnam are two neighboring countries in Southeast Asia that offer a unique blend of culture, history, and natural beauty. In terms of cost of living, Cambodia is generally considered to be the more affordable option, with lower prices for accommodation, food, and transportation. This is largely due to the fact that Cambodia is a less developed country than Vietnam, with a lower GDP per capita and a smaller economy. However, Vietnam has been experiencing rapid economic growth in recent years, which has led to an increase in prices, particularly in major cities like Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries is also worth considering. Cambodia has a relatively small economy, with a strong focus on agriculture and textiles, while Vietnam has a more diversified economy, with a growing manufacturing sector and a strong tourism industry. This has led to an increase in prices in Vietnam, particularly for accommodation and transportation. However, Cambodia's lower cost of living and more relaxed pace of life make it an attractive option for expats, digital nomads, and travelers looking for a affordable and laid-back lifestyle. According to various sources, the overall cost of living in Cambodia is around 15-20% lower than in Vietnam, making it a more affordable option for those looking to live and travel in Southeast Asia.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cambodia (USD) | Vietnam (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | $250 | $350 | 28% cheaper in Cambodia |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | $150 | $250 | 40% cheaper in Cambodia |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | $500 | $700 | 29% cheaper in Cambodia |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cambodia (USD) | Vietnam (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | $3 | $5 | 40% cheaper in Cambodia |\n| Groceries (monthly) | $100 | $150 | 33% cheaper in Cambodia |\n| Beer (500ml) | $1 | $2 | 50% cheaper in Cambodia |\n| Coffee | $1 | $2 | 50% cheaper in Cambodia |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cambodia (USD) | Vietnam (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | $10 | $20 | 50% cheaper in Cambodia |\n| Taxi (per km) | $0.50 | $0.75 | 33% cheaper in Cambodia |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $0.80 | $1.00 | 20% cheaper in Cambodia |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cambodia (USD) | Vietnam (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | $50 | $75 | 33% cheaper in Cambodia |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | $20 | $30 | 33% cheaper in Cambodia |\n| Mobile Plan | $5 | $10 | 50% cheaper in Cambodia |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Cambodia (USD) | Vietnam (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | $400 | $600 | 33% cheaper in Cambodia |\n| Mid-Range | $800 | $1,200 | 33% cheaper in Cambodia |\n| Comfortable | $1,200 | $1,800 | 33% cheaper in Cambodia |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Cambodia is cheaper for:**\n  - Rent and accommodation, with prices that are around 20-30% lower than in Vietnam\n  - Food and dining, with meals and groceries that are around 30-40% cheaper than in Vietnam\n  - Transportation, with taxi fares and fuel prices that are around 20-30% lower than in Vietnam\n  - Utilities and internet, with prices that are around 20-30% cheaper than in Vietnam\n- **Vietnam is cheaper for:**\n  - Certain types of clothing and electronics, which can be found at lower prices in Vietnam's larger markets and shopping malls\n  - Some types of tourist activities and attractions, which can be more affordable in Vietnam due to the country's more developed tourism industry\n  - Certain types of healthcare and medical services, which can be more advanced and affordable in Vietnam\n  - Some types of educational programs and courses, which can be more affordable and widely available in Vietnam\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nWhen it comes to choosing between Cambodia and Vietnam, the decision ultimately depends on your individual lifestyle and priorities.
