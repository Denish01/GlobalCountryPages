[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Cambodia's population has been steadily increasing over the years, with an estimated growth rate of 1.4% per annum. The country's population size is relatively small compared to its neighbors, but its growth rate is higher than the average in Southeast Asia. The urban population accounts for approximately 24.6% of the total population, with the majority residing in rural areas. Phnom Penh, the capital city, is the most populous urban center, with a population of over 2 million people. Cambodia's population is also characterized by a high proportion of young people, with approximately 30% of the population under the age of 15.

The population growth trend in Cambodia is influenced by factors such as fertility rates, mortality rates, and migration patterns. The total fertility rate has been declining over the years, from 4.5 children per woman in 2000 to 2.7 children per woman in 2020. The life expectancy at birth has also increased, from 58 years in 2000 to 68.7 years in 2020. However, the country still faces challenges related to healthcare, education, and economic development, which can impact population growth and development.

Cambodia's population is also influenced by migration patterns, both within the country and across borders. Many Cambodians migrate to neighboring countries, such as Thailand and Vietnam, in search of employment opportunities. Additionally, there are significant numbers of Cambodians living abroad, particularly in the United States, France, and Australia, who contribute to the country's economy through remittances.
