The education system in Cambodia is overseen by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport, and is divided into primary, secondary, and higher education. Public schools are generally free or low-cost, but the quality of education can vary greatly depending on the location and resources available. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a higher quality of education, but at a significantly higher cost. The language of instruction in public schools is **Khmer**, while private and international schools often teach in **English** or other foreign languages. Compulsory education in Cambodia lasts for 12 years, from age 6 to 18.

International schools are available in major cities like Phnom Penh and Siem Reap, offering a range of curricula, including **International Baccalaureate**, **Cambridge International Examinations**, and **American** and **British** curricula. These schools cater to expatriate families and wealthy locals, and offer a high-quality education, but at a premium price. The quality of education in Cambodia is generally considered to be lower than in other countries in the region, but there are efforts being made to improve the system, particularly in the areas of teacher training and curriculum development.
