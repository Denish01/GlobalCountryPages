  "content": "Healthcare in Cambodia is a mixed system that has undergone significant improvements in recent years, but still faces challenges, particularly in rural areas, where access to quality medical care can be limited.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nQuality Rating: Good\nEmergency Number: 119\nHospital Standard: Adequate\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: widespread\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nCambodia's healthcare system is a mix of public and private providers, with a growing number of private hospitals and clinics, especially in urban areas like Phnom Penh. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, leading to a reliance on private providers for many Cambodians. The quality of care varies significantly between urban and rural areas, with better-equipped and staffed facilities in cities. Despite these challenges, Cambodia has made significant progress in improving healthcare outcomes, including reducing mortality rates and increasing access to healthcare services.\n\nThe Cambodian government has implemented various initiatives to improve the healthcare system, including the introduction of a national health insurance scheme and the expansion of healthcare services to rural areas. However, more work is needed to address the significant disparities in healthcare access and quality between urban and rural areas. The private sector plays a significant role in Cambodia's healthcare system, with many private hospitals and clinics offering high-quality care, often with international standards and English-speaking staff.\n\nCambodia's healthcare system also faces challenges related to **disease prevention** and **health promotion**, with a high burden of infectious diseases like HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria. The country has made progress in reducing the incidence of these diseases, but more work is needed to address the underlying social and economic determinants of health. The government has implemented various programs to promote health and prevent disease, including **vaccination campaigns** and **health education programs**.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Royal Phnom Penh Hospital | Phnom Penh | Private | General medicine, surgery, pediatrics | Yes |\n| Calmette Hospital | Phnom Penh | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Limited |\n| Khmer-Soviet Friendship Hospital | Phnom Penh | Public | General medicine, surgery, orthopedics | Limited |\n| International SOS Medical Center | Phnom Penh | Private | Emergency medicine, general practice, specialist care | Yes |\n| Siem Reap Referral Hospital | Siem Reap | Public | General medicine, surgery, pediatrics | Limited |\n| Angkor Hospital for Children | Siem Reap | Non-profit | Pediatrics, emergency medicine, surgery | Yes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Expatriate health insurance** is highly recommended for foreigners living in Cambodia, as it provides access to better-quality medical care and evacuation services if needed.\n- Local insurance options are available, but may not provide the same level of coverage as international insurance plans.\n- **Travel insurance** is also recommended for visitors to Cambodia, as it can provide emergency medical evacuation and other benefits.\n- Many private hospitals and clinics in Cambodia accept international insurance plans, but it's essential to check with your provider before seeking care.\n- The cost of health insurance in Cambodia varies depending on the provider and level of coverage, but expect to pay around $500-1000 per year for a basic plan.\n- Some employers in Cambodia offer health insurance as part of their benefits package, so it's worth checking with your employer to see what options are available.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Pharmacies** are widespread in urban areas, with many offering a wide range of medications, including prescription and over-the-counter drugs.\n- Prescription requirements vary depending on the medication, but many pharmacies will dispense medication without a prescription.\n- Common brands of medication are available in Cambodia, including international brands like **GlaxoSmithKline** and **Pfizer**.\n- The cost of medications in Cambodia is generally lower than in Western countries, but can still be expensive for some specialty medications.\n- It's essential to check the expiration dates and packaging of medications before purchasing, as counterfeit medications can be a problem in Cambodia.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Hepatitis A** and **typhoid** vaccinations are recommended for all travelers to Cambodia.\n- **Rabies** vaccination is also recommended, especially for those who will be spending time around animals.\n- **Malaria** is a risk in some areas of Cambodia, particularly in rural areas, so **malaria prophylaxis** may be necessary.\n- **Dengue fever** and **chikungunya** are also present in Cambodia, so take precautions against **mosquito-borne illnesses**.\n- **Water-borne illnesses** like **diarrhea** and **giardiasis** can be a risk, especially for those drinking untreated water or eating undercooked food.\n- **Food safety** is also a concern, so make sure to eat at reputable restaurants and avoid undercooked meat and seafood.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **Dental care** is a popular medical tourism option in Cambodia, with many clinics offering high-quality care at lower costs than in Western countries.\n- **Cosmetic surgery** is also available in Cambodia, with some clinics offering procedures like **facelifts** and **breast augmentations**.\n- **Orthopedic surgery** is another area where Cambodia is becoming a popular medical tourism destination, with some clinics offering **joint replacement** and **spinal surgery**.\n- The cost savings for medical tourism in Cambodia can be significant, with some procedures costing 50-75% less than in Western countries.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- In the event of a medical emergency, call **119** for an ambulance or go to the nearest hospital.\n- Many private hospitals and clinics have their own emergency services, so it's a good idea to keep their contact information handy.\n- If you need to be evacuated to another country for medical care, **International SOS** and other emergency evacuation services are available.\n- Make sure to have a copy of your insurance documents and any relevant medical records with you at all times.\n- In the event of a medical emergency, try to stay calm and follow the instructions of local medical professionals.",
