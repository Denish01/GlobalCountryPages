[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Cambodia's healthcare system is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. Public healthcare is generally more affordable, but the quality can vary greatly depending on the location and facility. In rural areas, public healthcare facilities may be understaffed and under-resourced, while in urban areas like Phnom Penh, the quality of public healthcare is generally better. For foreigners, private healthcare is often the preferred option, as it offers better facilities, more English-speaking staff, and a wider range of services. However, private healthcare can be expensive, and it is recommended that foreigners have health insurance to cover the costs.

The healthcare system in Cambodia is also affected by the country's limited resources and infrastructure. Many public healthcare facilities lack modern equipment and trained staff, which can make it difficult to access quality care. Additionally, the country's healthcare system is often overwhelmed by the demand for services, particularly in urban areas. Despite these challenges, the Cambodian government has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, including increasing funding for public healthcare and implementing programs to improve access to healthcare for rural communities.
