# Best Time to Visit Cambodia — Month-by-Month Guide

The best time to visit Cambodia is from November to March, when the weather is dry and comfortable, making it ideal for exploring the country's temples, cities, and countryside.

[CALLOUT] Best months to visit Cambodia: November to March. Peak season: December to February. Budget season: May to June. Avoid: April and May due to the hot weather, and September to November due to the heavy rainfall. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Cambodia has a tropical climate with two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from November to March, is characterized by low humidity and comfortable temperatures, making it the best time to visit the country. The wet season, which runs from April to October, is marked by heavy rainfall and high humidity, making travel more challenging. The country can be divided into two climate zones: the low-lying plains and the mountainous regions. The low-lying plains, where most of the population lives, experience a hot and humid climate, while the mountainous regions are cooler and more temperate.

The dry season is the best time to visit Cambodia's famous temples, such as **Angkor Wat**, as the weather is dry and comfortable, making it ideal for exploring the temples and the surrounding countryside. The wet season, on the other hand, can make travel more difficult, as some roads may be flooded and the heat and humidity can be oppressive. However, the wet season also has its advantages, as the countryside is lush and green, and the waterfalls are at their peak.

The seasons also affect the prices of accommodations and tourist services, with the peak season being the most expensive time to visit. The budget season, which runs from May to June, is a good time to visit if you're on a tight budget, as prices are lower and the weather is still relatively dry.
