[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Cambodia's healthcare system is a mix of public and private providers, with a growing number of private hospitals and clinics, especially in urban areas like Phnom Penh. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, leading to a reliance on private providers for many Cambodians. The quality of care varies significantly between urban and rural areas, with better-equipped and staffed facilities in cities. Despite these challenges, Cambodia has made significant progress in improving healthcare outcomes, including reducing mortality rates and increasing access to healthcare services.

The Cambodian government has implemented various initiatives to improve the healthcare system, including the introduction of a national health insurance scheme and the expansion of healthcare services to rural areas. However, more work is needed to address the significant disparities in healthcare access and quality between urban and rural areas. The private sector plays a significant role in Cambodia's healthcare system, with many private hospitals and clinics offering high-quality care, often with international standards and English-speaking staff.

Cambodia's healthcare system also faces challenges related to **disease prevention** and **health promotion**, with a high burden of infectious diseases like HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria. The country has made progress in reducing the incidence of these diseases, but more work is needed to address the underlying social and economic determinants of health. The government has implemented various programs to promote health and prevent disease, including **vaccination campaigns** and **health education programs**.
