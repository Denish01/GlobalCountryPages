[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Cambodia is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **executive branch** is headed by the prime minister, who is responsible for appointing ministers and overseeing the administration of the government. The **legislative branch** is composed of the National Assembly, which is a unicameral body with 123 seats. The National Assembly is responsible for making laws and approving the budget. The **judicial branch** is composed of the Supreme Court and lower courts, which are responsible for interpreting the law and resolving disputes. Cambodia has a **unitary system**, where the central government has significant control over the provinces and municipalities.

The government of Cambodia is also influenced by the **monarchy**, which plays a ceremonial role in the country. The king serves as the head of state, but has limited powers and is primarily responsible for promoting national unity and stability. The prime minister and the National Assembly have more significant powers and are responsible for making key decisions about the country's governance.

The **separation of powers** in Cambodia is not always clear-cut, and there have been concerns about the concentration of power in the executive branch. The government has been criticized for limiting the independence of the judiciary and restricting the freedom of the press and civil society.
