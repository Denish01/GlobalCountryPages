[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]
The linguistic landscape of Cambodia is dominated by the **Khmer language**, which is spoken by the vast majority of the population. There are several regional dialects, including the **Phnom Penh dialect**, which is considered the standard dialect, and the **Battambang dialect**, which is spoken in the northwest. Minority languages, such as **Vietnamese** and **Cham**, are also spoken by smaller communities. English is becoming increasingly popular, particularly among younger Cambodians, but it is still not widely spoken, especially outside of major tourist areas. As a result, visitors may encounter some language barriers, but learning a few basic Khmer phrases can go a long way in enhancing their travel experience.

Khmer is a **tonal language**, which means that the same word can have different meanings based on the tone in which it is pronounced. This can make it challenging for non-native speakers to learn, but with practice, it is possible to master the basics. In addition to Khmer, many Cambodians also speak **French**, which was the language of the colonial era, and **English**, which is becoming increasingly popular as a second language.

Despite the growing popularity of English, it is still not widely understood, especially outside of major tourist areas. As a result, visitors may need to rely on **gestures** and **body language** to communicate, particularly with older Cambodians who may not speak English. However, many younger Cambodians are eager to practice their English skills, and visitors may find that they are able to communicate more easily with them.
