[SECTION] Overview: Cambodia vs Vietnam [/SECTION]
Cambodia and Vietnam are two neighboring countries in Southeast Asia that offer a unique blend of culture, history, and natural beauty. In terms of cost of living, Cambodia is generally considered to be the more affordable option, with lower prices for accommodation, food, and transportation. This is largely due to the fact that Cambodia is a less developed country than Vietnam, with a lower GDP per capita and a smaller economy. However, Vietnam has been experiencing rapid economic growth in recent years, which has led to an increase in prices, particularly in major cities like Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.

The economic context of the two countries is also worth considering. Cambodia has a relatively small economy, with a strong focus on agriculture and textiles, while Vietnam has a more diversified economy, with a growing manufacturing sector and a strong tourism industry. This has led to an increase in prices in Vietnam, particularly for accommodation and transportation. However, Cambodia's lower cost of living and more relaxed pace of life make it an attractive option for expats, digital nomads, and travelers looking for a affordable and laid-back lifestyle. According to various sources, the overall cost of living in Cambodia is around 15-20% lower than in Vietnam, making it a more affordable option for those looking to live and travel in Southeast Asia.
