  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Cambodia can vary significantly depending on the type of care and location, with public healthcare generally being more affordable but varying in quality, while private healthcare is often more expensive but offers better facilities and services.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $115 (2023)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 60.6% (2023)\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 119\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: KHR\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nCambodia's healthcare system is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. Public healthcare is generally more affordable, but the quality can vary greatly depending on the location and facility. In rural areas, public healthcare facilities may be understaffed and under-resourced, while in urban areas like Phnom Penh, the quality of public healthcare is generally better. For foreigners, private healthcare is often the preferred option, as it offers better facilities, more English-speaking staff, and a wider range of services. However, private healthcare can be expensive, and it is recommended that foreigners have health insurance to cover the costs.\n\nThe healthcare system in Cambodia is also affected by the country's limited resources and infrastructure. Many public healthcare facilities lack modern equipment and trained staff, which can make it difficult to access quality care. Additionally, the country's healthcare system is often overwhelmed by the demand for services, particularly in urban areas. Despite these challenges, the Cambodian government has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, including increasing funding for public healthcare and implementing programs to improve access to healthcare for rural communities.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $5-10 | $20-50 | Public hospitals often have long wait times |\n| Specialist Consultation | $10-20 | $50-100 | Private hospitals offer more specialized care |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-20 | $30-50 | Many private dental clinics offer high-quality care |\n| Eye Exam | $10-20 | $20-30 | Private eye clinics often have modern equipment |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $5-10 | $10-20 | Public hospitals may not always have the latest equipment |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $20-50 | Private hospitals often have better emergency facilities |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $10-20 | Public hospitals may not always have private rooms |\n| Basic Surgery | $100-500 | Private hospitals often have more experienced surgeons |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $200-500 | Private hospitals often have better maternity facilities |\n| MRI Scan | $100-200 | Private hospitals may not always have the latest equipment |\n| X-Ray | $10-20 | Public hospitals often have basic X-ray facilities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $10-20 | Public hospital care, basic medical services |\n| Comprehensive Private | $50-100 | Private hospital care, specialized services, emergency evacuation |\n| International / Expat | $100-200 | Global coverage, emergency evacuation, high-end medical services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Common medications like **antibiotics** and **pain relievers** can cost between $5-10 per prescription\n- Prescription rules vary, but many medications are available over-the-counter\n- Pharmacies are widely available, particularly in urban areas\n- Many pharmacies offer a range of services, including **vaccinations** and **health checks**\n- Some pharmacies may not always have the latest or most effective medications\n- It is recommended to check the expiration dates and authenticity of medications before purchasing\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the emergency number 119 or go to the nearest hospital.
