[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Japan's housing market is highly competitive, particularly in urban areas like Tokyo and Osaka. The rental market is characterized by high demand and limited supply, leading to relatively high rents. Typical lease terms in Japan range from one to three years, with a two-month to three-month deposit requirement, known as **key money**, which is refundable when the tenant moves out. Tenant rights are generally well-protected in Japan, with laws governing rent increases, eviction procedures, and maintenance responsibilities. Compared to its regional neighbors, Japan's housing costs are among the highest, with prices in cities like Tokyo and Osaka surpassing those in Seoul and Beijing.

Japan's housing market is also influenced by cultural factors, such as the importance of **honne** (outside self) and **tatemae** (inside self), which can impact the way landlords and tenants interact. For example, landlords may prioritize building a positive relationship with their tenants over maximizing profits. Additionally, the concept of **wa** (harmony) can influence the way disputes are resolved, with a focus on finding mutually beneficial solutions. Overall, Japan's unique cultural context can make navigating the housing market challenging for foreigners, but also offers opportunities for building strong relationships with landlords and neighbors.
