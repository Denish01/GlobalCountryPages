[SECTION] How Japan Is Divided [/SECTION]
Japan is divided into 47 prefectures, which are the country's main administrative divisions. These prefectures are further divided into cities, towns, and villages. The prefectures are grouped into eight regions, each with its own unique character and identity. The regions are not strictly administrative divisions, but rather a way to group prefectures with similar geography, culture, and economy.

The administrative structure of Japan is a complex system, with a mix of national, prefectural, and local governments. The national government is responsible for overall policy and decision-making, while the prefectural governments have a degree of autonomy and are responsible for implementing national policies at the local level. The local governments, such as city and town councils, have limited powers but are responsible for providing local services and amenities.

[SECTION] Getting Around [/SECTION]
Japan has a well-developed transportation network, with a range of options for getting around. Domestic flights connect major cities, while trains, including the famous bullet train, provide a fast and efficient way to travel. Buses and taxis are also widely available, and driving is a viable option for those with a valid license. The road network is well-maintained, with many highways and expressways, but driving in urban areas can be challenging due to congestion and limited parking.

For visitors, the most convenient way to get around is often by train, with the Japan Rail Pass providing a cost-effective and flexible option for traveling on the country's extensive rail network. Many cities also have their own public transportation systems, including subways, buses, and trams, making it easy to get around without a car. [CALLOUT] Be sure to purchase a prepaid IC card, such as a Suica or Pasmo card, for convenient travel on public transportation.
