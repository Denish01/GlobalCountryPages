[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Japan's population size is significant, ranking it among the top ten most populous countries in the world. However, the country is experiencing a declining population growth rate, primarily due to a low fertility rate and an aging population. This trend is expected to continue, with the population projected to decrease to around 88 million by 2065. Urbanization is a dominant feature of Japan's population, with over 91% of the population living in urban areas, primarily in the Tokyo metropolitan area. Migration patterns in Japan are relatively low, with a small number of immigrants entering the country each year.

The population growth rate has significant implications for Japan's economy and society, as a shrinking workforce and aging population can lead to increased healthcare costs and a strain on the pension system. To address these challenges, the Japanese government has implemented policies aimed at increasing the fertility rate and encouraging immigration. Despite these efforts, the population is expected to continue declining, making it essential for the country to adapt to this new demographic reality.

Japan's urbanization trend is driven by the country's highly developed economy and high standard of living, which attracts people from rural areas to cities in search of better job opportunities and higher incomes. The Tokyo metropolitan area is the most populous urban agglomeration in the world, with over 38 million people living in the city and its surrounding areas. This has led to the development of a unique urban culture, with a blend of traditional and modern architecture, cuisine, and entertainment.
