[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
Japan's government is characterized by a **separation of powers** between the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. The **National Diet**, Japan's bicameral legislature, is composed of the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors. The House of Representatives has 465 members, elected by **proportional representation** for a four-year term, while the House of Councillors has 248 members, elected by a combination of single-member districts and proportional representation for a six-year term. The **Prime Minister**, who is the head of government, is appointed by the Emperor and is responsible for appointing the **Cabinet**, which is composed of ministers who oversee various government departments.

The Japanese government is also characterized by a **unitary system**, where the central government has significant authority over the country's 47 prefectures. While prefectures have some autonomy, the central government plays a major role in shaping policy and providing funding. Japan's **Constitution**, which was adopted in 1947, establishes the framework for the country's government and guarantees certain **fundamental rights**, such as freedom of speech and assembly.

The Japanese political system is also influenced by the concept of **consensus-building**, where decisions are often made through a process of negotiation and compromise between different interest groups and stakeholders. This approach has helped to maintain social cohesion and stability in Japan, but it can also lead to slow decision-making and a lack of bold policy initiatives.
