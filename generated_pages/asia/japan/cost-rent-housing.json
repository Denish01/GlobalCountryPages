The rental market is characterized by high demand and limited supply, leading to relatively high rents. Typical lease terms in Japan range from one to three years, with a two-month to three-month deposit requirement, known as **key money**, which is refundable when the tenant moves out. Tenant rights are generally well-protected in Japan, with laws governing rent increases, eviction procedures, and maintenance responsibilities. Compared to its regional neighbors, Japan's housing costs are among the highest, with prices in cities like Tokyo and Osaka surpassing those in Seoul and Beijing.\n\nJapan's housing market is also influenced by cultural factors, such as the importance of **honne** (outside self) and **tatemae** (inside self), which can impact the way landlords and tenants interact. For example, landlords may prioritize building a positive relationship with their tenants over maximizing profits. Additionally, the concept of **wa** (harmony) can influence the way disputes are resolved, with a focus on finding mutually beneficial solutions. Overall, Japan's unique cultural context can make navigating the housing market challenging for foreigners, but also offers opportunities for building strong relationships with landlords and neighbors.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $1,000-$1,800 | $600-$1,200 | compact, basic amenities |\n| 1 Bedroom | $1,200-$2,500 | $800-$1,800 | standard, medium-sized |\n| 2 Bedroom | $2,000-$4,000 | $1,200-$2,500 | family-sized, larger apartments |\n| 3 Bedroom | $2,500-$5,000 | $1,800-$3,500 | spacious, luxury amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $10,000-$20,000 | prime locations, high-rise buildings |\n| Suburbs | $5,000-$10,000 | residential areas, single-family homes |\n| Rural | $2,000-$5,000 | countryside, farmhouses or traditional homes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Roppongi**: a popular area for foreigners, with modern apartments and a vibrant nightlife, rents range from $1,500 to $3,000 USD per month (170,000 to 340,000 JPY)\n- **Shibuya**: a trendy neighborhood with a mix of old and new Tokyo, rents range from $1,200 to $2,500 USD per month (140,000 to 290,000 JPY)\n- **Azabu**: an upscale area with luxury apartments and a international community, rents range from $2,000 to $4,000 USD per month (230,000 to 450,000 JPY)\n- **Kichijoji**: a charming neighborhood with a small-town feel, rents range from $800 to $1,800 USD per month (90,000 to 200,000 JPY)\n- **Yokohama**: a city located just outside of Tokyo, with more affordable rents, ranging from $600 to $1,200 USD per month (70,000 to 140,000 JPY)\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Japan [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods thoroughly to find the best fit for your lifestyle and budget\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent to navigate the complex rental market\n- Be prepared to provide proof of income and employment to secure a rental agreement\n- **Key money** and **security deposits** are common, so factor these costs into your budget\n- Utilities, such as electricity and water, are usually not included in the rent, so plan for additional expenses\n- Furnished apartments are less common in Japan, so be prepared to purchase or rent furniture and appliances separately",
