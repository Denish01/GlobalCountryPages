The region is often further subdivided into three sub-regions: Tokai, Hokuriku, and Koshinetsu. The Tokai sub-region includes the prefectures of Aichi, Gifu, and Shizuoka, and is known for its urban areas and industrial centers. The Hokuriku sub-region includes the prefectures of Ishikawa, Fukui, and Toyama, and is known for its coastal cities and natural beauty. The Koshinetsu sub-region includes the prefectures of Nagano, Niigata, and Yamanashi, and is known for its mountainous terrain and natural hot springs.\n\nThe administrative structure of Chubu is complex, with each prefecture having its own government and administrative powers. However, the region as a whole is not a single administrative entity, and is instead a collection of prefectures that are linked by geography and economy. This structure allows for a great deal of autonomy and flexibility, but can also make it difficult to coordinate regional policies and initiatives.\n\n[SECTION] Major Cities [/SECTION]\n**Nagoya** (2,327,557)\nRole: Economic hub and capital of Aichi Prefecture\nKnown For: Its castle, museums, and traditional Japanese architecture, as well as its modern shopping and entertainment districts\nBest For: Business travelers, history buffs, and shoppers\n\n**Kanazawa** (455,595)\nRole: Cultural center and capital of Ishikawa Prefecture\nKnown For: Its well-preserved Edo-era (1603-1867) architecture, beautiful gardens, and high-quality gold leaf products\nBest For: Cultural enthusiasts, history buffs, and those interested in traditional Japanese crafts\n\n**Toyama** (418,686)\nRole: Port city and capital of Toyama Prefecture\nKnown For: Its stunning natural beauty, including the Japanese Alps and the Toyama Bay, as well as its modern city center and historic castle\nBest For: Outdoor enthusiasts, nature lovers, and those interested in history and culture\n\n**Niigata** (797,429)\nRole: Port city and capital of Niigata Prefecture\nKnown For: Its beautiful coastal scenery, historic landmarks, and modern city center\nBest For: Beachgoers, history buffs, and those interested in seafood and local cuisine\n\n**Hamamatsu** (794,025)\nRole: Industrial center and city in Shizuoka Prefecture\nKnown For: Its manufacturing industry, musical instrument production, and historic castle\nBest For: Business travelers, music enthusiasts, and those interested in history and industry\n\n[SECTION] Key Regions [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Region | Character | Known For | Major City |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Tokai | Urban and industrial | Manufacturing, technology, and transportation hubs | Nagoya |\n| Hokuriku | Coastal and natural | Scenic coastline, historic cities, and natural beauty | Kanazawa |\n| Koshinetsu | Mountainous and rural | Natural hot springs, ski resorts, and traditional villages | Nagano |\n| Aichi | Urban and industrial | Manufacturing, technology, and automotive production | Nagoya |\n| Ishikawa | Coastal and cultural | Historic cities, traditional crafts, and natural beauty | Kanazawa |\n| Toyama | Coastal and natural | Scenic coastline, historic landmarks, and outdoor recreation | Toyama |\n| Niigata | Coastal and rural | Natural beauty, historic landmarks, and agricultural production | Niigata |\n| Shizuoka | Urban and industrial | Manufacturing, technology, and agricultural production | Hamamatsu |\n| Nagano | Mountainous and rural | Natural hot springs, ski resorts, and traditional villages | Nagano |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Differences [/SECTION]\n- The regions of Chubu differ significantly in terms of culture, with the Tokai region being more urban and industrial, while the Hokuriku and Koshinetsu regions are more rural and traditional.\n- The economy of the region also varies, with the Tokai region being a major manufacturing and technology hub, while the Hokuriku and Koshinetsu regions are more focused on agriculture, tourism, and natural resources.\n- The climate of the region differs, with the coastal regions being generally milder and more humid, while the mountainous regions are colder and more snowy.\n- The language and dialects of the region also vary, with the Tokai region speaking a more standard form of Japanese, while the Hokuriku and Koshinetsu regions have their own unique dialects and accents.\n\n[SECTION] Getting Around [/SECTION]\nChubu has a well-developed transportation network, with domestic flights, trains, buses, and highways connecting the major cities and regions.
