The system is primarily public, with both public and private hospitals and clinics operating under strict guidelines to ensure high standards of care. The quality of care in Chubu is excellent, with well-trained medical professionals and modern facilities. Urban areas tend to have better access to healthcare services, including specialized care, compared to rural areas, where services might be more limited but still adequate.\n\nThe healthcare system in Chubu is designed to ensure that everyone has access to necessary medical care. Patients can choose their healthcare providers, and the cost is generally affordable, with most expenses covered by insurance. The system emphasizes preventive care, with regular check-ups and screenings encouraged to detect and manage health issues early.\n\nDespite the excellent quality of care, there can be challenges for foreign residents and visitors, particularly in terms of language barriers. Many healthcare professionals in larger hospitals and clinics speak some English, but it's not universal. Therefore, having a basic understanding of Japanese or being accompanied by someone who speaks Japanese can be helpful in navigating the healthcare system.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Nagoya University Hospital | Nagoya | Public | General, specialized surgeries | Yes |\n| Aichi Medical University Hospital | Nagakute | Private | General, cardiovascular diseases | Limited |\n| Gifu University Hospital | Gifu | Public | General, neurosurgery | Yes |\n| Mie University Hospital | Tsu | Public | General, pediatric care | Limited |\n| Shizuoka General Hospital | Shizuoka | Public | General, oncology | Yes |\n| Toyama University Hospital | Toyama | Public | General, orthopedic surgery | Limited |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **National Health Insurance (NHI)** is the primary insurance system in Japan, including Chubu, which covers most medical expenses for residents.\n- Private insurance is available to supplement NHI, covering additional expenses such as private room stays or certain treatments not covered by NHI.\n- Expats and foreigners are required to enroll in the NHI system if they reside in Japan for more than three months, unless they have a valid exemption.\n- The cost of NHI is based on income, with premiums adjusted annually.\n- Some employers offer private insurance as part of their employment packages, which can be beneficial for covering expenses not included in NHI.\n- It's recommended for visitors to have travel insurance that covers medical expenses, as NHI does not cover non-residents.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- Medications are widely available in pharmacies across Chubu, with many locations open late or 24 hours.\n- A prescription from a licensed doctor is required for most medications, including some over-the-counter drugs available in other countries.\n- Common brand names may differ from those in other countries, but generic versions are often available.\n- Pharmacists are generally knowledgeable and can offer advice on non-prescription medications and health supplements.\n- Costs for medications are generally reasonable, with many covered by NHI or private insurance.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- Routine vaccinations such as MMR, DTaP, and flu shots are recommended for all residents and visitors.\n- Japan, including Chubu, has a risk of certain infectious diseases such as hepatitis A and B, for which vaccinations are recommended.\n- Rabies is present in bats, but the risk to humans is low.\n- Water is safe to drink from the tap, and food safety standards are high.\n- Japanese encephalitis is a risk in rural areas, particularly during the summer months, and vaccination may be recommended for long-term residents or frequent travelers to these areas.\n- Influenza outbreaks can occur seasonally, and vaccination is recommended for all, especially the elderly and those with chronic conditions.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- Chubu, with its advanced medical facilities and high standard of care, is a destination for medical tourism, particularly for specialized treatments such as cancer care and cardiovascular surgery.\n- Some hospitals, like Nagoya University Hospital, are accredited for international patient care and offer services tailored to foreign patients.\n- The cost savings for certain procedures can be significant compared to some Western countries, making Chubu an attractive option for those seeking quality care at a lower cost.\n- Popular procedures among medical tourists include orthopedic surgeries, cosmetic surgeries, and fertility treatments.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- In case of an emergency, dial 119 for ambulance services, which are reliable and efficient.\n- Major hospitals have emergency departments that can handle acute conditions, including trauma care.\n- For less urgent situations, clinics and smaller hospitals can provide immediate care, and some have extended hours.\n- It's advisable to have some basic Japanese phrases or a translation app to communicate with emergency services.\n- Insurance claims for emergency treatments can usually be filed afterwards, and many hospitals have staff to assist with this process.",
