[SECTION] How Chubu Is Divided [/SECTION]
Chubu is a region located in the center of Honshu, the largest island of Japan, and is divided into 9 prefectures. The region is often further subdivided into three sub-regions: Tokai, Hokuriku, and Koshinetsu. The Tokai sub-region includes the prefectures of Aichi, Gifu, and Shizuoka, and is known for its urban areas and industrial centers. The Hokuriku sub-region includes the prefectures of Ishikawa, Fukui, and Toyama, and is known for its coastal cities and natural beauty. The Koshinetsu sub-region includes the prefectures of Nagano, Niigata, and Yamanashi, and is known for its mountainous terrain and natural hot springs.

The administrative structure of Chubu is complex, with each prefecture having its own government and administrative powers. However, the region as a whole is not a single administrative entity, and is instead a collection of prefectures that are linked by geography and economy. This structure allows for a great deal of autonomy and flexibility, but can also make it difficult to coordinate regional policies and initiatives.
