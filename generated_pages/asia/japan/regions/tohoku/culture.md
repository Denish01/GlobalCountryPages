Tohoku's culture is defined by its strong sense of community, traditional practices, and the influence of its indigenous people, the Ainu. The region's cultural identity is also shaped by its history, including the devastating 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami, which had a profound impact on the local population. The ethnic and linguistic makeup of Tohoku is predominantly Japanese, with the majority of the population speaking the Japanese language.

Tohoku's cultural identity is also reflected in its traditional crafts, such as woodworking, pottery, and textiles, which are highly valued and preserved by the local community.

The region's cultural heritage is also influenced by its geographic location, with the Pacific Ocean to the east and the Japanese Alps to the west. This unique location has shaped the local way of life, with many communities relying on the sea for fishing and the mountains for forestry and agriculture.
