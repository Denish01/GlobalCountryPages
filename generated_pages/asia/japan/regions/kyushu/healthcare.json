The system is primarily public, with both public and private hospitals and clinics offering high-quality medical care. The quality of care in Kyushu is excellent, with well-trained medical professionals and modern medical facilities. However, there may be some differences in the quality of care between urban and rural areas, with urban areas generally having more advanced medical facilities and specialized care. In rural areas, medical facilities may be more limited, but the Japanese government has implemented various initiatives to improve access to healthcare in these areas.\n\nThe healthcare system in Kyushu is primarily funded through a combination of government subsidies, insurance premiums, and out-of-pocket payments. Patients are required to pay a portion of their medical expenses, but the costs are generally reasonable. Foreigners living in Kyushu are required to enroll in the national health insurance system, which provides comprehensive coverage for medical expenses. The system is relatively easy to navigate, with many medical professionals speaking some English, especially in urban areas.\n\nKyushu's healthcare system is also known for its emphasis on preventive care, with regular health check-ups and screenings being an integral part of the system. This approach has contributed to Japan's high life expectancy and low infant mortality rates. Overall, Kyushu's healthcare system is well-regarded and provides high-quality medical care to its residents and visitors.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Kyushu University Hospital | Fukuoka | Public | General, Cardiovascular, Cancer | Yes |\n| Fukuoka University Hospital | Fukuoka | Private | General, Orthopedic, Neurosurgery | Yes |\n| Sasebo City General Hospital | Sasebo | Public | General, Emergency, Pediatrics | Limited |\n| Nagasaki University Hospital | Nagasaki | Public | General, Radiation, Oncology | Yes |\n| Kumamoto University Hospital | Kumamoto | Public | General, Neurology, Urology | Limited |\n| Oita University Hospital | Oita | Public | General, Gastroenterology, Nephrology | Yes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **National Health Insurance** is required for all residents, including foreigners, and provides comprehensive coverage for medical expenses\n- **Private health insurance** is also available, but not necessary, as the national health insurance system provides adequate coverage\n- **Travel insurance** is recommended for visitors to Kyushu, as it can provide additional coverage for unexpected medical expenses\n- **Expats** are required to enroll in the national health insurance system, which provides coverage for medical expenses\n- **Costs** for health insurance vary depending on age, income, and other factors, but are generally reasonable\n- **Pre-existing conditions** may be covered under the national health insurance system, but may require additional documentation and approval\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Prescription medications** are widely available at pharmacies throughout Kyushu\n- **Over-the-counter medications** are also available, but may require a prescription from a doctor\n- **Common brands** of medications are available, including international brands\n- **Costs** for medications are generally reasonable, with many medications being subsidized by the government\n- **Prescription requirements** vary depending on the type of medication, but generally require a prescription from a licensed doctor\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Routine vaccinations**, such as MMR and DTaP, are recommended for all travelers to Kyushu\n- **Influenza vaccination** is recommended, especially during the winter months\n- **Hepatitis A and B vaccinations** are recommended for travelers who will be eating or drinking outside of major restaurants and hotels\n- **Japanese encephalitis vaccination** is recommended for travelers who will be spending time outdoors in rural areas\n- **Water safety** is generally good in Kyushu, with tap water being safe to drink\n- **Food safety** is also good, with a low risk of foodborne illness\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **Popular procedures** for medical tourism in Kyushu include cosmetic surgery, orthopedic surgery, and cancer treatment\n- **Accredited hospitals** in Kyushu, such as Kyushu University Hospital, offer high-quality medical care for international patients\n- **Cost savings** can be significant for medical tourists, with prices for medical procedures being lower than in many Western countries\n- **Language support** is available for international patients, with many medical professionals speaking English\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- **Emergency number** is 119, which can be dialed from any phone in Kyushu\n- **Ambulance reliability** is excellent, with ambulances being well-equipped and staffed by trained medical professionals\n- **Nearest hospitals** can be found by asking locals or using a mapping app on a smartphone\n- **Insurance claims** can be filed with the national health insurance system or private insurance company, depending on the type of insurance\n- **Medical evacuation** may be necessary in some cases, especially for serious medical conditions, and can be arranged through the national health insurance system or private insurance company",
