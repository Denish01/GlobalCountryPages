Kyushu's healthcare system is part of Japan's national healthcare system, which provides universal coverage to all citizens and registered foreigners. The system is primarily public, with both public and private hospitals and clinics offering high-quality medical care. The quality of care in Kyushu is excellent, with well-trained medical professionals and modern medical facilities. However, there may be some differences in the quality of care between urban and rural areas, with urban areas generally having more advanced medical facilities and specialized care. In rural areas, medical facilities may be more limited, but the Japanese government has implemented various initiatives to improve access to healthcare in these areas.

The healthcare system in Kyushu is primarily funded through a combination of government subsidies, insurance premiums, and out-of-pocket payments. Patients are required to pay a portion of their medical expenses, but the costs are generally reasonable. Foreigners living in Kyushu are required to enroll in the national health insurance system, which provides comprehensive coverage for medical expenses. The system is relatively easy to navigate, with many medical professionals speaking some English, especially in urban areas.

Kyushu's healthcare system is also known for its emphasis on preventive care, with regular health check-ups and screenings being an integral part of the system. This approach has contributed to Japan's high life expectancy and low infant mortality rates. Overall, Kyushu's healthcare system is well-regarded and provides high-quality medical care to its residents and visitors.
