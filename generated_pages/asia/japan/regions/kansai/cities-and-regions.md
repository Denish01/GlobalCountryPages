Kansai is a region located in the southern-central part of Japan's main island, Honshu, and is comprised of seven prefectures: Osaka, Kyoto, Hyogo, Nara, Wakayama, Shiga, and Mie. These prefectures are further divided into cities, towns, and villages, each with their own local government and administrative structures. The region is not a single administrative entity, but rather a cultural and geographic area that is loosely defined by its shared history, language, and customs.

For example, the city of Osaka has long been a major commercial and economic hub, while Kyoto is known for its cultural and historical significance.
