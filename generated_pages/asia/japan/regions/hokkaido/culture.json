The indigenous Ainu people, who have lived in Hokkaido for thousands of years, have had a significant impact on the region's culture, with their traditional practices, language, and customs still visible today. The Japanese influence, which began in the 19th century, has also played a major role in shaping Hokkaido's culture, with many Japanese settlers bringing their own customs and traditions to the region. As a result, Hokkaido's culture is a unique blend of traditional Japanese and Ainu influences, with a distinct flavor of its own.\n\nThe ethnic and linguistic makeup of Hokkaido is predominantly Japanese, with the majority of the population speaking Japanese as their first language. However, there are still many Ainu people living in Hokkaido, and efforts are being made to preserve and promote the Ainu language and culture. The region's cultural identity is also reflected in its cuisine, with a focus on fresh seafood, dairy products, and other local ingredients. The harsh climate and rugged landscape of Hokkaido have also shaped the region's culture, with many traditional practices and customs centered around the changing of the seasons and the availability of certain foods.\n\nHokkaido's cultural identity is also reflected in its many festivals and traditions, which celebrate the region's unique history and heritage.
