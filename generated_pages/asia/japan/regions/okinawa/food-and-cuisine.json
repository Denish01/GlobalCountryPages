The unique combination of ingredients, such as **goya** (bitter melon), **umibudo** (sea grapes), and **rafute** (braised pork belly), creates a flavor profile that is both familiar and exotic. Okinawan cuisine is also known for its emphasis on **nuru** (locally grown) ingredients and **kusu** (fermented) foods, which add depth and complexity to the dishes. The cuisine has been influenced by the island's geographic location, with an abundance of seafood and tropical fruits, as well as the cultural exchange with neighboring countries, resulting in a unique fusion of flavors and cooking techniques.\n\nThe Ryukyu Kingdom, which once ruled Okinawa, played a significant role in shaping the local cuisine, with the introduction of **sugar**, **tea**, and **Chinese noodles**. The kingdom's trade relationships with China, Japan, and other Asian countries also brought new ingredients and cooking techniques to the island. Today, Okinawan cuisine is a vibrant reflection of the island's history and cultural heritage, with a focus on fresh, locally sourced ingredients and traditional cooking methods.\n\nOkinawa's cuisine is also characterized by its emphasis on **longevity** and **well-being**, with many dishes designed to promote health and vitality. The island is famous for its high percentage of **centenarians**, and the local cuisine is believed to play a significant role in this phenomenon. The combination of **antioxidant-rich** ingredients, **fermented** foods, and **traditional** cooking methods is thought to contribute to the islanders' remarkable health and longevity.\n\n[SECTION] Must-Try Dishes [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Dish | Type | Description | Where to Find |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Goya Champuru | Stir-fry | Stir-fry made with bitter melon, tofu, and eggs | Local restaurants and markets |\n| Rafute | Braised pork | Braised pork belly in a sweet soy sauce-based sauce | Traditional Okinawan restaurants |\n| Soki Soba | Noodle dish | Thin noodles served with soki (stewed pork) and vegetables | Soba noodle shops and markets |\n| Umibudo | Appetizer | Sea grapes served with a sweet and sour sauce | High-end restaurants and seafood markets |\n| Yakitori | Grilled chicken | Grilled chicken skewers flavored with salt and **yuzu** | Street food stalls and yakitori restaurants |\n| Sashimi | Raw fish dish | Fresh raw fish sliced into thin pieces and served with soy sauce and wasabi | Sushi restaurants and seafood markets |\n| Okinawan-style Donburi | Rice bowl dish | A bowl of rice topped with **rafute**, **soki**, and vegetables | Local restaurants and food courts |\n| Hiyashi Chuka | Cold noodle dish | Cold noodles served with **hiyayakko** (cold tofu) and **yuzu** sauce | Ramen shops and noodle restaurants |\n| Orion Beer | Local beer | A crisp and refreshing beer brewed in Okinawa | Bars, restaurants, and convenience stores |\n| Shikwasa | Citrus juice | A refreshing juice made from **shikwasa** (Okinawan citrus) | Local markets and juice bars |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Street Food & Snacks [/SECTION]\n- **Yakitori** (grilled chicken skewers): 500-700 JPY ($4-6 USD) per skewer\n- **Umibudo** (sea grapes): 1,000-1,500 JPY ($9-14 USD) per serving\n- **Soki** (stewed pork): 500-700 JPY ($4-6 USD) per serving\n- **Goya tempura**: 500-700 JPY ($4-6 USD) per serving\n- **Rafute sandwich**: 800-1,000 JPY ($7-9 USD) per sandwich\n- **Shikwasa juice**: 500-700 JPY ($4-6 USD) per cup\n- **Orion beer**: 500-700 JPY ($4-6 USD) per bottle\n- **Okinawan-style crepe**: 800-1,000 JPY ($7-9 USD) per crepe\n\n[SECTION] Drinks [/SECTION]\n- **Orion beer**: a crisp and refreshing beer brewed in Okinawa\n- **Shikwasa juice**: a refreshing juice made from **shikwasa** (Okinawan citrus)\n- **Awamori**: a traditional Okinawan spirit made from rice and **black koji**\n- **Ryukyu coffee**: a unique coffee blend made from locally grown coffee beans\n- **Okinawan tea**: a traditional tea made from **sanpin** (Okinawan jasmine tea) and **gyokuro** (Japanese green tea)\n- **Kokuto shochu**: a sweet potato-based spirit made in Okinawa\n\n[SECTION] Dining Customs [/SECTION]\n- **Table manners**: it is customary to wait for the host to start eating before you begin\n- **Chopstick etiquette**: it is considered impolite to leave your chopsticks standing upright in your rice bowl\n- **Tipping**: not customary, but a small tip may be appreciated for exceptional service\n- **Dress code**: casual dress is acceptable in most restaurants, but formal attire may be required in high-end establishments\n- **Reservation culture**: reservations are recommended for popular restaurants, especially during peak travel seasons\n- **Food ordering**: it is customary to order a variety of dishes to share with your dining companions\n\n[SECTION] Where to Eat [/SECTION]\n- **Local markets**: try **Kokusai-dori** market in Naha for a variety of street food and snacks\n- **Food courts**: visit **Rycom** food court in Naha for a range of Okinawan dishes\n- **Traditional Okinawan restaurants**: try **Yubaru** in Naha for authentic Okinawan cuisine\n- **Sushi restaurants**: visit **Sushi-no-midori** in Naha for fresh sushi and sashimi\n- **Street food stalls**: try **Yakitori** stalls in **Heiwa-dori** market in Naha for grilled chicken skewers\n\n[SECTION] Food Markets & Food Experiences [/SECTION]\n- **Kokusai-dori** market: a lively market in Naha offering a variety of street food and snacks\n- **Rycom** food court: a food court in Naha featuring a range of Okinawan dishes\n- **Naha public market**: a market in Naha offering fresh seafood and local produce\n- **Okinawa World** theme park: a theme park in Naha offering a variety of Okinawan dishes and snacks\n- **Shuri castle** food stalls: food stalls located near Shuri castle in Naha, offering traditional Okinawan snacks and drinks",
