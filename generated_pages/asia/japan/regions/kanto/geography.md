[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Kanto is situated in the eastern part of Honshu, the largest island of Japan, and is bordered by the Pacific Ocean to the east. The region is surrounded by the Japanese Alps to the west, the Tohoku region to the north, and the Chubu region to the west. Kanto is also home to several major islands, including the Izu Islands and the Ogasawara Islands, which are located off the coast of Tokyo. The region's unique location makes it prone to earthquakes and volcanic activity, with several active volcanoes located in the area.

The Kanto region is also home to several major cities, including Tokyo, Yokohama, and Chiba, which are all located along the coast of the Pacific Ocean. The region's coastline is characterized by several large bays, including Tokyo Bay and Sagami Bay, which provide important ports for shipping and trade. The Japanese government has also established several national parks in the region, including the Nikko National Park and the Ogasawara National Park, which provide protection for the region's unique natural environment.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
The Kanto region is characterized by a diverse range of landscapes, including mountains, forests, and coastal plains. The Japanese Alps, which run along the western edge of the region, are home to several major mountain peaks, including Mount Nikko-Shirane, which is the highest point in the region. The mountains are covered in dense forests, including **temperate rainforests** and **deciduous forests**, which provide habitat for a wide range of plant and animal species. The region is also home to several major rivers, including the Tone River and the Sumida River, which flow through the cities of Tokyo and Yokohama.

The coastal plains of the Kanto region are generally flat and low-lying, with several large bays and inlets along the coast of the Pacific Ocean. The region is also home to several large islands, including the Izu Islands and the Ogasawara Islands, which are located off the coast of Tokyo. The islands are volcanic in origin and are characterized by steep cliffs, rocky shores, and dense forests. The Kanto region is also home to several major wetlands, including the Tokyo Bay and the Kashima Sea, which provide important habitat for migratory birds and other wildlife.

The region's terrain is also characterized by several major fault lines, including the **Tokyo Bay Fault** and the **Izu-Bonin-Mariana Arc**, which run along the coast of the Pacific Ocean. The fault lines are responsible for the region's high level of seismic activity, with several major earthquakes occurring in the region each year. The region's unique geology also makes it prone to volcanic activity, with several active volcanoes located in the area, including **Mount Fuji** and **Mount Hakone**.
