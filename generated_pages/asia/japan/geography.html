        <h2>Location & Borders</h2>
        <p>Japan is an island country located in East Asia, situated in the Pacific Ocean. It is part of the Asian continent, but is not directly connected to the mainland. The country is comprised of over 6,800 islands, with the four largest islands being Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, and Shikoku. Japan is bordered by several bodies of water, including the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Sea of Japan to the west, and the East China Sea to the southwest. The country's closest neighbors are South Korea to the west, China to the southwest, and Russia to the north.</p>
        <p>Japan's unique geography has played a significant role in shaping its history and culture. The country's island location has allowed it to maintain a distinct identity, while its proximity to the Asian mainland has facilitated trade and cultural exchange. The surrounding bodies of water have also had a profound impact on Japan's climate and ecosystem, with the warm waters of the Pacific Ocean bringing mild winters and hot summers to the southern islands. The country's northern islands, on the other hand, are influenced by the cold waters of the Sea of Japan, resulting in colder winters and cooler summers.</p>
        <h2>Terrain & Landscape</h2>
        <p>Japan is a country of diverse landscapes, with a mix of mountains, forests, and coastlines. The country's terrain is dominated by mountains, with over 70% of the land area being mountainous. The Japanese Alps, which run along the center of Honshu, are the most prominent mountain range, with peaks reaching elevations of over 3,000 meters. The highest point in Japan is Mount Fuji, a iconic stratovolcano located on the island of Honshu. The mountain is not only a prominent landmark but also a sacred site, with many Japanese people making pilgrimages to the summit each year.</p>
        <p>In addition to its mountains, Japan is also home to numerous rivers, lakes, and wetlands. The country's longest river is the Shinano River, which flows through the northern island of Honshu and empties into the Sea of Japan. Japan's lakes and wetlands are also important habitats for a wide range of wildlife, including birds, fish, and other aquatic species. The country's coastline is equally diverse, with a mix of sandy beaches, rocky shores, and coral reefs. The coastline is also home to many of Japan's major cities, including Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya.</p>
        <p>Japan's forests are another notable feature of the country's landscape. The country is home to a wide range of tree species, including cedar, cypress, and pine. The forests are not only important for their ecological value but also for their cultural significance, with many Japanese people believing that the forests are inhabited by spirits and other supernatural beings. The forests are also an important part of Japan's economy, with the country's forestry industry providing a significant source of income for many rural communities.</p>

        </table></div>
