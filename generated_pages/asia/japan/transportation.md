In addition to flying, Japan can also be reached by ferry from neighboring countries, such as South Korea and China, or by train and bus from countries like Russia and North Korea, although these options are less common.

For those traveling overland, Japan has several major entry points, including the port city of Hakata in Fukuoka, which is connected to Busan, South Korea by ferry, and the city of Aomori, which is connected to Russia by ferry.
