The **National Diet**, Japan's bicameral legislature, is composed of the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors. The House of Representatives has 465 members, elected by **proportional representation** for a four-year term, while the House of Councillors has 248 members, elected by a combination of single-member districts and proportional representation for a six-year term. The **Prime Minister**, who is the head of government, is appointed by the Emperor and is responsible for appointing the **Cabinet**, which is composed of ministers who oversee various government departments.\n\nThe Japanese government is also characterized by a **unitary system**, where the central government has significant authority over the country's 47 prefectures. While prefectures have some autonomy, the central government plays a major role in shaping policy and providing funding. Japan's **Constitution**, which was adopted in 1947, establishes the framework for the country's government and guarantees certain **fundamental rights**, such as freedom of speech and assembly.\n\nThe Japanese political system is also influenced by the concept of **consensus-building**, where decisions are often made through a process of negotiation and compromise between different interest groups and stakeholders. This approach has helped to maintain social cohesion and stability in Japan, but it can also lead to slow decision-making and a lack of bold policy initiatives.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | Cabinet | Prime Minister (Fumio Kishida) | Head of government, appoints ministers |\n| Legislative | National Diet | Speaker of the House of Representatives (Hiroyuki Hosoda) | Makes laws, approves budget |\n| Judicial | Supreme Court | Chief Justice (Saburo Tokura) | Interprets laws, ensures constitutional compliance |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Major Political Parties [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Party | Position | Leader | Seats | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) | Center-right | Fumio Kishida | 261 (House of Representatives) | Dominant party since 1955 |\n| Constitutional Democratic Party (CDP) | Center-left | Kenta Izumi | 96 (House of Representatives) | Main opposition party |\n| Japanese Communist Party (JCP) | Left-wing | Kazuo Shii | 12 (House of Representatives) | Marxist-Leninist party |\n| Komeito | Center | Natsuo Yamaguchi | 32 (House of Representatives) | Buddhist-based party, allied with LDP |\n| Democratic Party for the People (DPFP) | Center | Yuichiro Tamaki | 41 (House of Representatives) | Centrist party, formed in 2018 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Elections [/SECTION]\n- Japan has a **proportional representation** electoral system, where voters elect representatives to the National Diet.\n- Elections for the House of Representatives are held every four years, while elections for the House of Councillors are held every three years.\n- The last general election was held in 2021, with the LDP winning a majority of seats in the House of Representatives.\n- The next general election is scheduled to be held in 2025, although the exact date has not been announced.\n- Voter participation in Japan is generally high, with turnout rates ranging from 50% to 70% in recent elections.\n\n[SECTION] Political Stability & Challenges [/SECTION]\n- Japan has a high level of **political stability**, with a strong economy and a stable government.\n- However, the country faces several **key challenges**, including an aging population, a declining birth rate, and a significant national debt.\n- Japan's **regional dynamics** are also complex, with tensions with neighboring countries such as China and South Korea over issues such as territory and security.\n- The country has a high level of **press freedom**, with a vibrant and independent media sector.\n- Japan also has a strong **civil society**, with many non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and community groups active in areas such as human rights and environmental protection.\n- The country has a **Corruption Perceptions Index** score of 73 out of 100, indicating a relatively low level of corruption.\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Relations [/SECTION]\n- Japan is a member of several **international organizations**, including the United Nations, the G7, and the G20.\n- The country has a **security alliance** with the United States, which provides a significant amount of military support and protection.\n- Japan also has **diplomatic relations** with many countries in Asia, including China, South Korea, and India.\n- The country is a member of the **Trans-Pacific Partnership** (TPP), a regional free trade agreement that aims to promote economic integration and cooperation.\n- Japan has a **diplomatic stance** that emphasizes **multilateralism** and **cooperation**, with a focus on promoting peace, stability, and prosperity in the region.",
