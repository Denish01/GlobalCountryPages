[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Japan has a **territorial taxation** system, where residents are taxed on their worldwide income, while non-residents are taxed only on their Japanese-sourced income. Residency rules for tax purposes in Japan are based on the **183-day rule**, where individuals who stay in Japan for 183 days or more in a calendar year are considered tax residents. However, there are exceptions and additional considerations, such as the **5-year rule**, where individuals who have been a resident in Japan for 5 years or more are considered **long-term residents**, subject to taxation on their worldwide income.

The Japanese tax system is complex, with multiple tax brackets and deductions available. Taxpayers can claim deductions for **mortgage interest**, **charitable donations**, and **medical expenses**, among others. The tax year in Japan runs from January to December, and taxpayers are required to file their tax returns by March 15th of the following year. Tax returns can be filed electronically or by mail, and taxpayers can also seek the assistance of a tax professional or accountant to ensure compliance with tax laws and regulations.
