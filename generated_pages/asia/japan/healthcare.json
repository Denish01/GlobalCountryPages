The system is divided into two main categories: public and private. Public healthcare facilities are generally less expensive and more accessible, while private facilities often offer more luxurious amenities and specialized care. The quality of care in Japan is among the highest in the world, with well-trained medical professionals and state-of-the-art equipment. However, there can be significant differences in access to healthcare between urban and rural areas, with rural areas often having fewer medical facilities and specialists.\n\nThe Japanese government plays a significant role in regulating the healthcare system, setting standards for medical facilities and professionals, and controlling costs. Despite the high quality of care, Japan's healthcare system faces challenges such as an aging population and a shortage of medical professionals in certain specialties. To address these challenges, the government has implemented various initiatives, including increasing funding for healthcare and promoting the use of technology to improve healthcare services.\n\nOverall, Japan's healthcare system is well-organized and provides high-quality care to its citizens. With its universal coverage and wide range of medical facilities, Japan is an excellent destination for those seeking medical care. However, it is essential to understand the system and plan ahead, especially for foreigners, to ensure access to the best possible care.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n|
