[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Turkmenistan has a command economy, characterized by a strong central government control over key sectors, including energy, agriculture, and manufacturing. The country's economic classification as an upper-middle-income economy is primarily due to its large natural gas reserves, which drive the majority of its economic activity. However, the government has been working to diversify the economy, investing in infrastructure, manufacturing, and services. The country's economic development level is relatively high, with a growing middle class and increasing access to education and healthcare. Despite this, the economy still faces challenges, including a lack of transparency, corruption, and limited economic freedoms.

The country's economic trajectory has been marked by significant growth in recent years, driven by large-scale investments in the energy sector and infrastructure development. However, the economy is highly dependent on a single industry, making it vulnerable to fluctuations in global energy prices. The government has been working to reduce this dependence, investing in other sectors such as manufacturing, tourism, and agriculture. The country's strategic location at the crossroads of Europe and Asia also provides opportunities for trade and investment, with several major transportation corridors passing through the country.

Turkmenistan's economic development has also been influenced by its history as a former Soviet republic, with a legacy of centralized planning and state control. The country has been working to transition to a more market-based economy, but the process has been slow, and the government still maintains a strong grip on key sectors. Despite these challenges, the country has made significant progress in recent years, with a growing economy and increasing living standards.
