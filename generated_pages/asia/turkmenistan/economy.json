  "content": "Turkmenistan's economy is driven primarily by its vast natural gas reserves and a strong government-controlled sector, with a growing focus on diversification and development of other industries. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nGDP (nominal): ($42.8 billion estimate)\nGDP Per Capita: ($6,463 estimate)\nIncome Classification: Upper-Middle\nMain Industries: Natural Gas, Cotton, Textiles\nCurrency: TMT\nUnemployment Rate: (approximately 3.2%)\nEase of Doing Business: (ranked 86 out of 190 countries)\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]\nTurkmenistan has a command economy, characterized by a strong central government control over key sectors, including energy, agriculture, and manufacturing. The country's economic classification as an upper-middle-income economy is primarily due to its large natural gas reserves, which drive the majority of its economic activity. However, the government has been working to diversify the economy, investing in infrastructure, manufacturing, and services. The country's economic development level is relatively high, with a growing middle class and increasing access to education and healthcare. Despite this, the economy still faces challenges, including a lack of transparency, corruption, and limited economic freedoms.\n\nThe country's economic trajectory has been marked by significant growth in recent years, driven by large-scale investments in the energy sector and infrastructure development. However, the economy is highly dependent on a single industry, making it vulnerable to fluctuations in global energy prices. The government has been working to reduce this dependence, investing in other sectors such as manufacturing, tourism, and agriculture. The country's strategic location at the crossroads of Europe and Asia also provides opportunities for trade and investment, with several major transportation corridors passing through the country.\n\nTurkmenistan's economic development has also been influenced by its history as a former Soviet republic, with a legacy of centralized planning and state control. The country has been working to transition to a more market-based economy, but the process has been slow, and the government still maintains a strong grip on key sectors. Despite these challenges, the country has made significant progress in recent years, with a growing economy and increasing living standards.\n\n[SECTION] Key Industries [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Industry | Contribution | Details |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Natural Gas | 60% of GDP | Turkmenistan has the fourth-largest natural gas reserves in the world, with major fields including the South Iolotan-Osman field |\n| Cotton | 10% of GDP | Cotton is a major crop in Turkmenistan, with the country producing over 1 million tons per year |\n| Textiles | 5% of GDP | The textile industry is a significant sector in Turkmenistan, with a focus on producing high-quality cotton products |\n| Manufacturing | 5% of GDP | The manufacturing sector is growing in Turkmenistan, with a focus on producing goods such as fertilizers, chemicals, and construction materials |\n| Agriculture | 10% of GDP | Agriculture is an important sector in Turkmenistan, with crops including wheat, cotton, and vegetables, as well as livestock such as sheep and cattle |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Trade Profile [/SECTION]\n**Top Exports:** \n- **Natural Gas**: The country's largest export, with major markets including China, Russia, and Iran\n- **Cotton**: A significant export, with markets including Turkey, China, and Bangladesh\n- **Textiles**: Turkmenistan exports a range of textile products, including cotton fabrics and clothing\n- **Petroleum Products**: The country exports refined petroleum products, including gasoline and diesel fuel\n- **Fertilizers**: Turkmenistan produces and exports fertilizers, including ammonia and urea\n**Top Imports:** \n- **Machinery**: The country imports a range of machinery, including equipment for the energy and manufacturing sectors\n- **Vehicles**: Turkmenistan imports vehicles, including cars, trucks, and buses\n- **Electronics**: The country imports electronic goods, including computers, phones, and televisions\n- **Food**: Turkmenistan imports food products, including wheat, sugar, and meat\n- **Construction Materials**: The country imports construction materials, including steel, cement, and glass\n**Key Trading Partners:** \n- China: A major trading partner, with significant imports of natural gas and exports of machinery and electronics\n- Russia: A key partner in the energy sector, with imports of natural gas and exports of petroleum products\n- Turkey: A significant trading partner, with imports of textiles and exports of machinery and electronics\n- Iran: A major trading partner, with imports of natural gas and exports of petroleum products\n- Kazakhstan: A key partner in the energy sector, with imports of natural gas and exports of petroleum products\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n- The country has a well-developed transportation network, including over 2,000 km of railways and 50,000 km of roads\n- Turkmenistan has a growing energy sector, with several major power plants and a significant increase in electricity generation capacity\n- The country has invested heavily in internet and mobile infrastructure, with over 90% of the population having access to mobile phones and over 50% having access to the internet\n- Turkmenistan has several major ports, including the Port of Turkmenbashi, which handles cargo shipments to and from the Caspian Sea\n- The country has several international airports, including the Ashgabat International Airport, which offers flights to destinations including Europe, Asia, and the Middle East\n\n[SECTION] Economic Outlook [/SECTION]\nTurkmenistan's economic outlook is positive, with a growing economy and increasing investment in key sectors.
