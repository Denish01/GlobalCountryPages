[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]
The cost of food in Turkmenistan is influenced by the country's geographical location, which makes it reliant on imports for many goods, driving up prices. Additionally, the government's **subsidy** programs for certain staples like bread and flour help keep prices relatively stable for these items. However, other food products, particularly **meat** and **dairy**, can be quite expensive due to high demand and limited local production. Eating out is not as common in Turkmenistan as in other countries, and when people do dine out, it is often at **traditional teahouses** or **local eateries** that serve traditional dishes like **plov** and **shashlik**.

In terms of home cooking, many Turkmen people still rely on **traditional ingredients** like **rice**, **vegetables**, and **meat**, which can be purchased at **local markets** or **supermarkets**. The cost of these staples can vary depending on the location, with prices tend to be higher in the capital city of Ashgabat. Overall, while food prices in Turkmenistan may be higher than in some neighboring countries, the government's subsidy programs and the availability of traditional ingredients help make food relatively affordable for the local population.

[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]
When it comes to shopping for groceries, Turkmen consumers have the option of choosing between **supermarkets** and **local markets**. While supermarkets tend to offer a wider range of products, including **imported goods**, prices can be significantly higher than at local markets. In contrast, local markets offer a more **traditional shopping experience**, with vendors selling fresh produce, meat, and dairy products at lower prices. However, the quality and variety of products may vary, and **bargaining** is often expected. For example, a kilogram of **apples** may cost $2-$3 USD at a supermarket, but only $1-$2 USD at a local market.

In general, it is recommended to buy **fresh produce** and **meat** at local markets, where prices are lower and the products are often fresher. For **packaged goods** and **imported products**, supermarkets may be a better option, despite the higher prices. It is also worth noting that **bargaining** is a common practice at local markets, so consumers should be prepared to negotiate prices. Additionally, some local markets may offer **better quality** products than others, so it is worth exploring different options to find the best value.
