[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Turkmenistan has a relatively small population compared to its vast territory, with an average population density of 14.5 people per square kilometer. The population has been steadily growing over the years, with an estimated annual growth rate of 1.1%. The country's population is expected to continue growing, albeit at a slow pace, due to a relatively high total fertility rate of 2.1 children per woman. Urbanization is also on the rise, with approximately 52% of the population living in urban areas, primarily in the capital city of Ashgabat and other major cities like Turkmenabat and Dashoguz.

The population of Turkmenistan is relatively young, with a median age of 27.5 years, which presents both opportunities and challenges for the country's economic and social development. The country's population growth trends are influenced by factors such as improvements in healthcare, education, and living standards, as well as migration patterns. However, the country also faces challenges related to brain drain, with many young and educated Turkmen seeking better opportunities abroad.

The government of Turkmenistan has implemented various policies to manage population growth and urbanization, including investments in infrastructure, housing, and social services. However, the country still faces significant challenges related to poverty, inequality, and access to basic services, particularly in rural areas. Addressing these challenges will be crucial to ensuring the well-being and prosperity of the population and promoting sustainable development.
