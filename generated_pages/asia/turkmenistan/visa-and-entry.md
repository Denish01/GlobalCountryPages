# Turkmenistan Visa & Entry Requirements

You will likely need a visa to enter Turkmenistan, as the country has a strict visa policy, but the specific requirements depend on your nationality and the purpose of your visit.

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Turkmenistan has a strict visa policy, with only a few countries eligible for visa-free access. Citizens of certain countries, including Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan, can enter Turkmenistan without a visa for a limited period, typically up to 30 days. However, for most nationalities, a visa is required, and the application process can be complex and time-consuming.

The Turkmen government has introduced some measures to simplify the visa process, such as the introduction of an electronic visa system for certain nationalities. However, the overall visa policy remains relatively restrictive, with a focus on ensuring national security and controlling the flow of foreign visitors.
