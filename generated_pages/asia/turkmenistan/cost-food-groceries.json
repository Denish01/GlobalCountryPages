  "content": "Food prices in Turkmenistan are relatively high compared to other Central Asian countries, with a meal at a mid-range restaurant costing around $15-$25 USD per person. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nMeal at Inexpensive Restaurant: ($5-$10 USD)\nMeal for 2 at Mid-Range Restaurant: ($25-$40 USD)\nMonthly Grocery Budget (1 person): ($150-$300 USD)\nLocal Beer (500ml): ($2-$5 USD)\nCurrency: TMT\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nThe cost of food in Turkmenistan is influenced by the country's geographical location, which makes it reliant on imports for many goods, driving up prices. Additionally, the government's **subsidy** programs for certain staples like bread and flour help keep prices relatively stable for these items. However, other food products, particularly **meat** and **dairy**, can be quite expensive due to high demand and limited local production. Eating out is not as common in Turkmenistan as in other countries, and when people do dine out, it is often at **traditional teahouses** or **local eateries** that serve traditional dishes like **plov** and **shashlik**.\n\nIn terms of home cooking, many Turkmen people still rely on **traditional ingredients** like **rice**, **vegetables**, and **meat**, which can be purchased at **local markets** or **supermarkets**. The cost of these staples can vary depending on the location, with prices tend to be higher in the capital city of Ashgabat. Overall, while food prices in Turkmenistan may be higher than in some neighboring countries, the government's subsidy programs and the availability of traditional ingredients help make food relatively affordable for the local population.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $1.50-$3.00 | 10-20 TMT | |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $0.50-$1.00 | 3-6 TMT | subsidized price |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $1.50-$3.00 | 10-20 TMT | |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $1.00-$2.00 | 6-12 TMT | |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $5.00-$10.00 | 30-60 TMT | |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $10.00-$20.00 | 60-120 TMT | |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $2.00-$5.00 | 12-30 TMT | |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $1.50-$3.50 | 10-20 TMT | |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $1.00-$2.50 | 6-15 TMT | |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $1.00-$2.00 | 6-12 TMT | |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $5.00-$10.00 | 30-60 TMT | |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $1.00-$2.00 | 6-12 TMT | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $3-$5 | (typical dishes like plov or shashlik) |\n| Casual Restaurant | $10-$20 | (one person, 2-3 courses) |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $25-$40 | (3 courses) |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $50-$100 | (upscale, 3-4 courses) |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $2-$5 | |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $5-$10 | |\n| Cappuccino | $3-$5 | |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $1-$2 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nWhen it comes to shopping for groceries, Turkmen consumers have the option of choosing between **supermarkets** and **local markets**. While supermarkets tend to offer a wider range of products, including **imported goods**, prices can be significantly higher than at local markets. In contrast, local markets offer a more **traditional shopping experience**, with vendors selling fresh produce, meat, and dairy products at lower prices. However, the quality and variety of products may vary, and **bargaining** is often expected. For example, a kilogram of **apples** may cost $2-$3 USD at a supermarket, but only $1-$2 USD at a local market.\n\nIn general, it is recommended to buy **fresh produce** and **meat** at local markets, where prices are lower and the products are often fresher. For **packaged goods** and **imported products**, supermarkets may be a better option, despite the higher prices. It is also worth noting that **bargaining** is a common practice at local markets, so consumers should be prepared to negotiate prices. Additionally, some local markets may offer **better quality** products than others, so it is worth exploring different options to find the best value.\n\n[SECTION] Local Food Tips [/SECTION]\n- The cheapest way to eat in Turkmenistan is to buy **street food** or **local dishes** at traditional eateries, which can cost $3-$5 USD per meal.\n- **Plov** and **shashlik** are traditional dishes that are widely available and relatively affordable, with prices starting from $3-$5 USD per serving.\n- **Local cheese** and **bread** are good value and can be purchased at local markets or supermarkets for $5-$10 USD per kilogram and $0.50-$1.00 USD per loaf, respectively.\n- **Imported goods**, such as **chocolate** or **coffee**, can be expensive and may not be widely available, so it is best to avoid buying them unless necessary.\n- **Fresh produce** is widely available at local markets and can be purchased at lower prices than at supermarkets, with prices starting from $1-$2 USD per kilogram.\n- **Meat** and **dairy products** can be expensive, so it is best to buy them in moderation and opt for **local alternatives** whenever possible.",
