[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Turkmenistan's utility infrastructure is relatively underdeveloped, with frequent power outages and water shortages reported in some areas. The cost of utilities can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher costs during the winter months due to increased demand for heating. The government has implemented measures to improve the utility infrastructure, including investments in renewable energy and grid modernization. However, the cost of utilities remains a significant burden for many households, with the average household spending around 10-15% of their income on utilities.

The quality of utility services in Turkmenistan varies depending on the location, with urban areas tend to have better access to reliable utilities than rural areas. The government has implemented a system of subsidies to help low-income households pay for their utility bills, but the effectiveness of this system is limited. As a result, many households rely on alternative sources of energy, such as propane or coal, which can be hazardous to health and the environment.
