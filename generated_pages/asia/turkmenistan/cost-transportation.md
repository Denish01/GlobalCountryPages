[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Turkmenistan has a relatively underdeveloped public transportation system, with most people relying on **private cars** or **taxis** to get around. The country's capital, Ashgabat, has a more comprehensive network of buses and minibuses, but the quality of public transit can be inconsistent. In rural areas, transportation options are limited, and many people rely on **shared taxis** or **minibuses** to travel between cities.

The government has invested in improving the country's transportation infrastructure, including the construction of new roads and highways. However, the lack of a well-developed public transportation system can make it difficult for tourists and locals alike to get around, especially in rural areas. Despite these challenges, the country's unique cultural heritage and natural beauty make it an attractive destination for travelers, and many are willing to navigate the transportation system to experience all that Turkmenistan has to offer.
