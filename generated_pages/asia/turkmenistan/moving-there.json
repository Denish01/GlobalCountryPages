  "content": "To move to Turkmenistan, you will need to navigate the country's complex visa and residency process, understand the local culture and customs, and be prepared for a unique and potentially challenging expat experience. \n\n[SECTION] Why People Move to Turkmenistan [/SECTION]\nTurkmenistan is a relatively unknown destination for expats, but it offers a unique cultural experience and a chance to explore a country with a rich history and natural beauty. The country has a small but growing expat community, mainly consisting of professionals working in the oil and gas industry, as well as a few adventurous travelers and diplomats. The quality of life in Turkmenistan can be challenging, with limited access to Western amenities and a restrictive government, but for those who are willing to adapt, it can also be a rewarding experience. The capital city, Ashgabat, is a showcase of modern architecture and luxury, with marble-clad buildings and gold-plated monuments, while the countryside offers a glimpse into traditional Turkmen culture and a chance to explore the vast desert landscapes.\n\nThe expat demographics in Turkmenistan are diverse, with people from all over the world, but the community is relatively small and close-knit. Many expats live in Ashgabat, where they can find modern amenities and a relatively high standard of living. However, the city is also known for its strict rules and regulations, and expats need to be careful to respect local customs and traditions. Despite the challenges, many expats find that the unique culture and hospitality of the Turkmen people make the experience worthwhile.\n\nThe quality of life in Turkmenistan is generally good, with low crime rates and a strong sense of community. However, the country is still developing, and expats may need to adapt to limited access to certain amenities and services. The healthcare system is also limited, and serious medical conditions may require evacuation to another country. Overall, Turkmenistan is a unique and fascinating destination that offers a chance to experience a different way of life, but it requires careful planning and preparation.\n\n[SECTION] Visa & Residency Options [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Visa Type | Duration | Requirements | Cost (USD) | Path to PR? |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Tourist | up to 10 days | valid passport, invitation letter, hotel reservation | 50-100 | No |\n| Work Visa | up to 1 year | valid passport, employment contract, medical certificate | 200-500 | Yes |\n| Business/Investor | up to 1 year | valid passport, business plan, investment proof | 500-1000 | Yes |\n| Retirement | up to 1 year | valid passport, proof of pension, medical certificate | 100-300 | No |\n| Student | up to 1 year | valid passport, acceptance letter, proof of funds | 50-100 | No |\n| Digital Nomad | not available | - | - | No |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Relocation Checklist [/SECTION]\n1.
