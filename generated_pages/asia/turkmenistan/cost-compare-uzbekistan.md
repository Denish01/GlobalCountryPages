[SECTION] Overview: Turkmenistan vs Uzbekistan [/SECTION]
Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan are two neighboring countries in Central Asia, with distinct economic profiles and cost structures. Turkmenistan has a higher GDP per capita, driven by its significant oil and gas reserves, while Uzbekistan has a more diversified economy with a stronger focus on agriculture and manufacturing. In terms of cost of living, Turkmenistan tends to be cheaper than Uzbekistan, with lower prices for housing, food, and transportation. However, Uzbekistan has a more developed tourism infrastructure and a wider range of amenities, which can drive up costs for expats and travelers.

The cost difference between the two countries is significant, with Turkmenistan offering savings of around 15-20% on overall living expenses. This makes Turkmenistan an attractive option for budget-conscious travelers, expats, and students. However, Uzbekistan's more developed economy and tourism infrastructure may make it a better choice for those who prioritize convenience, amenities, and entertainment options. In terms of economic context, both countries are still developing, with significant investments in infrastructure and industry. However, Turkmenistan's economy is more heavily reliant on oil and gas exports, which can make it more vulnerable to fluctuations in global commodity prices.
