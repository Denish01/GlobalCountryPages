[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Turkmenistan has two main international airports, Ashgabat International Airport (ASB) and Turkmenbashi International Airport (KRW), which receive flights from major hubs in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. Direct flights are available from cities like Istanbul, Moscow, and Dubai, while other destinations may require a connection. Overland entry points are also available, with border crossings from neighboring countries like Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, and Iran, although these may be subject to restrictions and require special permits.

Travelers can enter Turkmenistan by land or air, and it is recommended to plan ahead and research the requirements for each entry point. For example, the border crossing from Uzbekistan to Turkmenistan at Dashoguz is a popular route, but it may be closed due to security concerns. It is also important to note that Turkmenistan has strict visa requirements, and travelers may need to obtain a visa in advance or at the airport.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Domestic flights in Turkmenistan are limited, with only a few routes available between major cities like Ashgabat, Turkmenbashi, and Dashoguz. The national carrier, Turkmenistan Airlines, operates most domestic flights, and tickets can be booked in advance through their website or at local travel agencies. Prices are relatively high, with a one-way ticket from Ashgabat to Turkmenbashi costing around $100-$200. It is recommended to book early, as flights may be cancelled or rescheduled due to weather or other conditions.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Turkmenistan's rail network is limited, with only a few routes available, including the main line from Ashgabat to Turkmenbashi and Dashoguz. Trains are generally slow and not very comfortable, but they can be a cheaper option for traveling between cities. There are no high-speed trains in Turkmenistan, and the booking process can be complicated, with tickets often only available at local train stations. Prices are relatively low, with a one-way ticket from Ashgabat to Turkmenbashi costing around $10-$20.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Intercity buses and coaches are available in Turkmenistan, although the quality and frequency of services can vary greatly. Private companies like Gunbatar and Turkmenavtotrans operate buses between major cities, with prices starting from around $5-$10 for a one-way ticket. However, buses may not always be comfortable or reliable, and schedules can be unpredictable. It is recommended to check with local travel agencies or bus stations for the latest information and to book tickets in advance.
