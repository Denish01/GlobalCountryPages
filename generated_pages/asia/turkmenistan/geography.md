[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Turkmenistan is situated in the heart of Central Asia, with its borders stretching across a vast territory. The country shares its borders with four nations: Kazakhstan to the north, Uzbekistan to the northeast, Afghanistan to the southeast, and Iran to the south. The Caspian Sea lies to the west, providing a significant coastline and access to maritime trade routes. The country's strategic location has made it an important hub for trade and cultural exchange between East and West.

The borders of Turkmenistan are largely defined by natural features, such as the Kopet Dag mountain range to the south and the Kyzylkum Desert to the northeast. The country's terrain has played a significant role in shaping its history, with the ancient Silk Road passing through the territory. Today, Turkmenistan's borders are an important factor in its economic and political relationships with its neighbors, with the country seeking to balance its independence with regional cooperation and integration.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Turkmenistan's terrain is characterized by a diverse range of landscapes, from the snow-capped mountains of the Kopet Dag range to the arid expanses of the Karakum Desert. The country's landscape can be broadly divided into three main regions: the mountains, the deserts, and the coastal plain. The Kopet Dag range stretches along the southern border, with peaks reaching elevations of over 2,000 meters. The mountains are home to a range of flora and fauna, including wild tulips, juniper forests, and the rare Persian leopard.

The deserts of Turkmenistan cover much of the country, with the Karakum Desert being the largest. The desert landscape is dominated by sand dunes, salt flats, and oases, with vegetation limited to hardy shrubs and grasses. The coastal plain along the Caspian Sea is a narrow strip of land, with a mix of sandy beaches, salt marshes, and lagoons. The plain is an important habitat for migratory birds and is home to several nature reserves and protected areas.

The Amu Darya and Murghab rivers are the two main rivers in Turkmenistan, flowing through the deserts and supporting agriculture and urban settlements. The rivers are fed by snowmelt from the mountains and are an important source of water for irrigation and drinking water. The country's terrain has been shaped by tectonic activity, with the Kopet Dag range being a relatively young mountain range formed by the collision of the Eurasian and Arabian tectonic plates.
