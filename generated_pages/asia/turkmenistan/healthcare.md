[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in Turkmenistan is a mixed system, with both public and private providers offering medical services. The public healthcare system is universal and provides access to medical care for all citizens, but the quality of care is often **inadequate** due to a lack of resources, outdated equipment, and a shortage of skilled medical professionals. In contrast, private healthcare providers offer higher-quality services, but these are often **unaffordable** for the average citizen. Urban areas, such as the capital Ashgabat, tend to have better access to healthcare services and higher-quality facilities than rural areas, where medical care is often **scarce** and **underequipped**. The Turkmen government has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, including investing in new medical facilities and equipment, but much work remains to be done to address the significant **disparities** in healthcare access and quality.

The quality of care in Turkmenistan is also affected by a lack of **transparency** and **accountability** in the healthcare system. Patients often have to pay **bribes** to receive medical care, and the use of **unlicensed** medical practitioners is common. Additionally, the country has a high **prevalence** of diseases such as **tuberculosis** and **hepatitis**, which can be **deadly** if left untreated. Despite these challenges, there are some **positive trends** in the healthcare system, including an increase in the number of medical professionals and an improvement in the availability of **essential medicines**.

The healthcare system in Turkmenistan is also **heavily centralized**, with the Ministry of Health and Medical Industry responsible for overseeing all aspects of healthcare in the country. This can make it difficult for patients to access medical care, especially in rural areas where there may be a lack of **transportation** options. However, the government has made efforts to **decentralize** some healthcare services, including the establishment of **community health centers** in rural areas.
