[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Turkmenistan is characterized by a mix of modern and traditional housing, with the capital city Ashgabat offering a range of accommodation options. Typical lease terms in Turkmenistan are one to two years, with a deposit requirement of one to three months' rent. Tenant rights are relatively limited, and renters are advised to carefully review their contracts before signing. Compared to regional neighbors, Turkmenistan's housing costs are relatively moderate, with prices lower than in Kazakhstan but higher than in Uzbekistan. The country's unique economic situation, with a strong emphasis on state-controlled industries, can also impact the housing market, with prices and availability influenced by government policies.

The housing market in Turkmenistan is also influenced by the country's cultural and social context, with a strong emphasis on family and community. Many Turkmen people prefer to live in traditional housing, such as **yurts** or **koshks**, which are often located in rural areas. However, modern apartments and houses are becoming increasingly popular, particularly among younger people and expats. The government has also invested in developing new housing complexes and infrastructure, which has helped to increase the availability of modern housing options.
