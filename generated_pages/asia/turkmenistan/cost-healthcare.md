[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Turkmenistan's healthcare system is a mixed model, combining elements of public and private healthcare. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality, with limited resources and outdated equipment, whereas private healthcare facilities offer better quality care, but at a significantly higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only affordable option, while foreigners and those with higher incomes tend to opt for private healthcare. The system works on a fee-for-service basis, with patients typically required to pay out-of-pocket for medical services, although some state-funded programs and social insurance schemes are available to certain groups.

The need for health insurance in Turkmenistan is highly recommended, especially for foreigners and those with pre-existing medical conditions. While the public healthcare system provides basic medical care, it may not be sufficient for complex or specialized treatments. Private health insurance can help cover the high costs of medical care, especially in emergency situations. However, the availability and quality of health insurance plans in Turkmenistan can be limited, and many foreigners opt for international health insurance plans that provide coverage in multiple countries.
