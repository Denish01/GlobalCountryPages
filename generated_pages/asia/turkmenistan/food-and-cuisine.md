[SECTION] Food Culture Overview [/SECTION]
Turkmenistan's cuisine is characterized by its use of meat, particularly lamb and beef, as well as an abundance of rice, flatbread, and vegetables. The country's strategic location at the crossroads of the Silk Road has influenced its culinary traditions, with Uzbek, Kazakh, and Iranian flavors evident in many dishes. Regional variations exist, with the northern region favoring more robust flavors and the southern region incorporating more spices and herbs. The traditional **beshbarmak**, a dish of boiled meat served with noodles and onions, is a staple in many Turkmen households.

Turkmen cuisine is also shaped by its nomadic heritage, with many dishes designed to be simple, nourishing, and easy to prepare over an open flame. The use of **shashlik**, or skewered meat, is a common cooking method, and the smell of sizzling meat is a familiar scent in many Turkmen cities. The country's love of tea, particularly **green tea**, is another defining feature of its food culture, with tea often served at social gatherings and special occasions.

The influence of Soviet-era cuisine is also evident in Turkmenistan, with many dishes incorporating Russian and Ukrainian flavors. The popular **pelmeni**, a type of dumpling filled with meat and served in a broth, is a legacy of this era. Despite these external influences, however, Turkmen cuisine remains distinct and flavorful, with a focus on hearty, comforting dishes that bring people together.
