The public healthcare system is universal and provides access to medical care for all citizens, but the quality of care is often **inadequate** due to a lack of resources, outdated equipment, and a shortage of skilled medical professionals. In contrast, private healthcare providers offer higher-quality services, but these are often **unaffordable** for the average citizen. Urban areas, such as the capital Ashgabat, tend to have better access to healthcare services and higher-quality facilities than rural areas, where medical care is often **scarce** and **underequipped**. The Turkmen government has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, including investing in new medical facilities and equipment, but much work remains to be done to address the significant **disparities** in healthcare access and quality.\n\nThe quality of care in Turkmenistan is also affected by a lack of **transparency** and **accountability** in the healthcare system. Patients often have to pay **bribes** to receive medical care, and the use of **unlicensed** medical practitioners is common. Additionally, the country has a high **prevalence** of diseases such as **tuberculosis** and **hepatitis**, which can be **deadly** if left untreated. Despite these challenges, there are some **positive trends** in the healthcare system, including an increase in the number of medical professionals and an improvement in the availability of **essential medicines**.\n\nThe healthcare system in Turkmenistan is also **heavily centralized**, with the Ministry of Health and Medical Industry responsible for overseeing all aspects of healthcare in the country. This can make it difficult for patients to access medical care, especially in rural areas where there may be a lack of **transportation** options. However, the government has made efforts to **decentralize** some healthcare services, including the establishment of **community health centers** in rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Turkmenistan Central Hospital | Ashgabat | Public | General medicine, surgery, pediatrics | Limited |\n| Ashgabat International Clinic | Ashgabat | Private | General medicine, dentistry, ophthalmology | Yes |\n| Nebitdag Regional Hospital | Balkanabat | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Limited |\n| Mary Regional Hospital | Mary | Public | General medicine, surgery, pediatrics | Limited |\n| Dashoguz Regional Hospital | Dashoguz | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Limited |\n| Yilyaly Medical Center | Ashgabat | Private | General medicine, cardiology, oncology | Yes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Private health insurance** is recommended for foreigners and expats, as it provides access to higher-quality medical care and **emergency evacuation** services if needed.\n- **Local insurance options** are available, but they may not provide the same level of coverage as international insurance plans.\n- **Expats** should research and purchase health insurance that covers them in Turkmenistan, as well as in their home country.\n- **Costs** for medical care can be high, especially for specialized treatments or **emergency services**.\n- **Government insurance** is available for citizens, but it may not provide adequate coverage for all medical needs.\n- **Supplementary insurance** may be necessary to cover **out-of-pocket expenses**, such as **prescriptions** and **medical equipment**.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Medications** are available in major cities, but the selection may be **limited** in rural areas.\n- **Prescription requirements** vary, but some medications may require a **prescription** from a licensed medical professional.\n- **Common brands** of medications may not be available, and **generic alternatives** may be the only option.\n- **Costs** for medications can be high, especially for **imported** or **specialized** medications.\n- **Pharmacy access** is limited in rural areas, and patients may have to travel to urban areas to access **essential medicines**.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Hepatitis A** and **hepatitis B** vaccinations are recommended for all travelers to Turkmenistan.\n- **Rabies** vaccination is recommended for travelers who will be spending time in rural areas or working with animals.\n- **Tuberculosis** is a significant health risk in Turkmenistan, and travelers should take precautions to avoid **infection**.\n- **Water safety** is a concern, and travelers should only drink **bottled** or **filtered** water.\n- **Food safety** is also a concern, and travelers should only eat **cooked** or **peeled** foods to avoid **gastrointestinal illness**.\n- **Insect-borne illnesses**, such as **malaria** and **tick-borne encephalitis**, are present in some areas of the country.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **Medical tourism** is not a significant industry in Turkmenistan, but some private clinics and hospitals may offer specialized medical services to foreigners.\n- **Popular procedures** may include **dentistry**, **ophthalmology**, and **cosmetic surgery**.\n- **Accredited hospitals** may offer high-quality medical care, but patients should research and verify the credentials of any medical facility before seeking treatment.\n- **Cost savings** may be available for some medical procedures, but patients should carefully consider the **risks** and **benefits** of seeking medical care in Turkmenistan.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- In the event of an **emergency**, patients should call the **emergency number** (03) for assistance.\n- **Ambulance reliability** is a concern, and patients may need to arrange for **private transportation** to a medical facility.\n- **Nearest hospitals** may be located in urban areas, and patients may need to travel long distances to access medical care.\n- **Insurance claims** should be filed promptly, and patients should keep detailed records of their medical expenses and treatment.\n- **Emergency evacuation** services may be necessary in severe cases, and patients should research and purchase insurance that covers this option.",
