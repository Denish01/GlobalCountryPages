The country's strategic location at the crossroads of the Silk Road has influenced its culinary traditions, with Uzbek, Kazakh, and Iranian flavors evident in many dishes. Regional variations exist, with the northern region favoring more robust flavors and the southern region incorporating more spices and herbs. The traditional **beshbarmak**, a dish of boiled meat served with noodles and onions, is a staple in many Turkmen households.\n\nTurkmen cuisine is also shaped by its nomadic heritage, with many dishes designed to be simple, nourishing, and easy to prepare over an open flame. The use of **shashlik**, or skewered meat, is a common cooking method, and the smell of sizzling meat is a familiar scent in many Turkmen cities. The country's love of tea, particularly **green tea**, is another defining feature of its food culture, with tea often served at social gatherings and special occasions.\n\nThe influence of Soviet-era cuisine is also evident in Turkmenistan, with many dishes incorporating Russian and Ukrainian flavors. The popular **pelmeni**, a type of dumpling filled with meat and served in a broth, is a legacy of this era. Despite these external influences, however, Turkmen cuisine remains distinct and flavorful, with a focus on hearty, comforting dishes that bring people together.\n\n[SECTION] Must-Try Dishes [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Dish | Type | Description | Where to Find |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Plov | main course | hearty rice dish made with meat, onions, and carrots | traditional restaurants in Ashgabat |\n| Shashlik | main course | skewered meat (usually lamb or beef) | street food stalls and markets |\n| Shurpa | soup | hearty soup made with meat, vegetables, and noodles | local eateries and food courts |\n| Manty | main course | steamed dumplings filled with meat and onions | traditional restaurants and food stalls |\n| Kuurdak | main course | boiled meat dish served with potatoes and onions | family gatherings and special occasions |\n| Beshbarmak | main course | boiled meat served with noodles and onions | traditional restaurants and family gatherings |\n| Gormeh | main course | stew made with meat, vegetables, and herbs | local eateries and food courts |\n| Chak-Chak | dessert | sweet pastry made with honey and nuts | bakeries and cafes in Ashgabat |\n| Shashlyk-Kebab | main course | skewered meat (usually lamb or beef) served with flatbread | street food stalls and markets |\n| Kibinai | pastry | flaky pastry filled with meat and onions | bakeries and cafes in Ashgabat |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Street Food & Snacks [/SECTION]\n- Shashlik (skewered meat): $1-2 USD per skewer\n- Somsa (meat or onion pastry): $0.50-1 USD per piece\n- Flatbread with cheese or meat: $1-2 USD per piece\n- Fresh fruit (such as apricots or grapes): $1-2 USD per kilogram\n- Roasted nuts (such as almonds or walnuts): $2-3 USD per kilogram\n- Kibinai (flaky pastry filled with meat or onions): $1-2 USD per piece\n\n[SECTION] Drinks [/SECTION]\n- **Cha** (green tea): a staple in Turkmen culture, often served at social gatherings\n- **Kefir** (yogurt drink): a refreshing and healthy beverage\n- **Kompot** (fruit drink): a sweet and flavorful drink made with fruit and berries\n- **Turkmen beer**: a local beer brewed in Ashgabat\n- **Vodka**: a popular spirit often consumed at social gatherings\n- **Juice** (such as pomegranate or apricot): a sweet and refreshing beverage\n\n[SECTION] Dining Customs [/SECTION]\n- Table manners: use your right hand when eating, as the left hand is considered unclean\n- Tipping: 5-10% of the total bill is customary\n- Reservations: not always necessary, but recommended for popular restaurants\n- Dress code: modest dress is recommended, especially when visiting traditional restaurants\n- Eating etiquette: wait for the host to invite you to sit and start eating\n\n[SECTION] Where to Eat [/SECTION]\n- **Traditional restaurants**: offering a range of local dishes and a cozy atmosphere\n- **Food courts**: a great place to try a variety of street foods and snacks\n- **Markets**: offering fresh produce, meats, and dairy products\n- **Cafes**: serving a range of coffee, tea, and pastries\n- **Street food stalls**: offering a quick and affordable meal on the go\n\n[SECTION] Food Markets & Food Experiences [/SECTION]\n- **Ashgabat Market**: a bustling market offering a range of fresh produce, meats, and dairy products\n- **Gulistan Market**: a smaller market specializing in traditional handicrafts and souvenirs\n- **Turkmenbashi Fish Market**: a bustling market offering a range of fresh seafood\n- **Darvaza Gas Crater**: a unique food experience, with many restaurants and food stalls offering traditional dishes and snacks\n- **Mary Bazaar**: a historic market offering a range of traditional goods and souvenirs",
