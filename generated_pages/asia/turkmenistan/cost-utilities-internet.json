  "content": "The cost of utilities and internet in Turkmenistan can vary depending on the location, usage, and provider, but on average, a monthly utility bill for an 85 sqm apartment can range from $50 to $150 USD.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Utilities (85 sqm apt): ($100 USD)\nInternet (60 Mbps): ($30 USD/month)\nMobile Data (10GB): ($10 USD/month)\nElectricity Cost: ($0.08 per kWh)\nCurrency: TMT\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nTurkmenistan's utility infrastructure is relatively underdeveloped, with frequent power outages and water shortages reported in some areas. The cost of utilities can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher costs during the winter months due to increased demand for heating. The government has implemented measures to improve the utility infrastructure, including investments in renewable energy and grid modernization. However, the cost of utilities remains a significant burden for many households, with the average household spending around 10-15% of their income on utilities.\n\nThe quality of utility services in Turkmenistan varies depending on the location, with urban areas tend to have better access to reliable utilities than rural areas. The government has implemented a system of subsidies to help low-income households pay for their utility bills, but the effectiveness of this system is limited. As a result, many households rely on alternative sources of energy, such as propane or coal, which can be hazardous to health and the environment.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Water | $10 | $15 | $20 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $15 | $25 | $35 | |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $5 | $10 | $15 | (included in rent in some cases) |\n| **Total** | **$50** | **$80** | **$110** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $20-30 | 10 Mbps | TM Cell, Altyn Asyr |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $50-70 | 100 Mbps | TM Cell, Altyn Asyr |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $5-10 | 1 GB | TM Cell, MTS |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $10-20 | 5 GB | TM Cell, MTS |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $30-50 | varies | TM Cell, Altyn Asyr |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (limited content available) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities, you will typically need to provide proof of residency and identification, and pay a deposit to the utility provider.\n- Prepaid electricity meters are available, which can help households budget their energy usage and avoid surprise bills.\n- The best internet providers in Turkmenistan are TM Cell and Altyn Asyr, which offer relatively fast and reliable connections.\n- To save on utility bills, households can take measures such as using energy-efficient appliances, insulating their homes, and using public transportation.\n- It is also a good idea to negotiate with your landlord or utility provider to see if you can get a better rate or bundle deal on your utilities and internet services.",
