[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Turkmenistan is a country with a diverse climate, ranging from the hot and dry deserts of the Karakum to the mild and temperate regions of the Kopet Dag mountains. The country experiences a dry season from April to October, with very little rainfall, and a wet season from November to March, with most of the rainfall occurring in the winter months. The extreme temperatures and lack of rainfall make the summer months challenging for travel, while the winter months can be cold and wet. The spring and autumn months, on the other hand, offer a pleasant climate, making them the best time to visit Turkmenistan.

The climate in Turkmenistan is also influenced by its geographical location, with the country being landlocked and surrounded by mountains. The temperature variations between day and night can be significant, especially in the desert regions. The best time to visit Turkmenistan's deserts is during the spring and autumn months, when the temperatures are mild and the sun is not too intense. The mountains, on the other hand, are best visited during the summer months, when the weather is warm and the trekking conditions are ideal.

The seasons in Turkmenistan also affect the travel conditions, with the summer months being the peak tourist season. The cities, such as Ashgabat, can be crowded and hot, while the deserts can be challenging to navigate due to the extreme heat. The winter months, on the other hand, can be quiet and peaceful, but the cold weather and lack of tourist infrastructure can make travel difficult.
