  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Turkmenistan can vary significantly, with an average health expenditure per capita of $581, and out-of-pocket expenses accounting for 77.4% of total healthcare spending.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $581\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 77.4%\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 03\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: TMT\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nTurkmenistan's healthcare system is a mixed model, combining elements of public and private healthcare. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality, with limited resources and outdated equipment, whereas private healthcare facilities offer better quality care, but at a significantly higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only affordable option, while foreigners and those with higher incomes tend to opt for private healthcare. The system works on a fee-for-service basis, with patients typically required to pay out-of-pocket for medical services, although some state-funded programs and social insurance schemes are available to certain groups.\n\nThe need for health insurance in Turkmenistan is highly recommended, especially for foreigners and those with pre-existing medical conditions. While the public healthcare system provides basic medical care, it may not be sufficient for complex or specialized treatments. Private health insurance can help cover the high costs of medical care, especially in emergency situations. However, the availability and quality of health insurance plans in Turkmenistan can be limited, and many foreigners opt for international health insurance plans that provide coverage in multiple countries.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $5-10 | $20-50 | Prices vary by city and doctor's qualifications |\n| Specialist Consultation | $10-20 | $50-100 | Prices depend on the specialist's field and experience |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-20 | $30-70 | Prices vary by dentist's qualifications and location |\n| Eye Exam | $5-10 | $20-50 | Prices depend on the type of exam and equipment used |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $5-10 | $20-50 | Prices vary by laboratory and test complexity |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $20-50 | Prices depend on the hospital and severity of the condition |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $50-100 | Prices vary by hospital and room type |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-1,000 | Prices depend on the type of surgery and surgeon's fees |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $500-1,000 | Prices vary by hospital and obstetrician's fees |\n| MRI Scan | $100-200 | Prices depend on the hospital and equipment used |\n| X-Ray | $10-20 | Prices vary by hospital and type of X-ray |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-50 | Outpatient care, basic hospitalization, and emergency services |\n| Comprehensive Private | $50-100 | Inpatient and outpatient care, specialist consultations, and diagnostic tests |\n| International / Expat | $100-200 | Global coverage, including evacuation and repatriation services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Common medications such as **antibiotics** and **pain relievers** can cost between $5-10 per prescription.\n- **Prescription rules** in Turkmenistan require a doctor's prescription for most medications, although some over-the-counter medications are available.\n- **Pharmacy availability** is generally good in urban areas, with many pharmacies open 24/7.\n- **Over-the-counter norms** allow for the purchase of basic medications such as **cold and flu remedies** without a prescription.\n- The cost of **specialized medications** such as **insulin** or **asthma inhalers** can range from $20-50 per prescription.\n- Some **pharmacies** may offer discounts for bulk purchases or loyalty programs.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the local emergency number, 03, or seek immediate attention at the nearest hospital. **Ambulance services** are available, but may not be readily accessible in rural areas.
