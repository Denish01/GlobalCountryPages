However, the country's economy is largely driven by the government, and the cost of living can vary greatly depending on the city and lifestyle. A budget of $600-700 per month can provide a basic but comfortable life, with shared accommodation, cooking at home, and using public transportation. A mid-range lifestyle with a budget of $1,200-1,500 per month can offer more comfort, with a one-bedroom apartment in the city center, eating out occasionally, and using taxis or cars. A comfortable lifestyle with a budget of $2,500-3,000 per month can provide a high level of comfort, with a nice two-bedroom apartment, eating out often, and using private transportation.\n\nCompared to neighboring countries, Turkmenistan's cost of living is relatively high, but still lower than in Kazakhstan and Iran. However, the country's unique culture and history, as well as its natural beauty, make it an attractive destination for tourists and expats. The cost of living in Turkmenistan can be affected by the country's import-dependent economy, which can lead to fluctuations in prices. Additionally, the government's control over the economy and the limited availability of certain goods and services can also impact the cost of living.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Breakdown [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Category | Budget ($) | Mid-Range ($) | Comfortable ($) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rent (1BR apartment) | 150-200 | 300-400 | 600-800 | (budget=shared/outside, mid=1BR center, comfortable=nice 2BR) |\n| Food & Groceries | 100-150 | 200-300 | 400-500 | (budget=cook mostly, mid=mix, comfortable=eat out often) |\n| Transportation | 20-50 | 50-100 | 100-200 | (budget=public only, mid=mix, comfortable=taxi/car) |\n| Utilities & Internet | 50-100 | 100-150 | 150-250 | (electricity, water, internet, phone) |\n| Healthcare / Insurance | 20-50 | 50-100 | 100-200 | (budget=public only, comfortable=private) |\n| Entertainment & Social | 50-100 | 100-200 | 200-300 | (going out, hobbies, gym) |\n| Clothing & Personal | 20-50 | 50-100 | 100-200 |  |\n| Savings / Misc | 50-100 | 100-200 | 200-300 |  |\n| **Total** | **600-700** | **1,200-1,500** | **2,500-3,000** |  |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Budget Tier Lifestyles [/SECTION]\nA budget lifestyle in Turkmenistan can provide a basic but comfortable life, with shared accommodation, cooking at home, and using public transportation.
