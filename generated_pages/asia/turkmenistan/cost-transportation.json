The country's capital, Ashgabat, has a more comprehensive network of buses and minibuses, but the quality of public transit can be inconsistent. In rural areas, transportation options are limited, and many people rely on **shared taxis** or **minibuses** to travel between cities.\n\nThe government has invested in improving the country's transportation infrastructure, including the construction of new roads and highways. However, the lack of a well-developed public transportation system can make it difficult for tourists and locals alike to get around, especially in rural areas. Despite these challenges, the country's unique cultural heritage and natural beauty make it an attractive destination for travelers, and many are willing to navigate the transportation system to experience all that Turkmenistan has to offer.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.20-$0.50 | $10-$15 | Limited coverage, inconsistent schedules |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $1-$3 | N/A | Limited routes, often crowded |\n| Commuter Train | $5-$10 | $50-$100 | Limited routes, mostly used for freight |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $3-$5 | $1-$2 | $10-$20 | Limited availability, often negotiate fare |\n| Ride-Hailing App | N/A | N/A | N/A | Some local alternatives, but not widely available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$50 | Private transfer or taxi, negotiated fare |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $0.60 | State-controlled prices |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $0.50 | State-controlled prices |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $50-$100 | Economy car, limited availability |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-$2 | Limited parking options, often free |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $5-$10 | Limited toll roads, mostly for highways |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$30 | Limited routes, often crowded |\n| Domestic Flight | $50-$200 | Limited routes, mostly state-controlled |\n| Train (long-distance) | $20-$50 | Limited routes, mostly used for freight |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider using **shared taxis** or **minibuses** for shorter trips.\n- Negotiate the fare with taxi drivers before starting your journey, as meters are not always used.\n- Be aware of your surroundings and keep an eye on your belongings, especially in crowded public transportation.\n- Consider renting a **private car** for longer trips or for more flexibility in your travel plans.\n- Use local **currency (TMT)** for transportation costs, as not all providers accept USD.\n- Be prepared for limited **English language** support among transportation providers, and consider learning basic **Turkmen phrases** to help navigate.",
