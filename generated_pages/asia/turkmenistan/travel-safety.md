[SECTION] Overall Safety Assessment [/SECTION]
Turkmenistan is a relatively safe country, with low rates of petty and violent crime. However, the country's authoritarian government and limited freedoms can create an atmosphere of tension and mistrust. Travelers should be aware of their surroundings and avoid engaging in any behavior that could be perceived as threatening or subversive. Additionally, the country's lack of transparency and limited access to information can make it difficult for travelers to stay informed about local conditions and potential risks.

Despite these challenges, many travelers visit Turkmenistan without incident, and the country has a lot to offer in terms of culture, history, and natural beauty. The government has taken steps to improve tourist infrastructure and services, and many locals are friendly and welcoming to visitors. However, travelers should still exercise caution and take necessary precautions to ensure their safety, particularly when traveling outside of major cities or engaging in activities that may be considered sensitive or restricted.
