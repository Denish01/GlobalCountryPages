[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Turkmenistan operates a **territorial taxation** system, where tax is levied on income earned within the country, regardless of the taxpayer's residency status. However, **worldwide taxation** applies to residents, who are taxed on their global income, with foreign-earned income subject to taxation in Turkmenistan. To be considered a tax resident, an individual must have a permanent home in Turkmenistan or spend more than 183 days in the country within a 12-month period. The tax system is administered by the Ministry of Finance and Economy, which is responsible for collecting taxes, enforcing tax laws, and providing tax-related services to taxpayers.

The tax system in Turkmenistan is designed to promote economic growth and development, with a focus on encouraging foreign investment and trade. The government has implemented various tax incentives and exemptions to attract businesses and individuals to the country. For example, foreign investors are exempt from paying taxes on profits for a certain period, and companies operating in free economic zones are eligible for reduced tax rates. Additionally, the government has established a number of tax-free zones, including the Turkmenbashi Free Economic Zone, which offers a range of tax and customs incentives to businesses operating in the zone.
