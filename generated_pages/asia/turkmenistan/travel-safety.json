However, the country's authoritarian government and limited freedoms can create an atmosphere of tension and mistrust. Travelers should be aware of their surroundings and avoid engaging in any behavior that could be perceived as threatening or subversive. Additionally, the country's lack of transparency and limited access to information can make it difficult for travelers to stay informed about local conditions and potential risks.\n\nDespite these challenges, many travelers visit Turkmenistan without incident, and the country has a lot to offer in terms of culture, history, and natural beauty. The government has taken steps to improve tourist infrastructure and services, and many locals are friendly and welcoming to visitors. However, travelers should still exercise caution and take necessary precautions to ensure their safety, particularly when traveling outside of major cities or engaging in activities that may be considered sensitive or restricted.\n\n[SECTION] Safety By Area [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area/Region | Safety Level | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Ashgabat | High | Well-patrolled and safe, but avoid taking photos of government buildings or military personnel |\n| Mary | Medium | Some petty crime and scams reported, but generally safe for tourists |\n| Turkmenabat | Medium | Limited tourist infrastructure, but relatively safe for travelers |\n| Darvaza | High | Remote area, but generally safe for tourists visiting the gas crater |\n| Caspian Coast | Low | Limited access and some reports of crime and corruption |\n| Afghanistan border | Low | Avoid traveling near the border due to risk of violence and instability |\n| Uzbekistan border | Medium | Some reports of crime and corruption, but generally safe for travelers |\n| Karakum Desert | Medium | Remote area, but generally safe for tourists with guided tours |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Common Risks & Scams [/SECTION]\n- Be cautious of **bribery** and **corruption**, particularly when dealing with government officials or law enforcement\n- Avoid carrying large amounts of cash, as **pickpocketing** and **theft** can occur in crowded areas\n- Be wary of **scams** targeting tourists, such as overpriced tours or fake souvenir shops\n- Avoid taking **unofficial taxis** or **unlicensed guides**, as they may be untrustworthy or even connected to organized crime\n- Be careful when using **ATMs** or **credit cards**, as there have been reports of **skimming** and **fraud**\n- Avoid **photographing** sensitive areas, such as government buildings or military personnel, as this can be considered a security threat\n\n[SECTION] Health & Medical [/SECTION]\n- **Vaccinations:** Hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and typhoid fever are recommended, and **rabies** vaccination is required for travelers who plan to spend time outdoors or around animals\n- **Water Safety:** Tap water is not safe to drink, and **bottled water** is recommended\n- **Medical Facilities:** Medical facilities are limited, particularly outside of major cities, and **travel insurance** that includes medical evacuation is recommended\n- **Pharmacy Access:** Pharmacy access is limited, and **medications** may not always be available\n\n[SECTION] Practical Safety Tips [/SECTION]\n- Register with your government's travel advisory program to receive updates on safety and security conditions\n- Stay informed about local conditions and potential risks through reputable sources, such as your government's travel advisory website\n- Avoid traveling alone at night, particularly in rural areas\n- Keep valuables secure and consider using a **money belt** or **hotel safe**\n- Be respectful of local customs and traditions, particularly when visiting mosques or other cultural sites\n- Avoid **photographing** people without their permission, as this can be considered impolite or even threatening\n- Stay hydrated and take necessary precautions to avoid **heat stroke** and **dehydration**, particularly when traveling in the desert\n\n[SECTION] For Solo & Women Travelers [/SECTION]\n- Be prepared for **harassment** or **catcalls**, particularly in crowded areas or from taxi drivers\n- Dress **modestly** and avoid revealing clothing, particularly when visiting cultural sites or interacting with locals\n- Consider traveling with a **guided tour** or **reputable agency** to ensure safety and security\n- Avoid traveling alone at night, and consider staying in **well-lit** and **secure** areas\n- Keep in touch with family and friends back home, and consider registering with your government's travel advisory program to receive updates on safety and security conditions",
