[SECTION] How Turkmenistan Is Divided [/SECTION]
Turkmenistan's administrative structure is divided into five provinces, or welayats, and the capital city, Ashgabat. Each province has its own capital city and is further divided into districts, or etraps. The provinces are Ahal, Balkan, Dashoguz, Lebap, and Mary, and they are responsible for managing their own local affairs, such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure. The capital city, Ashgabat, is a separate entity and is governed directly by the central government.
