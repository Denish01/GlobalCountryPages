[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Turkmenistan is highly centralized, with the government playing a significant role in determining the curriculum and education policies. Public education is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to private education, with limited resources and outdated teaching methods. The language of instruction is primarily **Turkmen**, although some schools may offer instruction in **Russian** or **English**. Compulsory education lasts for 12 years, from age 6 to 18, and is divided into primary, secondary, and higher education.
