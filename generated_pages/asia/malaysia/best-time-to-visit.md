[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Malaysia is a tropical country with a **tropical rainforest climate**, characterized by high temperatures and high humidity levels throughout the year. The country can be divided into two main climate zones: the **east coast** and the **west coast**. The east coast, which includes states such as Kelantan and Terengganu, experiences a **monsoon season** from November to March, with heavy rainfall and strong winds. The west coast, which includes states such as Penang and Selangor, experiences a **dry season** from December to February, with minimal rainfall and sunny weather. The dry season is the best time to visit Malaysia, as the weather is ideal for outdoor activities such as hiking, diving, and exploring the country's many **national parks** and **islands**.

The monsoon season, on the other hand, can be challenging for travelers, as the heavy rainfall and strong winds can make it difficult to get around and enjoy the country's many outdoor attractions. However, the monsoon season also brings its own unique benefits, such as the opportunity to see the country's **waterfalls** and **rivers** in full flow, and to experience the **local festivals** and **cultural events** that take place during this time. Overall, the best time to visit Malaysia depends on your personal preferences and what you want to do during your trip.

The seasons in Malaysia also affect the **crowd levels** and **prices** of accommodations and tourist attractions. During the peak season, which typically falls in December and January, the country is bustling with tourists, and prices for accommodations and tourist attractions are at their highest. During the off-season, which typically falls in April and May, the country is less crowded, and prices are lower, making it a good time to visit for budget-conscious travelers.
