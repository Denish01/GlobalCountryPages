The country's population is projected to reach 42 million by 2030, driven by a combination of natural increase and migration. Urbanization is a significant trend in Malaysia, with more than three-quarters of the population living in urban areas, particularly in the Klang Valley region surrounding Kuala Lumpur. The country's population is also becoming increasingly mobile, with many Malaysians migrating to urban areas in search of better job opportunities and higher living standards.\n\nThe population growth rate in Malaysia has been influenced by factors such as improvements in healthcare, education, and economic development. However, the country also faces challenges related to population aging, with a significant increase in the proportion of elderly citizens expected in the coming decades. This demographic shift will have implications for Malaysia's social security system, healthcare services, and labor market.\n\nMalaysia's population is also characterized by a significant proportion of migrant workers, with many foreigners employed in sectors such as construction, manufacturing, and services. The country's migration policies have been designed to balance the need for labor with concerns about national security, social cohesion, and human rights.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Malay | 50.8% | Peninsular Malaysia, East Malaysia | Dominant ethnic group, culturally and linguistically |\n| Chinese | 23.8% | Urban areas, particularly in Peninsular Malaysia | Significant economic and cultural influence |\n| Indigenous | 11.8% | East Malaysia, particularly in Sabah and Sarawak | Diverse groups with distinct languages and customs |\n| Indian | 7.1% | Urban areas, particularly in Peninsular Malaysia | Significant cultural and economic contributions |\n| Kadazan-Dusun | 3.4% | Sabah, East Malaysia | Indigenous group with distinct language and customs |\n| Iban | 2.5% | Sarawak, East Malaysia | Indigenous group with distinct language and customs |\n| Bidayuh | 1.4% | Sarawak, East Malaysia | Indigenous group with distinct language and customs |\n\nMalaysia's ethnic diversity is a significant aspect of its national identity, with different groups contributing to the country's cultural, economic, and social fabric.
