[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Malaysia's healthcare system is a mix of public and private providers, with the public sector providing universal access to healthcare for all citizens. The public healthcare system is funded by the government and provides comprehensive healthcare services, including preventive, curative, and rehabilitative care. The private sector, on the other hand, offers high-quality healthcare services, often with shorter waiting times and more personalized care. The quality of care in Malaysia is generally excellent, with many public and private hospitals accredited by international organizations such as the Joint Commission International (JCI). However, access to healthcare can be limited in rural areas, where the availability of medical facilities and specialized care may be limited.

The Malaysian government has implemented various initiatives to improve the healthcare system, including the introduction of the **National Health Financing Scheme**, which aims to provide universal access to healthcare for all citizens. The government has also invested in the development of **telemedicine** services, which enable patients to access medical care remotely, particularly in rural areas. Additionally, the government has established a network of **community clinics**, which provide primary healthcare services to rural communities.

In terms of healthcare costs, Malaysia has a relatively low cost of living, making it an attractive destination for medical tourism and expatriates. However, healthcare costs can still be high, particularly in private hospitals, and **health insurance** is highly recommended to cover unexpected medical expenses.
