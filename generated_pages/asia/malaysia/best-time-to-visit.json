Peak season: December to January. Budget season: April to May. Avoid: November to March and September to November, due to the monsoon season and potential flooding. [/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]\nMalaysia is a tropical country with a **tropical rainforest climate**, characterized by high temperatures and high humidity levels throughout the year. The country can be divided into two main climate zones: the **east coast** and the **west coast**.

The dry season is the best time to visit Malaysia, as the weather is ideal for outdoor activities such as hiking, diving, and exploring the country's many **national parks** and **islands**.\n\nThe monsoon season, on the other hand, can be challenging for travelers, as the heavy rainfall and strong winds can make it difficult to get around and enjoy the country's many outdoor attractions.

Overall, the best time to visit Malaysia depends on your personal preferences and what you want to do during your trip.\n\nThe seasons in Malaysia also affect the **crowd levels** and **prices** of accommodations and tourist attractions. During the peak season, which typically falls in December and January, the country is bustling with tourists, and prices for accommodations and tourist attractions are at their highest.
