  "content": "Malaysia's infrastructure is well-developed, with a strong focus on transportation, energy, and telecommunications, catering to its growing population and economy.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 100% of population\nInternet Penetration: 84.2%\nRoad Network: 238,823 km, with good quality highways and moderate quality rural roads\nRail Network: 2,783 km\nMajor Airports: 8 international, 16 domestic\nMajor Ports: 7 major\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nMalaysia has made significant investments in its infrastructure in recent years, with a focus on improving the country's transportation network, increasing energy production, and expanding access to telecommunications. The country's infrastructure development is driven by its **Economic Transformation Programme**, which aims to turn Malaysia into a high-income nation by 2025. However, there is still a notable gap between urban and rural areas, with rural areas often lacking access to basic amenities such as clean water and sanitation. The government has implemented various initiatives to address this gap, including the **National Rural Development Policy**, which aims to improve the quality of life for rural communities.\n\nMalaysia's infrastructure development is also driven by its strategic location, which makes it an important hub for trade and commerce in Southeast Asia. The country's **multimodal transportation network**, which includes roads, railways, airports, and seaports, facilitates the movement of goods and people, both domestically and internationally. However, the country still faces challenges such as traffic congestion, particularly in urban areas, and the need to upgrade its infrastructure to meet the demands of a growing population and economy.\n\nThe Malaysian government has also implemented various initiatives to promote **sustainable development** and reduce the country's carbon footprint. For example, the government has set a target to increase the share of **renewable energy** in the country's energy mix to 20% by 2025. The government has also implemented policies to promote energy efficiency and reduce energy consumption, such as the **National Energy Efficiency Action Plan**.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 238,823 km | Good | Well-maintained highways, moderate quality rural roads |\n| Railways | 2,783 km | Moderate | Mostly single-track, with some double-tracking |\n| Airports | 8 international, 16 domestic | Good | Modern facilities, with some congestion issues |\n| Ports | 7 major | Good | Well-equipped, with some capacity constraints |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- Malaysia's power generation is largely based on **natural gas** and **coal**, with a growing share of **renewable energy** sources such as solar and biomass.\n- The country's **energy grid** is relatively reliable, with some occasional outages due to maintenance or extreme weather events.\n- The government has set a target to increase the share of renewable energy in the energy mix to **20% by 2025**.\n- Malaysia is also exploring the development of **nuclear energy**, with plans to build its first nuclear power plant in the near future.\n- The country has implemented various initiatives to promote **energy efficiency**, such as the **National Energy Efficiency Action Plan**, which aims to reduce energy consumption by 10% by 2025.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water** is generally safe to drink in urban areas, but may not be reliable in rural areas.\n- **Sanitation coverage** is relatively high, with over 90% of the population having access to improved sanitation facilities.\n- However, there are still some areas, particularly in rural communities, where **water access** is limited, and sanitation facilities are inadequate.\n- The government has implemented various initiatives to improve **water management**, such as the **National Water Resources Policy**, which aims to ensure sustainable management of the country's water resources.\n- Malaysia is also investing in **wastewater treatment** infrastructure, with plans to increase the share of treated wastewater to 100% by 2025.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is widespread, with over 90% of the population having access to mobile phone services.\n- **Fiber-optic broadband** is available in many urban areas, with some rural areas still relying on **copper-based** or **satellite** connections.\n- The government has launched initiatives to promote **4G/5G rollout**, with plans to achieve nationwide coverage by 2025.\n- **Postal services** are relatively reliable, with a wide network of post offices and delivery services.\n- Malaysia is also investing in **digital infrastructure**, such as **data centers** and **cloud computing** services, to support the growth of its digital economy.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The **East Coast Rail Link** project, which aims to connect the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia to the west coast, is currently under construction, with a planned completion date of 2026.\n- The **Pan Borneo Highway** project, which aims to upgrade the highway network in Sabah and Sarawak, is also underway, with a planned completion date of 2025.\n- The **Malaysia-Singapore High-Speed Rail** project, which aims to connect Kuala Lumpur to Singapore, is currently on hold due to funding issues, but is expected to resume construction in the near future.\n- The government has also launched initiatives to promote **green infrastructure**, such as the **Green Technology Master Plan**, which aims to reduce the country's carbon footprint and promote sustainable development.\n- Malaysia is also investing in **transport infrastructure**, such as **airports** and **seaports**, to support the growth of its tourism and trade sectors.",
