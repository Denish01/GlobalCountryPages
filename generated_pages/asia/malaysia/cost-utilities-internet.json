The cost of utilities in Malaysia can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher electricity costs during the summer months due to increased air conditioning usage. The Malaysian government has implemented measures to stabilize utility costs, including subsidies for low-income households and price controls on essential goods. However, the overall cost of utilities in Malaysia is still relatively high compared to other countries in the region.\n\nThe quality of utility infrastructure in Malaysia is generally good, with most households having access to reliable electricity, water, and sanitation services. However, there may be occasional disruptions to services due to maintenance or natural disasters. The cost of utilities can also vary depending on the location, with urban areas tend to have higher costs than rural areas.
