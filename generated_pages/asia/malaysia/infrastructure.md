[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Malaysia has made significant investments in its infrastructure in recent years, with a focus on improving the country's transportation network, increasing energy production, and expanding access to telecommunications. The country's infrastructure development is driven by its **Economic Transformation Programme**, which aims to turn Malaysia into a high-income nation by 2025. However, there is still a notable gap between urban and rural areas, with rural areas often lacking access to basic amenities such as clean water and sanitation. The government has implemented various initiatives to address this gap, including the **National Rural Development Policy**, which aims to improve the quality of life for rural communities.

Malaysia's infrastructure development is also driven by its strategic location, which makes it an important hub for trade and commerce in Southeast Asia. The country's **multimodal transportation network**, which includes roads, railways, airports, and seaports, facilitates the movement of goods and people, both domestically and internationally. However, the country still faces challenges such as traffic congestion, particularly in urban areas, and the need to upgrade its infrastructure to meet the demands of a growing population and economy.

The Malaysian government has also implemented various initiatives to promote **sustainable development** and reduce the country's carbon footprint. For example, the government has set a target to increase the share of **renewable energy** in the country's energy mix to 20% by 2025. The government has also implemented policies to promote energy efficiency and reduce energy consumption, such as the **National Energy Efficiency Action Plan**.
