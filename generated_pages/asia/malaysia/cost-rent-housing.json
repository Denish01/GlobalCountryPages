Typical lease terms range from 6-24 months, with a 2-3 month deposit required. Tenants have rights protected under the Malaysian law, including the right to a written tenancy agreement and protection against unfair eviction. Compared to its regional neighbors, Malaysia's housing costs are relatively moderate, with prices lower than in Singapore but higher than in Indonesia or Thailand. The country's housing market is also influenced by government policies, such as the National Housing Policy, which aims to provide affordable housing for all Malaysians.\n\nThe rental market in Malaysia is also affected by the country's economic conditions, with the current inflation rate of 1.8% and GDP per capita of $38,779. The government's efforts to increase the supply of affordable housing and regulate the rental market have helped to keep prices in check. However, the demand for housing, particularly in urban areas, continues to drive up prices. Expats and foreigners can expect to find a wide range of housing options, from modern apartments to traditional houses, with varying prices depending on the location and amenities.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $200-$400 | $150-$300 | compact, basic amenities |\n| 1 Bedroom | $250-$500 | $200-$400 | modern, fully furnished |\n| 2 Bedroom | $400-$800 | $300-$600 | family size, amenities like pool and gym |\n| 3 Bedroom | $600-$1,200 | $500-$1,000 | spacious, luxury amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $2,500-$5,000 | prime locations, modern amenities |\n| Suburbs | $1,500-$3,000 | residential areas, family-friendly |\n| Rural | $500-$1,500 | natural surroundings, limited amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- Bangsar, Kuala Lumpur: $300-$600 USD/month, trendy, upscale neighborhood with modern amenities\n- Mont Kiara, Kuala Lumpur: $400-$800 USD/month, popular with expats, international schools and amenities\n- Damansara Heights, Kuala Lumpur: $350-$700 USD/month, family-friendly, convenient access to city center\n- Petaling Jaya, Selangor: $250-$500 USD/month, suburban area with a mix of old and new housing\n- Georgetown, Penang: $200-$400 USD/month, historic neighborhood with a mix of old and new housing\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Malaysia [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods and prices before starting your housing search\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent to find suitable options\n- Inspect the property carefully before signing a tenancy agreement\n- Negotiate the rent and terms of the agreement if possible\n- Be aware of scams, such as fake listings or agents demanding upfront fees\n- Utilities like electricity and water are usually not included in the rent, but internet and TV may be included in some cases\n- Furnished apartments are common, but unfurnished options are also available, especially for longer-term rentals",
