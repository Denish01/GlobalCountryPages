[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Malaysia is a country located in Southeast Asia, comprising two landmasses: Peninsular Malaysia and East Malaysia. Peninsular Malaysia is situated on the Malay Peninsula, bordered by Thailand to the north and Singapore to the south. East Malaysia, on the other hand, is located on the island of Borneo, sharing borders with Indonesia and Brunei. The country is surrounded by the South China Sea to the east, the Sulu Sea to the northeast, and the Strait of Malacca to the west. Malaysia's strategic location has made it an important hub for trade and cultural exchange between East Asia and the Indian subcontinent.

Malaysia's borders with its neighboring countries are a result of its complex history, with the country having been influenced by various empires and colonial powers. The border with Thailand, for example, was established during the British colonial era, while the border with Indonesia was defined after Malaysia gained independence in 1957. The country's proximity to the Strait of Malacca, one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world, has also made it an important player in regional trade and security.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Malaysia's terrain is characterized by a mix of mountains, forests, and coastal plains. The Titiwangsa Mountains, which stretch across the center of Peninsular Malaysia, are the oldest mountain range in the country and are home to a diverse range of flora and fauna. East Malaysia, on the other hand, is dominated by the **Crocker Range**, which includes the highest peak in the country, Gunung Kinabalu. The country's coastal plains are generally narrow and are characterized by mangrove swamps, coral reefs, and sandy beaches.

Malaysia's landscape is also home to a vast network of rivers, including the **Pahang River**, the **Perak River**, and the **Kinabatangan River**. These rivers have played an important role in the country's history, providing a source of fresh water, food, and transportation for the local population. The country's forests, which cover over 60% of its land area, are some of the most biodiverse in the world, with a wide range of plant and animal species, including **orangutans**, **proboscis monkeys**, and **Sumatran rhinos**.

The country's coastline is also notable for its beauty and diversity, with a range of **beaches**, **islands**, and **coral reefs**. The **Perhentian Islands**, located off the coast of northeastern Malaysia, are a popular destination for snorkeling and diving, while the **Langkawi Islands**, located off the coast of northwestern Malaysia, are known for their stunning beaches and mangrove forests.
