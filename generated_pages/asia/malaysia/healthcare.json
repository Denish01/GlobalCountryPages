The public healthcare system is funded by the government and provides comprehensive healthcare services, including preventive, curative, and rehabilitative care. The private sector, on the other hand, offers high-quality healthcare services, often with shorter waiting times and more personalized care. The quality of care in Malaysia is generally excellent, with many public and private hospitals accredited by international organizations such as the Joint Commission International (JCI). However, access to healthcare can be limited in rural areas, where the availability of medical facilities and specialized care may be limited.\n\nThe Malaysian government has implemented various initiatives to improve the healthcare system, including the introduction of the **National Health Financing Scheme**, which aims to provide universal access to healthcare for all citizens.
