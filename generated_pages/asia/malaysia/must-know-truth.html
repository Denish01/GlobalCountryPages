        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Malaysia is a sovereign country located in Southeast Asia, with a rich and diverse history dating back to the ancient times. The country's strategic location at the crossroads of trade routes between India, China, and the Middle East made it an attractive place for various empires and colonial powers to establish their presence. The Malay Peninsula, which forms the western part of Malaysia, was inhabited by indigenous peoples and later became a major hub for the Malay kingdoms, including the ancient kingdom of Srivijaya. The eastern part of Malaysia, known as East Malaysia, was inhabited by various indigenous groups, including the Dayak and the Kadazan.</p>
        <p>The arrival of European colonial powers in the 16th century marked a significant turning point in Malaysian history. The Portuguese established their presence in the Malay Peninsula in 1511, followed by the Dutch in 1641, and later the British in 1786. The British East India Company played a crucial role in the colonization of Malaysia, and in 1867, the British government took control of the Malay states from the company. The British colonial period, which lasted until 1957, had a profound impact on the country's politics, economy, and culture. During this period, the British introduced their language, education system, and administrative structures, which have had a lasting impact on Malaysian society.</p>
        <p>Malaysia gained independence from British colonial rule on August 31, 1957, with Tunku Abdul Rahman as its first prime minister. The country initially consisted of the Malay states, but later expanded to include the states of Sabah and Sarawak in East Malaysia, as well as the island of Singapore, which later became an independent country in 1965. The formation of Malaysia in 1963 was a significant event in the country's history, as it brought together the Malay states, Sabah, and Sarawak under a single federal government.</p>
        <p>Since independence, Malaysia has experienced rapid economic growth and industrialization, driven by its rich natural resources, strategic location, and favorable business environment. The country has also made significant progress in terms of social and economic development, with improvements in education, healthcare, and infrastructure. Today, Malaysia is a <strong>federal constitutional monarchy</strong>, with a diverse population of over 33 million people, comprising Malays, Chinese, Indians, and indigenous groups.</p>
