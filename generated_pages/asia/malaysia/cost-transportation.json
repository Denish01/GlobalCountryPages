The quality of public transit varies between cities, with Kuala Lumpur having a comprehensive and efficient system, while smaller cities and towns may have more limited options. Most people in Malaysia get around using a combination of public transportation and private vehicles, with many owning cars due to the relatively low cost of fuel and parking.\n\nThe country's transportation network is also well-connected, with major cities and towns linked by highways and public transportation routes. However, traffic congestion can be a problem in urban areas, particularly during peak hours, and visitors may find it helpful to plan their journeys in advance to avoid delays. Additionally, many cities in Malaysia have implemented **congestion pricing** schemes to reduce traffic congestion and encourage the use of public transportation.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.50-$1.50 | $20-$30 | Good coverage in major cities, variable quality in smaller towns |\n| Metro / Subway | $0.50-$1.50 | $25-$35 | Available in Kuala Lumpur, with two lines and plans for expansion |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $1-$3 | N/A | Limited routes, mainly used for short distances |\n| Commuter Train | $1-$3 | $30-$40 | Available in Kuala Lumpur and surrounding areas, with frequent services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $1.50 | $0.50 | $5-$10 | Available in most cities, but may not always use meters |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $1 | $0.30 | $3-$6 | Grab is the most popular app, with widespread availability |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$30 | To city center, depending on traffic and time of day |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $0.60 | Prices vary depending on location and taxes |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $0.55 | Slightly cheaper than gasoline, but less widely available |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $30-$50 | Economy car, depending on the rental company and location |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-$3 | Variable rates, with some cities offering free parking |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $2-$5 | Many highways are tolled, with prices depending on the route and distance |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$20 | Frequent services, with variable prices depending on the operator and route |\n| Domestic Flight | $50-$100 | Typical route, such as Kuala Lumpur to Penang, depending on the airline and time of booking |\n| Train (long-distance) | $20-$50 | Available on some routes, such as Kuala Lumpur to Singapore, with prices depending on the class of service |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider using public buses or ride-hailing services instead of taxis.\n- Download the **Grab** app for easy and convenient ride-hailing, and use the **Moovit** app for public transportation planning.\n- Be aware of **traffic congestion** and plan your journeys in advance to avoid delays.\n- When using taxis, always **negotiate the fare** before you start your journey to avoid overcharging.\n- Consider purchasing a **monthly transit pass** for frequent travel on public transportation.\n- Be mindful of your **personal safety** when using public transportation, especially at night, and try to sit near the driver or in a crowded area.",
