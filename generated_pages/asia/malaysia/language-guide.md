[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]
Malaysia is a linguistically diverse country, with over 130 languages spoken across its territories. The official language, Malay, is the most widely spoken and is used as the primary language for official business, education, and government. However, English is also widely spoken, particularly in urban areas and among the business community, and is often used as a second language. Malaysia is also home to several other languages, including Mandarin, Tamil, and various indigenous languages spoken by the country's many ethnic groups. Regional dialects of Malay are also spoken in different parts of the country, with the most prominent being the Kelantanese and Terengganu dialects spoken in the northeastern states.

The linguistic landscape of Malaysia is also influenced by its strategic location at the crossroads of Asia, with many languages and cultures interacting and influencing one another. As a result, many Malaysians are multilingual, speaking two or more languages fluently. English is widely understood in Malaysia, particularly among the younger population and those in the service industry, making it relatively easy for tourists and visitors to communicate and navigate the country. However, speaking some basic Malay phrases can go a long way in showing respect for the local culture and people.

In addition to Malay and English, other languages such as Mandarin and Tamil are also widely spoken, particularly in urban areas with large Chinese and Indian populations. These languages are often used in education, business, and media, and are an integral part of Malaysia's cultural heritage. Overall, the linguistic diversity of Malaysia is a reflection of its rich cultural heritage and its history as a multicultural and multilingual society.
