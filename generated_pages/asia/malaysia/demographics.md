[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Malaysia's population size is relatively small compared to its neighbors, but its growth rate has been steadily increasing over the years. The country's population is projected to reach 42 million by 2030, driven by a combination of natural increase and migration. Urbanization is a significant trend in Malaysia, with more than three-quarters of the population living in urban areas, particularly in the Klang Valley region surrounding Kuala Lumpur. The country's population is also becoming increasingly mobile, with many Malaysians migrating to urban areas in search of better job opportunities and higher living standards.

The population growth rate in Malaysia has been influenced by factors such as improvements in healthcare, education, and economic development. However, the country also faces challenges related to population aging, with a significant increase in the proportion of elderly citizens expected in the coming decades. This demographic shift will have implications for Malaysia's social security system, healthcare services, and labor market.

Malaysia's population is also characterized by a significant proportion of migrant workers, with many foreigners employed in sectors such as construction, manufacturing, and services. The country's migration policies have been designed to balance the need for labor with concerns about national security, social cohesion, and human rights.
