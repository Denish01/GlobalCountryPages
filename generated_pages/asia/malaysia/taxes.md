Malaysia has a **territorial taxation system**, where individuals and companies are taxed on their income earned within the country, regardless of their residency status. However, **worldwide taxation** applies to tax residents, who are required to report their global income in their tax returns. Residency rules for tax purposes in Malaysia are based on the **183-day rule**, where individuals who stay in the country for more than 183 days in a calendar year are considered tax residents.

The Malaysian tax system is administered by the **Inland Revenue Board of Malaysia (IRB)**, which is responsible for collecting taxes, enforcing tax laws, and providing taxpayer services. The IRB also offers various **tax incentives** to encourage foreign investment, promote economic growth, and support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). These incentives include tax exemptions, reduced tax rates, and other benefits for companies that meet specific criteria.
