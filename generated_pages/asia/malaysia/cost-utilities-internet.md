Malaysia has a relatively well-developed utility infrastructure, with most households having access to electricity, water, and gas. The cost of utilities in Malaysia can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher electricity costs during the summer months due to increased air conditioning usage. The Malaysian government has implemented measures to stabilize utility costs, including subsidies for low-income households and price controls on essential goods. However, the overall cost of utilities in Malaysia is still relatively high compared to other countries in the region.

The quality of utility infrastructure in Malaysia is generally good, with most households having access to reliable electricity, water, and sanitation services.
