[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Malaysia has a well-developed transportation network, with a range of options available for getting around, including buses, taxis, ride-hailing services, and trains. The quality of public transit varies between cities, with Kuala Lumpur having a comprehensive and efficient system, while smaller cities and towns may have more limited options. Most people in Malaysia get around using a combination of public transportation and private vehicles, with many owning cars due to the relatively low cost of fuel and parking.

The country's transportation network is also well-connected, with major cities and towns linked by highways and public transportation routes. However, traffic congestion can be a problem in urban areas, particularly during peak hours, and visitors may find it helpful to plan their journeys in advance to avoid delays. Additionally, many cities in Malaysia have implemented **congestion pricing** schemes to reduce traffic congestion and encourage the use of public transportation.
