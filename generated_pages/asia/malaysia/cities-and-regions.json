The states are further divided into districts, which are then subdivided into mukim (sub-districts) and finally, villages. The 3 federal territories are Kuala Lumpur, Putrajaya, and Labuan. This administrative structure allows for a balance of power between the federal government and the individual states, promoting regional autonomy and development. The states are responsible for matters such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure, while the federal government handles issues like defense, foreign policy, and national economy.\n\nThe division of Malaysia into states and federal territories also reflects the country's cultural and geographical diversity. The states are largely based on historical kingdoms and sultanates, with each having its own unique identity and traditions. The federal territories, on the other hand, are more modern creations, established to serve as the country's administrative and economic centers. This blend of traditional and modern elements has contributed to Malaysia's rich cultural heritage and its emergence as a major player in the Asian region.\n\n[SECTION] Major Cities [/SECTION]\n**Kuala Lumpur** (1.8M)\nRole: Capital and economic hub\nKnown For: Kuala Lumpur is a bustling metropolis with a mix of modern skyscrapers, colonial architecture, and vibrant street life.
