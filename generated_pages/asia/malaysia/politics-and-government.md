[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Malaysia is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **executive branch** is headed by the Prime Minister, who is the head of government, while the **legislative branch** is composed of the bicameral Parliament of Malaysia, consisting of the Dewan Rakyat (House of Representatives) and the Dewan Negara (Senate). The **judicial branch** is independent and comprises the Federal Court, the Court of Appeal, and the High Court. Malaysia is a federal state, with power divided between the federal government and the 13 state governments.

The system of government in Malaysia is based on the concept of **separation of powers**, where each branch has distinct roles and responsibilities. The executive branch is responsible for implementing laws and policies, while the legislative branch is responsible for making laws. The judicial branch, on the other hand, is responsible for interpreting laws and ensuring that they are in line with the Constitution. The federal system of government in Malaysia allows for a degree of autonomy for the states, with each state having its own government and legislature.

The **Constitution of Malaysia** is the supreme law of the land, and it outlines the framework of the government and the relationship between the federal government and the states. The Constitution also guarantees certain fundamental rights and freedoms, such as freedom of speech, assembly, and association. The government of Malaysia is committed to upholding the principles of **democracy**, **justice**, and **equality**, and to promoting the well-being and prosperity of all its citizens.
