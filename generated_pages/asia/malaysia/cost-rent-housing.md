[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Malaysia's rental market is relatively stable, with a moderate level of competition among landlords. Typical lease terms range from 6-24 months, with a 2-3 month deposit required. Tenants have rights protected under the Malaysian law, including the right to a written tenancy agreement and protection against unfair eviction. Compared to its regional neighbors, Malaysia's housing costs are relatively moderate, with prices lower than in Singapore but higher than in Indonesia or Thailand. The country's housing market is also influenced by government policies, such as the National Housing Policy, which aims to provide affordable housing for all Malaysians.

The rental market in Malaysia is also affected by the country's economic conditions, with the current inflation rate of 1.8% and GDP per capita of $38,779. The government's efforts to increase the supply of affordable housing and regulate the rental market have helped to keep prices in check. However, the demand for housing, particularly in urban areas, continues to drive up prices. Expats and foreigners can expect to find a wide range of housing options, from modern apartments to traditional houses, with varying prices depending on the location and amenities.
