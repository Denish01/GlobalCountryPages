The coastal region has a mild climate, with average temperatures ranging from 12°C to 28°C (54°F to 82°F) throughout the year. The mountainous region is colder, with heavy snowfall during the winter months, while the Bekaa Valley has a more extreme climate, with cold winters and hot summers. The eastern desert is a **semi-arid region**, with very little rainfall and extreme temperature fluctuations.

The **dry season** in Lebanon typically runs from May to October, with very little rainfall and high temperatures. This is the peak tourist season, with many visitors flocking to the country's beaches and historical sites.
