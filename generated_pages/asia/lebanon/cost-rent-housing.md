[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Lebanon's housing market is known for being competitive, especially in the city center of Beirut. The rental market is largely driven by expats and foreigners, which has led to an increase in prices over the years. Typical lease terms in Lebanon range from 6-12 months, with a deposit requirement of 1-2 months' rent. Tenant rights are limited in Lebanon, and it is not uncommon for landlords to raise rents or terminate contracts with little notice. Compared to regional neighbors, Lebanon's housing costs are relatively high, with cities like Damascus and Tel Aviv offering more affordable options.

The high inflation rate in Lebanon, currently at 45.2%, has also had a significant impact on the housing market. As the cost of living continues to rise, many Lebanese are finding it difficult to afford housing, leading to an increase in demand for more affordable options. The government has implemented some measures to try to control prices, but the market remains largely unregulated. For expats and foreigners, it is essential to research and understand the local market before signing a lease or purchasing a property.
