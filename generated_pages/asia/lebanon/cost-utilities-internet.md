[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Lebanon's utility infrastructure is generally well-developed, with most households having access to electricity, water, and gas. However, the cost of utilities can be unstable and fluctuating due to the country's economic situation and **inflation rate** of 45.2% as of 2024. The cost of utilities also varies by season, with higher electricity costs during the summer months due to increased demand for air conditioning. Additionally, the **inflation rate** can impact the purchasing power of the local currency, LBP, which may affect the cost of utilities and other essential services.

The quality of utility infrastructure in Lebanon is generally good, with most households having access to a reliable supply of electricity, water, and gas. However, the cost of utilities can be a significant burden for many households, especially those with lower incomes. The **GDP per capita PPP** of $12,575 in 2023 indicates a relatively high standard of living, but the **out-of-pocket health spend** of 29.7% in 2023 and **education spend** of 1.2% of GDP in 2024 suggest that many households may have limited disposable income to spend on utilities and other essential services.
