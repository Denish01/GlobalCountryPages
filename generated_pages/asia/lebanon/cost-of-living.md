[SECTION] How Expensive Is Lebanon? [/SECTION]
Lebanon is a moderate to expensive country to live in or visit, with prices comparable to those in Western Europe. The cost of living in Lebanon is higher than in neighboring countries such as Syria, but lower than in some of the more affluent Gulf states. The country's economy has been affected by regional instability and a large refugee population, which has put pressure on housing, food, and other living costs. However, Lebanon remains a popular destination for tourists and expats, drawn by its rich culture, history, and natural beauty.

Overall, Lebanon is a relatively expensive country, but prices can vary depending on the location, with Beirut being the most expensive city. The cost of living in other cities such as Tripoli, Sidon, and Tyre is lower, but still higher than in many other countries in the region. Visitors can expect to pay around $30-50 USD per day for basic expenses, while mid-range travelers can budget around $60-100 USD per day.
