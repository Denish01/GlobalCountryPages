  "content": "The infrastructure in Lebanon is characterized by a mix of modern and outdated systems, with significant investments in recent years aimed at improving the country's roads, energy, and telecommunications sectors. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 99% of population\nInternet Penetration: 74%\nRoad Network: 7,000 km, moderate quality with frequent traffic congestion\nRail Network: 0 km, no rail network\nMajor Airports: 1\nMajor Ports: 2\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nLebanon's infrastructure development level is relatively high compared to other countries in the region, with a strong focus on urban areas. However, the country still faces significant challenges, including frequent power outages, traffic congestion, and limited access to basic services in rural areas. Recent investments have aimed at addressing these issues, with a focus on upgrading the country's road network, expanding its energy generation capacity, and improving its telecommunications infrastructure. The urban-rural gap remains a significant challenge, with many rural areas lacking access to basic services such as reliable electricity, clean water, and high-speed internet.\n\nThe government has launched several initiatives to address these challenges, including the development of a new national infrastructure plan, which aims to upgrade the country's roads, energy, and telecommunications sectors. The plan also includes investments in renewable energy, water management, and waste management, with the goal of reducing the country's environmental footprint and improving the overall quality of life for its citizens. Despite these efforts, the country still faces significant infrastructure challenges, including a significant shortage of electricity and a lack of investment in its transportation sector.\n\nLebanon's infrastructure sector has also been impacted by the country's political and economic challenges, including a significant decline in the value of its currency and a shortage of foreign investment. These challenges have made it difficult for the government to secure funding for its infrastructure projects, and have led to delays and cancellations of several major projects. Despite these challenges, the government remains committed to upgrading the country's infrastructure, and is working to secure funding from international donors and private investors.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 7,000 km | Moderate | Frequent traffic congestion, especially in urban areas |\n| Railways | 0 km | N/A | No rail network, plans to develop a new rail line |\n| Airports | 1 international, 0 domestic | Good | Beirut-Rafic Hariri International Airport is the country's main airport |\n| Ports | 2 major | Good | The ports of Beirut and Tripoli are the country's main ports |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- The country's power generation capacity is largely based on **thermal power plants**, with a total capacity of around 2,000 MW.\n- The **reliability of the power supply** is a significant challenge, with frequent outages and load shedding, especially during peak summer months.\n- **Renewable energy** sources, such as solar and wind power, are becoming increasingly important, with several new projects launched in recent years.\n- The government has launched several initiatives to **improve energy efficiency**, including the development of a new energy efficiency plan and the launch of a series of energy-saving initiatives.\n- **Power outages** are a frequent occurrence, especially in rural areas, where the grid is often unreliable and subject to frequent disruptions.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water safety** is a significant concern, with many areas lacking access to safe and clean drinking water.\n- **Sanitation coverage** is relatively high, with around 90% of the population having access to improved sanitation facilities.\n- **Water access** in rural areas is a significant challenge, with many communities lacking access to reliable and clean water sources.\n- The government has launched several initiatives to **improve water management**, including the development of a new water management plan and the launch of a series of water conservation initiatives.\n- **Wastewater treatment** is a significant challenge, with many areas lacking access to adequate wastewater treatment facilities.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is relatively high, with around 95% of the population having access to mobile phone services.\n- **Fiber/broadband** services are becoming increasingly available, with several new projects launched in recent years to expand the country's fiber-optic network.\n- The **4G/5G rollout** is ongoing, with several mobile operators launching new services in recent years.\n- **Postal services** are relatively underdeveloped, with many areas lacking access to reliable and efficient postal services.\n- **Internet penetration** is relatively high, with around 74% of the population having access to the internet.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The government has launched several major infrastructure projects, including the development of a new **railway line** and the expansion of the country's **road network**.\n- The **Beirut-Rafic Hariri International Airport** is undergoing a major expansion, with several new terminals and facilities being developed.\n- The government has also launched several initiatives to **improve the country's energy sector**, including the development of new **renewable energy** projects and the expansion of the country's **power grid**.\n- **Water management** is a significant priority, with several new projects launched to improve the country's water supply and sanitation systems.\n- The government is also working to **improve the country's telecommunications sector**, with several new projects launched to expand the country's **fiber-optic network** and improve its **mobile coverage**.",
