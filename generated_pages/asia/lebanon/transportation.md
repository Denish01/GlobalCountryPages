[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Lebanon's main international airport is the Beirut-Rafic Hariri International Airport, located about 9 kilometers south of the city center. The airport receives direct flights from major hubs in the Middle East, Europe, and Africa, including Dubai, Istanbul, Paris, and Cairo. If you're traveling from North America, you may need to connect through a European or Middle Eastern hub. Overland entry points are available from Syria and Israel, although the border with Syria is currently closed due to the ongoing conflict. The border with Israel is also closed to most travelers, except for citizens of countries that have a visa agreement with Israel.

Travelers can also enter Lebanon by sea, with the Port of Beirut being the main entry point. However, this option is less common and usually more expensive than flying. The port receives cargo ships and ferries from neighboring countries, but there are no regular passenger ferry services. If you're planning to enter Lebanon by sea, it's best to check with the shipping company or your travel agent for the latest information and schedules.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Lebanon has a limited domestic air network, with only a few flights per week connecting Beirut to other cities in the country. The main domestic airline is Middle East Airlines, which operates flights from Beirut to destinations such as Tripoli and Tyre. However, these flights are not very frequent and are often more expensive than taking a taxi or bus. It's recommended to book in advance to secure the best prices, and to check the airline's website for the latest schedules and fares. Approximate costs for a one-way domestic flight can range from $50 to $100, depending on the route and time of booking.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Lebanon has no rail network, making it one of the few countries in the world without a railway system. This is due to a combination of historical, geographical, and economic factors, including the country's mountainous terrain and the lack of investment in rail infrastructure. As a result, travelers must rely on other modes of transportation, such as buses, taxis, and car rentals, to get around the country.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Lebanon has a well-developed network of intercity buses and coaches, which connect major cities and towns across the country. The main bus companies are OCFTC (Office des Chemins de Fer et des Transports en Commun) and LCC (Lebanese Commuting Company), which operate modern and comfortable buses on most routes. Fares are relatively cheap, ranging from $5 to $10 for a one-way ticket, depending on the route and distance. However, buses can be crowded and may not always run on schedule, so it's a good idea to check with the bus company or a local travel agent for the latest information and timetables.
