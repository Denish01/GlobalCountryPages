        <h2>Economic Overview</h2>
        <p>Lebanon has a high-income economy, driven primarily by its service sector. The country's strategic location at the crossroads of Europe, Africa, and Asia has made it an important hub for trade and commerce. Lebanon's economy is considered upper-middle income, with a GDP per capita of around $9,600. However, the country faces significant challenges, including a large public debt, high unemployment, and a lack of natural resources. Despite these challenges, Lebanon's economy has shown resilience and adaptability, with a strong banking sector and a growing tourism industry.</p>
        <p>Lebanon's economic development has been shaped by its complex history and geography. The country has a long tradition of trade and commerce, dating back to the ancient Phoenicians. In recent years, Lebanon has made significant progress in developing its infrastructure, including its transportation networks, energy sector, and telecommunications. However, the country still faces significant challenges, including a large public debt and a high unemployment rate. To address these challenges, the Lebanese government has implemented a range of economic reforms, including measures to promote private sector growth, improve the business environment, and increase foreign investment.</p>
        <p>Despite these efforts, Lebanon's economy remains vulnerable to external shocks, including regional instability and global economic trends. The country's economy is also heavily reliant on remittances from Lebanese citizens living abroad, which can be a volatile source of income. To reduce its dependence on remittances and promote more sustainable economic growth, the Lebanese government has emphasized the need to diversify the country's economy and promote exports. This includes efforts to develop the country's manufacturing sector, increase agricultural production, and promote tourism.</p>
