  "title": "Getting Around Lebanon — Transport & Travel Guide",
  "content": "To get around in Lebanon, you can use a combination of taxis, buses, and car rentals, as well as ride-hailing apps, although the country's transportation network is relatively underdeveloped compared to other countries in the region.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMain International Airport(s): Beirut-Rafic Hariri International Airport (BEY)\nDomestic Air Network: limited\nRail Network: none\nDrives On: right\nRoad Quality: moderate\nRide-Hailing Apps: Uber, Careem\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]\nLebanon's main international airport is the Beirut-Rafic Hariri International Airport, located about 9 kilometers south of the city center. The airport receives direct flights from major hubs in the Middle East, Europe, and Africa, including Dubai, Istanbul, Paris, and Cairo. If you're traveling from North America, you may need to connect through a European or Middle Eastern hub. Overland entry points are available from Syria and Israel, although the border with Syria is currently closed due to the ongoing conflict. The border with Israel is also closed to most travelers, except for citizens of countries that have a visa agreement with Israel.\n\nTravelers can also enter Lebanon by sea, with the Port of Beirut being the main entry point. However, this option is less common and usually more expensive than flying. The port receives cargo ships and ferries from neighboring countries, but there are no regular passenger ferry services. If you're planning to enter Lebanon by sea, it's best to check with the shipping company or your travel agent for the latest information and schedules.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nLebanon has a limited domestic air network, with only a few flights per week connecting Beirut to other cities in the country. The main domestic airline is Middle East Airlines, which operates flights from Beirut to destinations such as Tripoli and Tyre. However, these flights are not very frequent and are often more expensive than taking a taxi or bus. It's recommended to book in advance to secure the best prices, and to check the airline's website for the latest schedules and fares. Approximate costs for a one-way domestic flight can range from $50 to $100, depending on the route and time of booking.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nLebanon has no rail network, making it one of the few countries in the world without a railway system. This is due to a combination of historical, geographical, and economic factors, including the country's mountainous terrain and the lack of investment in rail infrastructure. As a result, travelers must rely on other modes of transportation, such as buses, taxis, and car rentals, to get around the country.\n\n[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]\nLebanon has a well-developed network of intercity buses and coaches, which connect major cities and towns across the country. The main bus companies are OCFTC (Office des Chemins de Fer et des Transports en Commun) and LCC (Lebanese Commuting Company), which operate modern and comfortable buses on most routes. Fares are relatively cheap, ranging from $5 to $10 for a one-way ticket, depending on the route and distance. However, buses can be crowded and may not always run on schedule, so it's a good idea to check with the bus company or a local travel agent for the latest information and timetables.\n\n[SECTION] City Transport [/SECTION]\n| Mode | Available In | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metro/Subway | none | - | Lebanon has no metro or subway system |\n| City Bus | Beirut, Tripoli, Sidon | $0.50-$1 | frequent services, but can be crowded |\n| Taxi | everywhere | $5-$10/km | metered taxis are widely available |\n| Ride-Hailing | Beirut, major cities | $5-$10 | Uber and Careem operate in Lebanon |\n| Tuk-tuk/Rickshaw | none | - | not available in Lebanon |\n\n[SECTION] Driving [/SECTION]\n- To drive in Lebanon, you'll need a valid international driving permit (IDP) or a local driving license.\n- Road conditions in Lebanon can be poor, especially outside of major cities, with many roads being narrow and winding.\n- Fuel costs are relatively high in Lebanon, with gasoline prices averaging around $1.50 per liter.\n- Car rental companies are available at the airport and in major cities, with prices starting from around $40 per day for a economy car.\n- When driving in Lebanon, be aware of the local traffic culture, which can be aggressive and chaotic, especially in Beirut.\n- It's also a good idea to check the weather forecast before embarking on a road trip, as heavy rain or snow can make some roads impassable.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be cautious when using taxis, as some drivers may try to overcharge or take you on a longer route than necessary.\n- Always agree on the fare before you start your journey, or make sure the meter is working.\n- When using ride-hailing apps, be aware of the estimated fare and any additional charges that may apply.\n- It's a good idea to download a local mapping app, such as Waze or Google Maps, to help navigate Lebanon's roads and traffic.\n- Be prepared for traffic congestion, especially during rush hour or in areas with roadworks.\n- When driving, be aware of the local speed limits, which are generally lower than in other countries.\n- It's also a good idea to learn some basic Arabic phrases, such as \"where is...\" or \"how much...\", to help you communicate with locals and get around more easily.\n- Finally, be mindful of your surroundings and keep an eye on your belongings, especially in crowded areas or tourist hotspots.",
