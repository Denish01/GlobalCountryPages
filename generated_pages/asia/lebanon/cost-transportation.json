The quality of public transit is generally good, with frequent bus services and affordable fares. However, the traffic in major cities like Beirut can be chaotic, and road conditions in some areas may be poor. Most people in Lebanon get around using private cars or taxis, but public transportation is also a popular option, especially among locals and students.\n\nThe transportation network in Lebanon is quite extensive, with many buses and taxis operating in major cities and towns. However, the lack of a comprehensive metro or subway system means that commuters often rely on buses and shared taxis to get around. The government has been investing in improving the transportation infrastructure, including the construction of new roads and highways, but more needs to be done to address the country's chronic traffic congestion problems.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.50-$1.00 | $20-$30 | Good coverage, frequent services |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $1.00-$2.00 | N/A | Limited routes, affordable fares |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $3.00 | $1.00 | $5-$10 | Be sure to negotiate the fare before starting the journey |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $2.00 | $0.50 | $5-$10 | Uber, Careem available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$30 | To city center, depending on traffic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.00 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$60 | Economy car, depending on the rental company |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $2-$5 | Limited parking spaces available |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $5-$10 | Depending on the route and distance |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$20 | Depending on the route and bus company |\n| Domestic Flight | $50-$100 | Limited domestic flights available |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider using public buses or shared taxis, which are affordable and widely available.\n- Use ride-hailing apps like Uber or Careem to get around, especially at night or in areas with limited public transportation.\n- Always negotiate the fare with taxi drivers before starting the journey to avoid overcharging.\n- Be aware of your surroundings and keep an eye on your belongings, especially in crowded areas or public transportation.\n- Consider renting a car for intercity travel, as it can be more convenient and cost-effective than public transportation.\n- Download transportation apps like **Waze** or **Google Maps** to help navigate the roads and avoid traffic congestion.",
