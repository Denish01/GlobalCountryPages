[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Lebanon has a mixed healthcare system, which combines both public and private providers. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and overcrowded, with long waiting times and limited resources. In contrast, private healthcare providers offer higher quality care, but at a significantly higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only affordable option, while foreigners and those who can afford it often opt for private healthcare. It is recommended to have health insurance in Lebanon, as out-of-pocket expenses can be high, especially for private healthcare services.

The healthcare system in Lebanon is also affected by the country's economic situation, with a high inflation rate and a large portion of the population relying on out-of-pocket expenses for healthcare. This has led to a significant burden on the public healthcare system, which struggles to provide adequate care to those in need. As a result, many people in Lebanon rely on private healthcare providers, which can be expensive, but offer better quality care.

[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]
In the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the emergency number 140 or go to the nearest hospital. Public hospitals often have emergency rooms, but may be overcrowded and underfunded. Private hospitals, on the other hand, often have more advanced emergency services and equipment. For foreigners, it is recommended to go to a private hospital, as they often have more experience in treating international patients. Some of the best hospitals for foreigners in Lebanon include the American University of Beirut Medical Center and the Saint George Hospital University Medical Center.

It is also important to note that ambulance services are available in Lebanon, but may not always be reliable. In the event of an emergency, it may be better to take a taxi or drive to the hospital, rather than waiting for an ambulance. Additionally, it is recommended to have a basic knowledge of Arabic, as not all medical staff may speak English. Overall, while the healthcare system in Lebanon has its challenges, there are many high-quality medical providers and services available, especially in the private sector.
