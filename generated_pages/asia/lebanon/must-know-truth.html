        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Lebanon has a rich and complex history, with various civilizations and empires vying for control over the region. The <strong>Phoenicians</strong>, a Semitic people, established a thriving civilization in the area from 1500 to 300 BCE. The Phoenicians were known for their advanced maritime trade networks and their significant contributions to the development of the <strong>alphabet</strong>. Following the Phoenicians, Lebanon was conquered by the <strong>Assyrians</strong>, <strong>Persians</strong>, and <strong>Romans</strong>, each leaving their mark on the region's culture and architecture. In 635 CE, Lebanon was conquered by the <strong>Arabs</strong>, who introduced <strong>Islam</strong> to the region.</p>
        <p>The <strong>Ottoman Empire</strong> ruled Lebanon from 1516 to 1918, during which time the region experienced significant economic and cultural growth. Following World War I, Lebanon was placed under <strong>French mandate</strong> by the League of Nations, which lasted until 1943. On November 22, 1943, Lebanon gained its <strong>independence</strong> from France, with the establishment of the Lebanese Republic. Since then, Lebanon has experienced periods of stability and instability, including a <strong>civil war</strong> from 1975 to 1990.</p>
        <p>Lebanon's strategic location at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa has made it an important center for trade and cultural exchange throughout history. The country's diverse landscape, which includes mountains, valleys, and a coastline along the <strong>Mediterranean Sea</strong>, has also played a significant role in shaping its history and culture. Today, Lebanon is a <strong>sovereign state</strong> with a <strong>parliamentary democracy</strong> system of government.</p>
        <p>The country's history has been marked by significant events, including the <strong>Israeli occupation</strong> of southern Lebanon from 1982 to 2000, and the <strong>Syrian occupation</strong> from 1976 to 2005. In 2005, former Prime Minister <strong>Rafik Hariri</strong> was assassinated, leading to widespread protests and the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon. Since then, Lebanon has continued to face challenges, including a <strong>refugee crisis</strong> and ongoing <strong>political instability</strong>.</p>
