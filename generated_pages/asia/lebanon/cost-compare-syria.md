[SECTION] Overview: Lebanon vs Syria [/SECTION]
Lebanon and Syria are two neighboring countries in the Middle East with distinct economic profiles. Lebanon has a relatively stable economy, with a strong service sector and a high standard of living, which contributes to its higher cost of living. In contrast, Syria has been experiencing economic instability due to the ongoing civil war, which has led to a significant decline in its economy and a subsequent decrease in the cost of living. Overall, Syria is generally cheaper than Lebanon, with a difference of around 30-50% in various categories.

The economic context of both countries plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Lebanon's economy is driven by services, including finance, tourism, and trade, which attracts a high-income population and drives up prices. On the other hand, Syria's economy has been severely affected by the war, leading to a shortage of goods and services, which can make it challenging for expats and foreigners to find affordable options. However, for locals and those who are accustomed to the local way of life, Syria can be a more affordable option.
