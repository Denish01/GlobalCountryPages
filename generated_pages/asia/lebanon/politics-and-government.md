[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The Lebanese government is based on a system of **confessionalism**, where power is divided among the country's main religious groups, including **Christians**, **Sunnis**, **Shiites**, and **Druze**. This system aims to ensure representation and balance among the different groups. The **separation of powers** is established between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches, with the president serving as the head of state, the prime minister as the head of government, and the parliament as the legislative body. Lebanon has a **unitary system**, with a centralized government and no federal states.

The government's structure is designed to promote **national unity** and **stability**, with a focus on maintaining the delicate balance of power among the different religious groups. The **Taif Agreement**, signed in 1989, established the framework for the current political system, with a emphasis on **power-sharing** and **representation**. However, this system has also been criticized for being **inefficient** and **corrupt**, with many politicians prioritizing their own interests over the needs of the country.

The Lebanese political system is also influenced by the country's complex history and its relationships with neighboring countries, particularly **Syria** and **Israel**. The government has struggled to maintain its **sovereignty** and **independence**, with many politicians having close ties to foreign powers. Despite these challenges, the Lebanese people have consistently demonstrated their commitment to **democracy** and **freedom**, with a vibrant civil society and a strong tradition of **protest** and **activism**.
