The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and overcrowded, with long waiting times and limited resources. In contrast, private healthcare providers offer higher quality care, but at a significantly higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only affordable option, while foreigners and those who can afford it often opt for private healthcare. It is recommended to have health insurance in Lebanon, as out-of-pocket expenses can be high, especially for private healthcare services.\n\nThe healthcare system in Lebanon is also affected by the country's economic situation, with a high inflation rate and a large portion of the population relying on out-of-pocket expenses for healthcare. This has led to a significant burden on the public healthcare system, which struggles to provide adequate care to those in need. As a result, many people in Lebanon rely on private healthcare providers, which can be expensive, but offer better quality care.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $10-$20 | $50-$100 | Public hospitals often have long waiting times |\n| Specialist Consultation | $20-$50 | $100-$250 | Private clinics often have more experienced specialists |\n| Dental Checkup | $20-$50 | $50-$150 | Private dental clinics offer more advanced services |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$30 | $30-$100 | Private optometrists often have more modern equipment |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $20-$50 | Private labs often have faster turnaround times |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$200 | Public hospitals often have limited resources |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $100-$500 | Private hospitals offer more comfortable accommodations |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$2,000 | Private clinics often have more experienced surgeons |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,000-$3,000 | Private hospitals offer more advanced maternity services |\n| MRI Scan | $100-$300 | Private imaging centers often have more modern equipment |\n| X-Ray | $10-$50 | Public hospitals often have older equipment |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Public hospital care, basic medical services |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-$300 | Private hospital care, specialist consultations, advanced medical services |\n| International / Expat | $200-$500 | Global coverage, including emergency medical evacuation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medications are widely available in Lebanon, but can be expensive, with prices ranging from $10 to $50 per month.\n- Over-the-counter medications are also widely available, with prices starting from $5.\n- Pharmacies are abundant in urban areas, but may be limited in rural areas.\n- Some medications may require a prescription from a licensed doctor.\n- Prices for medications can vary significantly depending on the pharmacy and location.\n- It is recommended to check the prices and availability of medications before purchasing.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the emergency number 140 or go to the nearest hospital. Public hospitals often have emergency rooms, but may be overcrowded and underfunded. Private hospitals, on the other hand, often have more advanced emergency services and equipment. For foreigners, it is recommended to go to a private hospital, as they often have more experience in treating international patients. Some of the best hospitals for foreigners in Lebanon include the American University of Beirut Medical Center and the Saint George Hospital University Medical Center.\n\nIt is also important to note that ambulance services are available in Lebanon, but may not always be reliable. In the event of an emergency, it may be better to take a taxi or drive to the hospital, rather than waiting for an ambulance. Additionally, it is recommended to have a basic knowledge of Arabic, as not all medical staff may speak English. Overall, while the healthcare system in Lebanon has its challenges, there are many high-quality medical providers and services available, especially in the private sector.",
