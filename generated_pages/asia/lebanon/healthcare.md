[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Lebanon's healthcare system is a mix of public and private providers, with the public sector providing primary care and some specialized services, while the private sector offers more advanced and specialized care. The quality of care in Lebanon is generally good, with many well-trained healthcare professionals and modern medical facilities, particularly in urban areas such as Beirut. However, there are significant disparities in access to healthcare services between urban and rural areas, with rural areas often having limited access to specialized care and modern medical facilities. The Ministry of Public Health is responsible for overseeing the healthcare system and ensuring that all citizens have access to essential healthcare services.

The public healthcare system in Lebanon provides basic medical care to all citizens, including primary care, hospitalization, and some specialized services. However, the public system is often underfunded and understaffed, which can result in long waiting times and limited access to specialized care. In contrast, the private healthcare system in Lebanon is well-developed and offers high-quality medical services, including specialized care and advanced medical procedures. However, private healthcare services are often expensive and may not be accessible to all citizens, particularly those in rural areas or with limited financial resources.

Despite the challenges facing the healthcare system in Lebanon, the country has made significant progress in improving healthcare outcomes in recent years, including reducing infant mortality rates and increasing life expectancy. However, there are still significant health challenges facing the country, including a high prevalence of non-communicable diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer, as well as a growing burden of mental health disorders.
