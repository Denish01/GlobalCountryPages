The governorates are further divided into districts, which are then divided into municipalities. This system allows for a degree of autonomy at the local level, while still maintaining a strong central government. The 8 governorates are Beirut, Mount Lebanon, North Lebanon, Akkar, Baalbek-Hermel, Beqaa, Nabatieh, and South Lebanon, each with its own unique character and charm.\n\nThe administrative structure of Lebanon is designed to balance the needs of the country's diverse population, which includes Christians, Muslims, and Druze. The system has been in place since the country gained independence in 1943, and has undergone several reforms over the years to improve efficiency and representation. Despite its complexities, the system has helped to maintain stability and promote economic growth in the country.\n\n[SECTION] Major Cities [/SECTION]\n**Beirut** (361,366)\nRole: capital, economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: its vibrant nightlife, historic landmarks, and cosmopolitan atmosphere\nBest For: business travelers, history buffs, and partygoers\n\n**Tripoli** (227,857)\nRole: economic hub, port city\nKnown For: its historic old city, bustling markets, and stunning coastal views\nBest For: shoppers, foodies, and those interested in history and culture\n\n**Sidon** (80,000)\nRole: cultural center, historic city\nKnown For: its ancient ruins, historic mosques, and traditional souks\nBest For: history buffs, cultural enthusiasts, and families\n\n**Tyre** (60,000)\nRole: port city, historic site\nKnown For: its ancient ruins, stunning coastal views, and vibrant markets\nBest For: history buffs, beachgoers, and those interested in culture and relaxation\n\n**Byblos** (40,000)\nRole: historic city, tourist hub\nKnown For: its ancient ruins, historic old town, and vibrant nightlife\nBest For: history buffs, partygoers, and those interested in culture and relaxation\n\n**Zahle** (50,000)\nRole: economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: its historic old town, vibrant markets, and stunning mountain views\nBest For: shoppers, foodies, and those interested in history and culture\n\n**Baalbek** (30,000)\nRole: historic site, cultural center\nKnown For: its ancient ruins, stunning architecture, and vibrant festivals\nBest For: history buffs, cultural enthusiasts, and those interested in architecture and design\n\n[SECTION] Key Regions [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Region | Character | Known For | Major City |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Mount Lebanon | Mountainous, scenic | Skiing, hiking, historic towns | Bhamdoun |\n| Beqaa Valley | Fertile, agricultural | Wine production, historic sites | Zahle |\n| North Lebanon | Coastal, urban | Historic cities, beaches | Tripoli |\n| South Lebanon | Coastal, rural | Historic sites, natural beauty | Tyre |\n| Beirut | Urban, cosmopolitan | Nightlife, historic landmarks, business | Beirut |\n| Akkar | Rural, mountainous | Scenic views, historic sites | Halba |\n| Nabatieh | Rural, agricultural | Historic sites, natural beauty | Nabatieh |\n| Baalbek-Hermel | Mountainous, historic | Ancient ruins, stunning architecture | Baalbek |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Differences [/SECTION]\n- The regions of Lebanon differ significantly in terms of culture, with the north being more conservative and the south being more liberal.\n- The economy of each region also varies, with the Beqaa Valley being known for its agriculture and wine production, and the north being a hub for industry and trade.\n- The climate of each region is distinct, with the mountains being cooler and more snowy, and the coastal areas being warmer and more humid.\n- The language spoken in each region is also different, with Arabic being the official language, but with many people speaking French, English, or other languages in different parts of the country.\n\n[SECTION] Getting Around [/SECTION]\nLebanon has a relatively well-developed transportation system, with domestic flights available between major cities. However, the road network is often congested, and driving conditions can be challenging, especially in the mountains. Buses are a popular mode of transportation, with many companies operating routes between cities and towns. Taxis are also widely available, but can be more expensive than buses. The country has no rail network, but there are plans to build a new railway system in the future. Overall, getting around Lebanon can be an adventure, but with some planning and patience, visitors can easily explore the country's many wonders. \n\nThe best way to get around Lebanon is by car, as it allows for flexibility and convenience. However, driving in Lebanon can be challenging, especially for those who are not used to the local driving style. Visitors can also hire taxis or use public transportation, which is relatively affordable and efficient. For those who prefer to fly, domestic flights are available between major cities, but may not be as frequent as bus or taxi services. [CALLOUT] It is recommended to plan ahead and research transportation options before traveling to Lebanon, as the roads and traffic can be unpredictable.",
