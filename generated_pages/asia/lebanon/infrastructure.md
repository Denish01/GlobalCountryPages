# Lebanon Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

The infrastructure in Lebanon is characterized by a mix of modern and outdated systems, with significant investments in recent years aimed at improving the country's roads, energy, and telecommunications sectors. 

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 99% of population
Internet Penetration: 74%
Road Network: 7,000 km, moderate quality with frequent traffic congestion
Rail Network: 0 km, no rail network
Major Airports: 1
Major Ports: 2
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Lebanon's infrastructure development level is relatively high compared to other countries in the region, with a strong focus on urban areas. However, the country still faces significant challenges, including frequent power outages, traffic congestion, and limited access to basic services in rural areas. Recent investments have aimed at addressing these issues, with a focus on upgrading the country's road network, expanding its energy generation capacity, and improving its telecommunications infrastructure. The urban-rural gap remains a significant challenge, with many rural areas lacking access to basic services such as reliable electricity, clean water, and high-speed internet.

The government has launched several initiatives to address these challenges, including the development of a new national infrastructure plan, which aims to upgrade the country's roads, energy, and telecommunications sectors. The plan also includes investments in renewable energy, water management, and waste management, with the goal of reducing the country's environmental footprint and improving the overall quality of life for its citizens. Despite these efforts, the country still faces significant infrastructure challenges, including a significant shortage of electricity and a lack of investment in its transportation sector.

Lebanon's infrastructure sector has also been impacted by the country's political and economic challenges, including a significant decline in the value of its currency and a shortage of foreign investment. These challenges have made it difficult for the government to secure funding for its infrastructure projects, and have led to delays and cancellations of several major projects. Despite these challenges, the government remains committed to upgrading the country's infrastructure, and is working to secure funding from international donors and private investors.
