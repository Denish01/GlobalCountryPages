The business environment in Lebanon is characterized by a complex and often slow-moving bureaucracy, which can make it difficult for foreign investors to navigate. The government has implemented various reforms to improve the business climate, including the establishment of a one-stop shop for company registration and the introduction of a new investment law.

The government's attitude towards foreign investment is generally positive, and there are various incentives in place to attract foreign investors.
