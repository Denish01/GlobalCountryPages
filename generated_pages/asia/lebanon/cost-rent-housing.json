The rental market is largely driven by expats and foreigners, which has led to an increase in prices over the years. Typical lease terms in Lebanon range from 6-12 months, with a deposit requirement of 1-2 months' rent. Tenant rights are limited in Lebanon, and it is not uncommon for landlords to raise rents or terminate contracts with little notice. Compared to regional neighbors, Lebanon's housing costs are relatively high, with cities like Damascus and Tel Aviv offering more affordable options.\n\nThe high inflation rate in Lebanon, currently at 45.2%, has also had a significant impact on the housing market. As the cost of living continues to rise, many Lebanese are finding it difficult to afford housing, leading to an increase in demand for more affordable options. The government has implemented some measures to try to control prices, but the market remains largely unregulated. For expats and foreigners, it is essential to research and understand the local market before signing a lease or purchasing a property.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $300-$500 | $200-$350 | Compact, basic amenities |\n| 1 Bedroom | $400-$700 | $250-$450 | Standard, 1 bathroom, kitchen |\n| 2 Bedroom | $600-$1,000 | $350-$600 | Family size, 2 bathrooms, kitchen |\n| 3 Bedroom | $900-$1,500 | $500-$900 | Spacious, 3 bathrooms, kitchen, balcony |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $2,500-$4,000 | Prime locations, high-rise buildings |\n| Suburbs | $1,500-$2,500 | Residential areas, family-friendly |\n| Rural | $500-$1,000 | Scenic views, agricultural land |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Achrafieh**: $500-$1,000 USD per month for a one-bedroom apartment, known for its vibrant nightlife and shopping centers\n- **Hamra**: $400-$900 USD per month for a one-bedroom apartment, a popular area for expats and students\n- **Kantari**: $350-$700 USD per month for a one-bedroom apartment, a quiet and residential area\n- **Mar Mikhael**: $450-$1,000 USD per month for a one-bedroom apartment, a trendy neighborhood with bars and restaurants\n- **Raouche**: $500-$1,200 USD per month for a one-bedroom apartment, a seaside area with stunning views\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Lebanon [/SECTION]\n- Research the local market and understand the prices before signing a lease\n- Always inspect the property before signing a contract\n- Negotiate the rent and deposit with the landlord\n- Be aware of scams and fake listings, especially when dealing with online advertisements\n- Utilities such as electricity and water are usually not included in the rent\n- Furnished apartments are more common in Lebanon, but unfurnished options are also available\n- Consider working with a real estate agent to find a property, but be prepared for additional fees",
