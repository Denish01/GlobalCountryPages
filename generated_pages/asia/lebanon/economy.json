The country's strategic location at the crossroads of Europe, Africa, and Asia has made it an important hub for trade and commerce. Lebanon's economy is considered upper-middle income, with a GDP per capita of around $9,600. However, the country faces significant challenges, including a large public debt, high unemployment, and a lack of natural resources. Despite these challenges, Lebanon's economy has shown resilience and adaptability, with a strong banking sector and a growing tourism industry.\n\nLebanon's economic development has been shaped by its complex history and geography. The country has a long tradition of trade and commerce, dating back to the ancient Phoenicians. In recent years, Lebanon has made significant progress in developing its infrastructure, including its transportation networks, energy sector, and telecommunications.
