[SECTION] How Lebanon Is Divided [/SECTION]
Lebanon is divided into 8 governorates, each with its own capital and administrative structure. The governorates are further divided into districts, which are then divided into municipalities. This system allows for a degree of autonomy at the local level, while still maintaining a strong central government. The 8 governorates are Beirut, Mount Lebanon, North Lebanon, Akkar, Baalbek-Hermel, Beqaa, Nabatieh, and South Lebanon, each with its own unique character and charm.

The administrative structure of Lebanon is designed to balance the needs of the country's diverse population, which includes Christians, Muslims, and Druze. The system has been in place since the country gained independence in 1943, and has undergone several reforms over the years to improve efficiency and representation. Despite its complexities, the system has helped to maintain stability and promote economic growth in the country.
