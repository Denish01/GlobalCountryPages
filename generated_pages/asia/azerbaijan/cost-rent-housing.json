The typical lease term in Azerbaijan is one year, with a deposit requirement of one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected by law, but it is still essential for renters to carefully review their lease agreements before signing. Compared to its regional neighbors, Azerbaijan's housing costs are relatively **high**, especially in the capital city of Baku. However, the country's **low inflation rate** of 2.2% and **high GDP per capita** of $25,089 make it an attractive destination for expats and investors.\n\nThe rental market in Azerbaijan is also influenced by the country's **education spend**, which is around 3.7% of the GDP, and **health expenditure per capita**, which is around $300. The **out-of-pocket health spend** is relatively high at 64.6%, which may affect the overall cost of living in the country. Additionally, the country's **currency**, the Azerbaijani manat (AZN), has been relatively stable in recent years, making it easier for expats and investors to navigate the local market.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $250-$400 | $150-$300 | typical quality, furnished |\n| 1 Bedroom | $350-$600 | $200-$400 | what to expect, modern amenities |\n| 2 Bedroom | $500-$900 | $300-$600 | family size, spacious |\n| 3 Bedroom | $800-$1,200 | $500-$900 | spacious, luxury amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $1,500-$3,000 | prime locations, modern buildings |\n| Suburbs | $1,000-$2,000 | residential areas, family-friendly |\n| Rural | $500-$1,000 | if applicable, traditional villages |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Baku Downtown**: $400-$700 USD per month for a one-bedroom apartment, modern amenities, and a vibrant nightlife\n- **Nasimi**: $300-$600 USD per month for a one-bedroom apartment, family-friendly neighborhood with easy access to the city center\n- **Sabail**: $250-$500 USD per month for a one-bedroom apartment, historic neighborhood with a mix of old and new buildings\n- **Yasamal**: $200-$400 USD per month for a one-bedroom apartment, residential area with a suburban feel\n- **Binagadi**: $150-$300 USD per month for a one-bedroom apartment, suburban neighborhood with a mix of old and new buildings\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Azerbaijan [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods and prices before starting your housing search to get a sense of the local market\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent to find a suitable apartment and avoid scams\n- Always inspect the property before signing a lease agreement and take photos of any damages\n- Utilities such as electricity, water, and gas are usually included in the rent, but internet and TV may be extra\n- Furnished apartments are common, but it's essential to clarify what is included in the rent and what is not\n- Be prepared to negotiate the price, especially for long-term rentals or outside the city center\n- Consider learning some basic Azerbaijani phrases to help with communication and navigation of the local market",
