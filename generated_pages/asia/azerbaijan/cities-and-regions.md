[SECTION] How Azerbaijan Is Divided [/SECTION]
Azerbaijan is divided into several administrative divisions, including 66 rayons, 11 cities, and 1 autonomous republic, known as the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The country is further divided into 10 economic regions, which were established to promote economic development and investment in different parts of the country. The administrative structure of Azerbaijan is designed to provide a high level of autonomy to local governments, allowing them to manage their own affairs and make decisions that are in the best interests of their communities.

The division of Azerbaijan into different regions and cities is based on a combination of geographical, economic, and cultural factors. The country's mountainous terrain, for example, has played a significant role in shaping the development of its regions, with many cities and towns located in valleys and low-lying areas. The economy of Azerbaijan is also an important factor, with the oil and gas industry playing a major role in the development of the country's coastal regions.
