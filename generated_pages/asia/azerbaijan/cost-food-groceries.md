Azerbaijan's food prices are generally lower compared to the regional average, with a mix of traditional and modern dining options available. The country's strategic location and trade relationships with neighboring countries contribute to the relatively low prices of food items. However, prices can be driven up by factors such as transportation costs, seasonal fluctuations, and import duties. Eating out is a popular culture in Azerbaijan, especially in the capital city of Baku, where restaurants and cafes offer a wide range of local and international cuisine. On the other hand, home cooking is also common, with many Azerbaijanis preparing traditional dishes such as plov, shashlik, and dolma using fresh ingredients from local markets.

[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]
The prices of food items can vary significantly between supermarkets and local markets in Azerbaijan. Supermarkets tend to have higher prices due to the convenience and wide range of products they offer, while local markets and bazaars tend to have lower prices due to the competitive nature of the vendors. For example, a kilogram of apples may cost around $1.50 at a local market, while the same item may cost around $2.50 at a supermarket. When shopping at local markets, it's common to bargain and negotiate prices, especially for bulk purchases. On the other hand, supermarkets tend to have fixed prices, and bargaining is not common.

In general, it's recommended to buy fresh produce, meat, and dairy products at local markets, where the prices tend to be lower and the quality tends to be higher. Supermarkets, on the other hand, are better for buying packaged goods, international products, and convenience items. Additionally, some supermarkets may offer discounts and promotions, especially for loyalty card holders, which can help reduce the overall cost of groceries. Overall, a combination of shopping at local markets and supermarkets can help Azerbaijanis and visitors alike to save money and enjoy a wide range of food options.
