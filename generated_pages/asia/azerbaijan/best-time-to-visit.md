[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Azerbaijan has a diverse climate, with nine out of eleven **climate zones** present in the country. The best time to visit Azerbaijan depends on the region and the activities you have planned. The country experiences a dry season from May to October, with very little rainfall, and a wet season from November to April, with most of the precipitation falling in the winter months. The **dry season** is ideal for visiting the cities and low-lying areas, while the **wet season** is better suited for visiting the mountainous regions, where the scenery is more lush and green.

The seasons in Azerbaijan have a significant impact on travel, with the summer months being the peak tourist season. However, the summer heat can be extreme, especially in the capital city of Baku, making it essential to plan your itinerary accordingly. The spring and autumn seasons, on the other hand, offer mild and pleasant weather, making them ideal for sightseeing and outdoor activities.

Azerbaijan's diverse climate and geography also mean that the weather can vary significantly from one region to another. The **Greater Caucasus Mountains** run along the northern border of the country, creating a rain shadow effect that results in a dry and semi-arid climate in the eastern and central regions. The **Lesser Caucasus Mountains** in the west have a more temperate climate, with significant precipitation throughout the year.
