However, the quality of these services can vary depending on the location and the provider. The costs of utilities in Azerbaijan are generally stable, but they can fluctuate depending on the season. For example, electricity and gas costs may be higher during the winter months when demand is higher. The Azerbaijani government has implemented measures to reduce the cost of utilities, including subsidizing electricity and gas prices for low-income households.\n\nThe cost of utilities in Azerbaijan can also vary depending on the region. For example, the cost of electricity and gas may be higher in the capital city of Baku compared to other parts of the country. Additionally, the cost of utilities can vary depending on the type of accommodation, with apartments in modern buildings tend to have higher utility costs compared to older buildings.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $30 | $50 | $70 | |\n| Water | $10 | $15 | $20 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $5 | $10 | $15 | (included in rent) |\n| **Total** | **$65** | **$105** | **$145** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $20-30 | 10-20 Mbps | Azertelecom, Baktelecom |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $50-70 | 50-100 Mbps | Azertelecom, Baktelecom |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $5-10 | 1-5 GB | Azercell, Bakcell |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $10-20 | 5-10 GB | Azercell, Bakcell |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $30-50 | varies | Azertelecom, Baktelecom |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (if applicable) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Azerbaijan, you will need to provide proof of residence and identification to the service provider.\n- Prepaid electricity meters are available, which can help you save money by only paying for the electricity you use.\n- The best internet providers in Azerbaijan are Azertelecom and Baktelecom, which offer fast and reliable internet services.\n- To save on utility bills, consider using energy-efficient appliances and turning off lights and electronics when not in use.\n- It is also a good idea to negotiate with your landlord to include utility costs in your rent, which can help you budget and save money.",
