The country is further divided into 10 economic regions, which were established to promote economic development and investment in different parts of the country. The administrative structure of Azerbaijan is designed to provide a high level of autonomy to local governments, allowing them to manage their own affairs and make decisions that are in the best interests of their communities.\n\nThe division of Azerbaijan into different regions and cities is based on a combination of geographical, economic, and cultural factors. The country's mountainous terrain, for example, has played a significant role in shaping the development of its regions, with many cities and towns located in valleys and low-lying areas. The economy of Azerbaijan is also an important factor, with the oil and gas industry playing a major role in the development of the country's coastal regions.\n\n[SECTION] Major Cities [/SECTION]\n**Baku** (2.3M)\nRole: capital, economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: its historic old town, modern architecture, and vibrant cultural scene\nBest For: visitors interested in history, culture, and entertainment\n\n**Ganja** (330,000)\nRole: cultural center, economic hub\nKnown For: its historic landmarks, including the Imamzadeh complex and the Juma Mosque\nBest For: visitors interested in history, culture, and religion\n\n**Sumgait** (340,000)\nRole: industrial center, economic hub\nKnown For: its chemical and manufacturing industries, as well as its vibrant cultural scene\nBest For: visitors interested in industry, economy, and culture\n\n**Lankaran** (50,000)\nRole: port city, economic hub\nKnown For: its historic landmarks, including the Lankaran Fortress and the Kichik Amirjan Mosque\nBest For: visitors interested in history, culture, and trade\n\n**Mingachevir** (100,000)\nRole: industrial center, economic hub\nKnown For: its hydroelectric power plant and its vibrant cultural scene\nBest For: visitors interested in industry, economy, and culture\n\n**Nakhchivan** (75,000)\nRole: capital of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, cultural center\nKnown For: its historic landmarks, including the Momuna Khatun Mausoleum and the Yusuf ibn Kuseyir Mausoleum\nBest For: visitors interested in history, culture, and politics\n\n**Shaki** (65,000)\nRole: cultural center, economic hub\nKnown For: its historic landmarks, including the Shaki Khan's Palace and the Juma Mosque\nBest For: visitors interested in history, culture, and trade\n\n**Yevlakh** (60,000)\nRole: transportation hub, economic center\nKnown For: its strategic location, which makes it an important center for trade and commerce\nBest For: visitors interested in economy, trade, and transportation\n\n[SECTION] Key Regions [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Region | Character | Known For | Major City |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Absheron | Coastal, urban | Oil and gas industry, historic landmarks | Baku |\n| Ganja-Gazakh | Mountainous, rural | Historic landmarks, cultural heritage | Ganja |\n| Lankaran-Astara | Coastal, rural | Historic landmarks, trade and commerce | Lankaran |\n| Sheki-Zagatala | Mountainous, rural | Historic landmarks, cultural heritage | Shaki |\n| Upper Karabakh | Mountainous, rural | Historic landmarks, cultural heritage | Stepanakert |\n| Nakhchivan | Mountainous, rural | Historic landmarks, cultural heritage | Nakhchivan |\n| Aran | Lowland, rural | Agriculture, trade and commerce | Yevlakh |\n| Shirvan | Coastal, urban | Oil and gas industry, historic landmarks | Sumgait |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Differences [/SECTION]\n- The regions of Azerbaijan differ significantly in terms of their geography, economy, and culture, with the coastal regions being more urban and industrial, while the mountainous regions are more rural and traditional.\n- The economy of Azerbaijan is also a major factor in regional differences, with the oil and gas industry playing a dominant role in the coastal regions, while agriculture and trade are more important in the rural areas.\n- The climate of Azerbaijan also varies significantly from region to region, with the coastal regions having a more temperate climate, while the mountainous regions are colder and more prone to snow.\n- The language and culture of Azerbaijan also differ from region to region, with the Azerbaijani language being spoken throughout the country, but with different dialects and cultural traditions in different regions.\n\n[SECTION] Getting Around [/SECTION]\nAzerbaijan has a well-developed transportation network, with domestic flights, trains, buses, and taxis available. The country's main airport is located in Baku, and there are also several smaller airports in other cities, including Ganja and Nakhchivan. The train network in Azerbaijan is also well-developed, with regular services connecting Baku to other major cities, including Ganja, Sumgait, and Lankaran.
