        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Azerbaijan, located in the South Caucasus region, has a rich and diverse history that spans over 2,000 years. The area was first inhabited by various ancient civilizations, including the Medes, Persians, and Arabs. In the 11th century, Azerbaijan was invaded by the Seljuk Turks, who introduced the Turkish language and Islamic culture to the region. The country was later conquered by the Mongols in the 13th century and became part of the Golden Horde. In the 16th century, Azerbaijan was absorbed into the Safavid Empire, which played a significant role in shaping the country's culture and identity.</p>
        <p>In the 19th century, Azerbaijan was annexed by the Russian Empire, and it remained under Russian rule until the Russian Revolution in 1917. Following the revolution, Azerbaijan declared its independence and became the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, which was the first democratic and secular republic in the Muslim world. However, this independence was short-lived, as Azerbaijan was soon incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1920. The country remained a Soviet Socialist Republic until it regained its independence in 1991, following the dissolution of the Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>Azerbaijan's modern history is marked by its struggle for independence and self-determination. The country has been involved in several conflicts, including the Nagorno-Karabakh War with Armenia, which has resulted in the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people and a prolonged dispute over the region's status. Today, Azerbaijan is a <strong>sovereign</strong> state, with a <strong>presidential</strong> system of government and a diverse economy that is driven by its rich oil and gas reserves.</p>
        <p>Azerbaijan's cultural heritage is a unique blend of Eastern and Western influences, reflecting its strategic location at the crossroads of Europe and Asia. The country is home to a diverse range of ethnic and linguistic groups, including Azerbaijanis, Lezgins, and Talysh, among others. The official language is <strong>Azerbaijani</strong>, which is a Turkic language that is closely related to Turkish and other languages spoken in the region.</p>
        <h2>Common Misconceptions</h2>
        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "Azerbaijan is an Arab country"</p>
        <p>Reality: Azerbaijan is a <strong>Turkic</strong> country, with a unique cultural and linguistic identity that is distinct from Arab countries. While Azerbaijan is a Muslim-majority country, its culture and traditions are shaped by its Turkic heritage and its location at the crossroads of Europe and Asia. [/CALLOUT]</p>
        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "Azerbaijan is a desert country"</p>

The country has a rich cultural heritage, with a unique blend of Turkic, Persian, and Russian influences, and its people are known for their hospitality and warm welcome to visitors. [/CALLOUT]</p>
        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "Azerbaijan is a closed country with limited international connections"</p>
        <p>Reality: Azerbaijan is a <strong>globally connected</strong> country, with direct flights to major cities in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.
