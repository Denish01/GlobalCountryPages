[SECTION] Overview: Azerbaijan vs Georgia [/SECTION]
Azerbaijan and Georgia are two neighboring countries in the Caucasus region, each with its unique culture, history, and economic context. Azerbaijan has a higher GDP per capita and a more developed oil industry, which contributes to its higher cost of living. In contrast, Georgia has a more diverse economy with a strong focus on tourism, agriculture, and manufacturing, which helps to keep costs lower. The difference in cost of living between the two countries is noticeable, with Georgia being generally cheaper for accommodation, food, and transportation.

The economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Azerbaijan's economy is heavily reliant on oil exports, which can lead to fluctuations in the cost of living depending on global oil prices. Georgia, on the other hand, has a more stable economy with a growing service sector, which helps to keep prices stable. Overall, Georgia is a more affordable option for expats, students, and retirees, while Azerbaijan is more suited for those with a higher budget or those who are looking for a more luxurious lifestyle.
