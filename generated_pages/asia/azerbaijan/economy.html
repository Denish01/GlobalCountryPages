        <h2>Economic Overview</h2>
        <p>Azerbaijan has an upper-middle-income economy, driven primarily by its oil and gas sector. The country's economy has experienced significant growth over the past two decades, with GDP increasing from $1.3 billion in 1991 to $43 billion in 2020. This growth has been fueled by large-scale foreign investment in the energy sector, as well as a series of economic reforms aimed at diversifying the economy and improving the business environment. Today, Azerbaijan is considered one of the most economically developed countries in the South Caucasus region.</p>
        <p>Azerbaijan's economic development level is characterized by a high level of human development, with a strong focus on education and healthcare. The country has made significant progress in reducing poverty, with the poverty rate declining from 49% in 2001 to 5% in 2020. However, the economy still faces challenges related to corruption, bureaucratic inefficiencies, and a lack of economic diversification. The government has implemented a number of initiatives aimed at addressing these challenges, including the creation of a new economic zone and the introduction of tax incentives for foreign investors.</p>
        <p>The country's economic trajectory is expected to continue on a positive path, driven by the ongoing development of the energy sector and the growth of non-oil sectors such as agriculture, manufacturing, and tourism. The government has set a target of reducing the country's dependence on oil exports, with a goal of increasing the share of non-oil exports in total exports to 30% by 2025. To achieve this goal, the government is investing in the development of new industries, including IT and telecommunications, and is providing support to small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
