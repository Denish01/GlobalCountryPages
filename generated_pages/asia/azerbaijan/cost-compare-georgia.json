Azerbaijan has a higher GDP per capita and a more developed oil industry, which contributes to its higher cost of living. In contrast, Georgia has a more diverse economy with a strong focus on tourism, agriculture, and manufacturing, which helps to keep costs lower. The difference in cost of living between the two countries is noticeable, with Georgia being generally cheaper for accommodation, food, and transportation.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Azerbaijan's economy is heavily reliant on oil exports, which can lead to fluctuations in the cost of living depending on global oil prices. Georgia, on the other hand, has a more stable economy with a growing service sector, which helps to keep prices stable. Overall, Georgia is a more affordable option for expats, students, and retirees, while Azerbaijan is more suited for those with a higher budget or those who are looking for a more luxurious lifestyle.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Azerbaijan (USD) | Georgia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 350 | 250 | 29% cheaper in Georgia |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 200 | 150 | 25% cheaper in Georgia |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 600 | 450 | 25% cheaper in Georgia |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Azerbaijan (USD) | Georgia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 10 | 8 | 20% cheaper in Georgia |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 300 | 250 | 17% cheaper in Georgia |\n| Beer (500ml) | 2 | 1.5 | 25% cheaper in Georgia |\n| Coffee | 3 | 2 | 33% cheaper in Georgia |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Azerbaijan (USD) | Georgia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 20 | 15 | 25% cheaper in Georgia |\n| Taxi (per km) | 0.5 | 0.3 | 40% cheaper in Georgia |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 0.8 | 0.7 | 12% cheaper in Georgia |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Azerbaijan (USD) | Georgia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 100 | 80 | 20% cheaper in Georgia |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 30 | 25 | 17% cheaper in Georgia |\n| Mobile Plan | 10 | 8 | 20% cheaper in Georgia |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Azerbaijan (USD) | Georgia (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 800 | 600 | 25% savings in Georgia |\n| Mid-Range | 1,200 | 900 | 25% savings in Georgia |\n| Comfortable | 2,000 | 1,500 | 25% savings in Georgia |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Azerbaijan is cheaper for:**\n- High-end shopping and luxury goods\n- Fine dining and upscale restaurants\n- International flights and travel\n- High-speed internet and advanced technology\n- **Georgia is cheaper for:**\n- Accommodation and housing\n- Food and dining\n- Transportation and fuel\n- Utilities and internet\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nGeorgia is the clear winner when it comes to cost of living, with a significant difference in prices for accommodation, food, and transportation.
