[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Azerbaijan has made significant strides in developing its infrastructure, driven by its growing economy and strategic location at the crossroads of Europe and Asia. The country has invested heavily in modernizing its transportation networks, including roads, railways, and airports, with a focus on improving connectivity and facilitating trade. However, there is still a notable disparity between urban and rural areas, with the capital city Baku and other major urban centers enjoying better infrastructure and services than rural regions. Recent investments have focused on upgrading the country's energy and telecommunications infrastructure, with a view to supporting economic growth and improving the quality of life for citizens.

The government has also implemented various initiatives to promote **public-private partnerships** and attract foreign investment in infrastructure development, with a focus on projects such as road construction, renewable energy, and telecommunications. These efforts have helped to drive growth and improve the overall quality of infrastructure in Azerbaijan. Despite these advances, challenges remain, including the need to upgrade and expand infrastructure in rural areas and to improve the efficiency and reliability of services such as electricity and water supply.

Azerbaijan's infrastructure development is also closely tied to its **regional integration** efforts, including its participation in international organizations and initiatives such as the **European Union's Eastern Partnership** and the **Asian Development Bank**. These efforts aim to promote economic cooperation and integration with neighboring countries and to support the development of regional infrastructure, including transportation networks and energy systems.
