[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
Azerbaijan's education system is divided into public and private institutions, with the public system being the largest provider of education. The quality of public education can vary, with some schools lacking resources and qualified teachers, while private schools generally offer better facilities and more experienced instructors. The language of instruction is primarily Azerbaijani, but some schools may offer instruction in Russian, English, or other languages. Compulsory education in Azerbaijan lasts for 11 years, starting from age 6 and ending at age 17. International schools are available in major cities, offering a range of curricula, including British, American, and International Baccalaureate programs.

The education system in Azerbaijan is overseen by the Ministry of Education, which is responsible for setting curriculum standards, accrediting schools, and overseeing teacher training. While the public education system is generally free or subsidized, private schools and international institutions can be expensive, making them inaccessible to many families. However, the government has implemented programs to improve access to education, including scholarships and subsidies for low-income families. Additionally, some private schools and international institutions offer financial aid and scholarships to qualified students.
