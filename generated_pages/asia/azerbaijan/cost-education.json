The quality of public education can vary, with some schools lacking resources and qualified teachers, while private schools generally offer better facilities and more experienced instructors. The language of instruction is primarily Azerbaijani, but some schools may offer instruction in Russian, English, or other languages. Compulsory education in Azerbaijan lasts for 11 years, starting from age 6 and ending at age 17. International schools are available in major cities, offering a range of curricula, including British, American, and International Baccalaureate programs.\n\nThe education system in Azerbaijan is overseen by the Ministry of Education, which is responsible for setting curriculum standards, accrediting schools, and overseeing teacher training. While the public education system is generally free or subsidized, private schools and international institutions can be expensive, making them inaccessible to many families. However, the government has implemented programs to improve access to education, including scholarships and subsidies for low-income families. Additionally, some private schools and international institutions offer financial aid and scholarships to qualified students.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 (free) | Limited resources and facilities |\n| Private Primary | $1,000-$3,000 | Better facilities and qualified teachers |\n| Public Secondary | $0 (free) | Limited resources and facilities |\n| Private Secondary | $2,000-$5,000 | Better facilities and qualified teachers |\n| International School | $5,000-$10,000 | British, American, or IB curriculum |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $500-$1,000 | $1,000-$2,000 | Limited programs and facilities |\n| Private University | $2,000-$5,000 | $3,000-$6,000 | Better facilities and programs |\n| Top-Ranked University | $3,000-$6,000 | $5,000-$10,000 | Baku State University or Azerbaijan State Oil Academy |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $100-$300 | Limited availability and high demand |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $20-$50 | Popular for exam preparation and language instruction |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $200-$500 | English, Russian, or other languages |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $50-$100 | Basic materials and textbooks |\n| School Uniform | $50-$100 | Required for most schools |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The best schools for expats in Azerbaijan are generally international schools, which offer a range of curricula and languages.\n- Scholarships are available for qualified students, including government-funded programs and private scholarships.\n- Online learning options are limited in Azerbaijan, but some universities and institutions offer distance learning programs.\n- Education quality in Azerbaijan is generally lower compared to other countries in the region, but there are efforts to improve standards and facilities.\n- **Azerbaijani language** skills are essential for navigating the education system and daily life in Azerbaijan.\n- [CALLOUT] It is recommended to research and visit schools before making a decision, as the quality and availability of education can vary significantly depending on the institution and location.",
