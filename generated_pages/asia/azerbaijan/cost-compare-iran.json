  "content": "Azerbaijan is generally more expensive than Iran, with an overall cost of living difference of around 20-30%.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nAzerbaijan GDP per Capita (PPP): 14,404\nIran GDP per Capita (PPP): 11,124\nAzerbaijan Inflation Rate: 3.5%\nIran Inflation Rate: 26.4%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Iran\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Azerbaijan vs Iran [/SECTION]\nAzerbaijan and Iran are two neighboring countries in the South Caucasus region, with distinct economic profiles and cost of living. Azerbaijan has a higher GDP per capita and a more stable economy, driven by its oil and gas exports. In contrast, Iran has a larger population and a more diverse economy, but faces economic challenges due to international sanctions and a high inflation rate. As a result, Azerbaijan tends to be more expensive than Iran, particularly when it comes to housing, transportation, and utilities.\n\nThe cost of living difference between the two countries is significant, with Azerbaijan being around 20-30% more expensive than Iran. However, the cost of living in both countries can vary greatly depending on the location, lifestyle, and personal preferences. For example, Baku, the capital city of Azerbaijan, is a major hub for oil and gas companies, and has a relatively high cost of living, while Tehran, the capital city of Iran, has a more affordable cost of living. Overall, Iran is the cheaper option for expats, students, and retirees, while Azerbaijan may be more suitable for those with a higher income or a specific job opportunity.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Azerbaijan (USD) | Iran (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 450 | 250 | 80% more expensive |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 250 | 150 | 67% more expensive |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 800 | 450 | 78% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Azerbaijan (USD) | Iran (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 10 | 5 | 100% more expensive |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 300 | 200 | 50% more expensive |\n| Beer (500ml) | 3 | 2 | 50% more expensive |\n| Coffee | 2 | 1.5 | 33% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Azerbaijan (USD) | Iran (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 20 | 10 | 100% more expensive |\n| Taxi (per km) | 0.5 | 0.3 | 67% more expensive |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 0.6 | 0.4 | 50% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Azerbaijan (USD) | Iran (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 100 | 60 | 67% more expensive |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 30 | 20 | 50% more expensive |\n| Mobile Plan | 10 | 5 | 100% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Azerbaijan (USD) | Iran (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 800 | 500 | 37% |\n| Mid-Range | 1,200 | 800 | 33% |\n| Comfortable | 2,000 | 1,200 | 40% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Azerbaijan is cheaper for:**\n- High-end shopping and dining experiences\n- Luxury hotels and resorts\n- International flights and travel\n- Modern amenities and infrastructure\n- **Iran is cheaper for:**\n- Affordable housing and rent\n- Local transportation and taxi fares\n- Traditional food and dining experiences\n- Historical and cultural attractions\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nWhen it comes to choosing between Azerbaijan and Iran, the decision ultimately depends on your lifestyle, budget, and personal preferences.
