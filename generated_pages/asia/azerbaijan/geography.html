        <h2>Location & Borders</h2>
        <p>Azerbaijan is a sovereign country located in the South Caucasus region of Asia. It is bordered by several countries, including Russia to the north, Georgia to the northwest, Armenia to the west, Iran to the south, and Turkey to the southwest. The country also has a coastline along the Caspian Sea to the east, which provides a significant source of oil and natural gas reserves. Azerbaijan's strategic location at the crossroads of Europe and Asia makes it an important hub for trade and cultural exchange.</p>
        <p>Azerbaijan's borders are characterized by a mix of mountainous and flat terrain, with several major rivers flowing through the country. The Greater Caucasus Mountains form the northern border with Russia, while the Lesser Caucasus Mountains run along the western border with Armenia and Turkey. The country's southern border with Iran is marked by the Aras River, which also forms part of the border with Turkey. Azerbaijan's diverse geography and climate have created a wide range of ecosystems, from temperate forests to arid deserts, supporting a rich variety of flora and fauna.</p>
        <h2>Terrain & Landscape</h2>
        <p>Azerbaijan's terrain is characterized by a mix of mountains, valleys, and coastal plains. The Greater Caucasus Mountains, which stretch from Russia to Azerbaijan, are the highest mountain range in the country, with peaks reaching over 4,000 meters. The Lesser Caucasus Mountains, which run along the western border, are lower in elevation but still provide a scenic backdrop to the surrounding countryside. The Kura and Aras rivers, which flow through the country, have created fertile valleys and plains that support agriculture and urban development.</p>
        <p>The coastal plain along the Caspian Sea is a low-lying area of sandy beaches, salt marshes, and oil fields. The Absheron Peninsula, which juts out into the Caspian Sea, is a barren and rocky area with limited vegetation. In contrast, the Lankaran Lowland, which lies along the southern coast, is a tropical region with dense forests and a rich variety of wildlife. Azerbaijan's diverse terrain and climate have created a wide range of ecosystems, from temperate forests to arid deserts, supporting a rich variety of flora and fauna.</p>
        <p>Azerbaijan's landscape is also characterized by several major rivers, including the Kura, Aras, and Kura-Aras Lowland. These rivers have created fertile valleys and plains that support agriculture and urban development. The country's terrain has also been shaped by its complex geological history, with several major fault lines and volcanic regions. The <strong>Mud Volcanoes</strong> of Azerbaijan, which are found in the Absheron Peninsula and other areas, are a unique geological feature that attracts tourists and scientists alike.</p>
