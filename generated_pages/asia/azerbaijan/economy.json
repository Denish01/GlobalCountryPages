The country's economy has experienced significant growth over the past two decades, with GDP increasing from $1.3 billion in 1991 to $43 billion in 2020. This growth has been fueled by large-scale foreign investment in the energy sector, as well as a series of economic reforms aimed at diversifying the economy and improving the business environment. Today, Azerbaijan is considered one of the most economically developed countries in the South Caucasus region.\n\nAzerbaijan's economic development level is characterized by a high level of human development, with a strong focus on education and healthcare. The country has made significant progress in reducing poverty, with the poverty rate declining from 49% in 2001 to 5% in 2020. However, the economy still faces challenges related to corruption, bureaucratic inefficiencies, and a lack of economic diversification. The government has implemented a number of initiatives aimed at addressing these challenges, including the creation of a new economic zone and the introduction of tax incentives for foreign investors.\n\nThe country's economic trajectory is expected to continue on a positive path, driven by the ongoing development of the energy sector and the growth of non-oil sectors such as agriculture, manufacturing, and tourism. The government has set a target of reducing the country's dependence on oil exports, with a goal of increasing the share of non-oil exports in total exports to 30% by 2025.
