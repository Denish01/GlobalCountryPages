[SECTION] Overview: Azerbaijan vs Iran [/SECTION]
Azerbaijan and Iran are two neighboring countries in the South Caucasus region, with distinct economic profiles and cost of living. Azerbaijan has a higher GDP per capita and a more stable economy, driven by its oil and gas exports. In contrast, Iran has a larger population and a more diverse economy, but faces economic challenges due to international sanctions and a high inflation rate. As a result, Azerbaijan tends to be more expensive than Iran, particularly when it comes to housing, transportation, and utilities.

The cost of living difference between the two countries is significant, with Azerbaijan being around 20-30% more expensive than Iran. However, the cost of living in both countries can vary greatly depending on the location, lifestyle, and personal preferences. For example, Baku, the capital city of Azerbaijan, is a major hub for oil and gas companies, and has a relatively high cost of living, while Tehran, the capital city of Iran, has a more affordable cost of living. Overall, Iran is the cheaper option for expats, students, and retirees, while Azerbaijan may be more suitable for those with a higher income or a specific job opportunity.
