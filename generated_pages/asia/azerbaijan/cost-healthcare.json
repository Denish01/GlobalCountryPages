  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Azerbaijan varies significantly between public and private institutions, with out-of-pocket expenses accounting for a substantial portion of total healthcare expenditure, at around 64.6% of the total.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $300 (2023)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 64.6% (2023)\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 103\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: AZN\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nAzerbaijan has a mixed healthcare system, comprising both public and private institutions. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to the private sector, with limited resources and outdated equipment. Locals often rely on the public system, while foreigners and those who can afford it tend to opt for private healthcare. The system is not universal, and patients often need to pay out-of-pocket for services, making health insurance a recommended option for those living in or visiting Azerbaijan. The government has been working to improve the healthcare system, but progress has been slow, and significant challenges remain.\n\nThe healthcare system in Azerbaijan is not very foreigner-friendly, with limited English spoken by medical staff, especially outside of Baku. However, some private hospitals and clinics cater specifically to foreigners and offer high-quality care with English-speaking staff. These institutions often have partnerships with international insurance providers, making it easier for foreigners to access care. For locals, the public system is often the only option, and they may face long wait times and limited access to specialized care. In recent years, the government has introduced some reforms aimed at improving the public healthcare system, including increasing funding and introducing new technologies.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $5-$10 | $20-$50 | Public hospitals often have long wait times |\n| Specialist Consultation | $10-$20 | $50-$100 | Private clinics offer more specialized care |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-$20 | $30-$70 | Private dentists often have more modern equipment |\n| Eye Exam | $5-$10 | $20-$50 | Public hospitals may not have the latest technology |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $20-$50 | Private labs often offer faster results |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $20-$50 | Public hospitals often have limited resources |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $50-$100 | Private hospitals offer more comfortable accommodations |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$1,000 | Private clinics often have more experienced surgeons |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,000-$2,000 | Private hospitals offer more personalized care |\n| MRI Scan | $100-$200 | Private clinics often have more modern equipment |\n| X-Ray | $20-$50 | Public hospitals may have older machines |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Public hospital care, basic procedures |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-$200 | Private hospital care, specialized procedures, dental and vision |\n| International / Expat | $200-$500 | Worldwide coverage, emergency evacuation, high-end care |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medication can be purchased at pharmacies with a doctor's prescription, with costs ranging from $5-$20 for basic medications.\n- Over-the-counter medication is widely available, with prices similar to those in other countries.\n- Pharmacies are readily available in cities, but may be scarce in rural areas.\n- Some medications may be difficult to find, especially in rural areas.\n- Prices for medication can vary significantly depending on the pharmacy and location.\n- It is recommended to bring any necessary prescription medication with you when traveling to Azerbaijan, as availability and quality may be limited.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the emergency number, 103, or go to the nearest hospital. Ambulance services are available, but may not always be reliable, especially outside of Baku. For foreigners, it is often best to go to a private hospital, as they tend to have better equipment and more experienced staff. Some of the best hospitals for foreigners in Baku include the Central Hospital and the Mediclub Hospital, which offer high-quality care and have English-speaking staff. It is also recommended to have health insurance that covers emergency care, as costs can quickly add up. In the event of a serious emergency, evacuation to a neighboring country or Europe may be necessary, highlighting the importance of having adequate health insurance coverage.",
