[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Azerbaijan's rental market is relatively **moderate** in terms of affordability, with prices increasing in recent years due to the country's growing economy. The typical lease term in Azerbaijan is one year, with a deposit requirement of one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected by law, but it is still essential for renters to carefully review their lease agreements before signing. Compared to its regional neighbors, Azerbaijan's housing costs are relatively **high**, especially in the capital city of Baku. However, the country's **low inflation rate** of 2.2% and **high GDP per capita** of $25,089 make it an attractive destination for expats and investors.

The rental market in Azerbaijan is also influenced by the country's **education spend**, which is around 3.7% of the GDP, and **health expenditure per capita**, which is around $300. The **out-of-pocket health spend** is relatively high at 64.6%, which may affect the overall cost of living in the country. Additionally, the country's **currency**, the Azerbaijani manat (AZN), has been relatively stable in recent years, making it easier for expats and investors to navigate the local market.
