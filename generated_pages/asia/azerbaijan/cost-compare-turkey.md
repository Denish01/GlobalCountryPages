[SECTION] Overview: Azerbaijan vs Turkey [/SECTION]
Azerbaijan and Turkey are two neighboring countries in the region, with distinct economic contexts and cost levels. Azerbaijan has a relatively lower cost of living, driven by its lower labor costs, rent, and food prices. In contrast, Turkey has a more developed economy and a higher cost of living, influenced by its strategic location, large population, and growing tourism industry. Overall, Azerbaijan offers a more affordable lifestyle, with prices that are around 15-20% lower than in Turkey. This makes it an attractive option for expats, students, and retirees looking for a budget-friendly destination.

The economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in shaping their cost levels. Azerbaijan's economy is largely driven by its oil and gas sector, which has contributed to its rapid growth and development. However, this has also led to a relatively high level of income inequality and a limited range of job opportunities in other sectors. Turkey, on the other hand, has a more diversified economy, with a strong focus on manufacturing, tourism, and services. This has contributed to its higher cost of living, but also provides a more stable and secure environment for investors and businesses. As a result, Turkey may be a more attractive option for those looking for a more developed economy and a wider range of job opportunities.
