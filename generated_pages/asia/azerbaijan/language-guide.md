[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]
Azerbaijan has a diverse linguistic landscape, with Azerbaijani being the dominant language spoken by the majority of the population. There are several regional dialects, including the Baku dialect, which is considered the standard form of the language. Minority languages, such as Lezgian and Avar, are also spoken in certain regions. English is not widely understood, particularly outside of the capital city Baku, where it is more commonly spoken among the younger population and those in the tourism industry. However, many Azerbaijanis speak Russian as a second language, which can be useful for visitors who are familiar with the language. The use of English is becoming more prevalent, especially in business and tourism, but it is still not as common as in other European countries.

The linguistic diversity of Azerbaijan is also reflected in the country's history and cultural heritage. The language has been influenced by various cultures, including Persian, Arabic, and Turkish, which has resulted in a unique blend of languages and dialects. Visitors to Azerbaijan can experience this linguistic diversity firsthand by visiting different regions and interacting with the local population. Overall, while Azerbaijani is the dominant language, the country's linguistic landscape is complex and multifaceted, reflecting its strategic location at the crossroads of Europe and Asia.

Azerbaijan's language policy has also undergone significant changes in recent years, with a shift from the Cyrillic script to the Latin script. This change has been aimed at promoting the use of the Azerbaijani language and reducing the influence of Russian. As a result, visitors to Azerbaijan may notice that many signs and documents are now written in the Latin script, which can make it easier for English-speaking visitors to navigate the country.
