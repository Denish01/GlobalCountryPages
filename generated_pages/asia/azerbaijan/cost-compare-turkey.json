  "content": "Azerbaijan is generally cheaper than Turkey, with an overall cost of living that is around 15-20% lower.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nAzerbaijan GDP per Capita (PPP): 14,400\nTurkey GDP per Capita (PPP): 24,900\nAzerbaijan Inflation Rate: 3.5%\nTurkey Inflation Rate: 12.2%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Azerbaijan\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Azerbaijan vs Turkey [/SECTION]\nAzerbaijan and Turkey are two neighboring countries in the region, with distinct economic contexts and cost levels. Azerbaijan has a relatively lower cost of living, driven by its lower labor costs, rent, and food prices. In contrast, Turkey has a more developed economy and a higher cost of living, influenced by its strategic location, large population, and growing tourism industry. Overall, Azerbaijan offers a more affordable lifestyle, with prices that are around 15-20% lower than in Turkey. This makes it an attractive option for expats, students, and retirees looking for a budget-friendly destination.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in shaping their cost levels. Azerbaijan's economy is largely driven by its oil and gas sector, which has contributed to its rapid growth and development. However, this has also led to a relatively high level of income inequality and a limited range of job opportunities in other sectors. Turkey, on the other hand, has a more diversified economy, with a strong focus on manufacturing, tourism, and services. This has contributed to its higher cost of living, but also provides a more stable and secure environment for investors and businesses. As a result, Turkey may be a more attractive option for those looking for a more developed economy and a wider range of job opportunities.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Azerbaijan (USD) | Turkey (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 250 | 350 | 28% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 150 | 250 | 40% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 450 | 650 | 31% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Azerbaijan (USD) | Turkey (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 5 | 8 | 37% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 100 | 150 | 33% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | 2 | 3 | 33% cheaper |\n| Coffee | 1.5 | 2.5 | 40% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Azerbaijan (USD) | Turkey (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 10 | 20 | 50% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | 0.5 | 1 | 50% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 0.7 | 1.2 | 42% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Azerbaijan (USD) | Turkey (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 50 | 80 | 37% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 20 | 30 | 33% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | 10 | 20 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Azerbaijan (USD) | Turkey (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 500 | 700 | 28% |\n| Mid-Range | 800 | 1,200 | 33% |\n| Comfortable | 1,200 | 1,800 | 33% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Azerbaijan is cheaper for:**\n- Rent and housing, with prices that are around 30-40% lower than in Turkey\n- Food and dining, with meal prices that are around 30-40% lower than in Turkey\n- Transportation, with taxi and fuel prices that are around 40-50% lower than in Turkey\n- Utilities and internet, with prices that are around 30-50% lower than in Turkey\n- **Turkey is cheaper for:**\n- Certain imported goods, such as electronics and clothing, which may be cheaper in Turkey due to its larger market and stronger economy\n- Travel and tourism, with a wider range of options and destinations available in Turkey\n- Healthcare, with a more developed and modern healthcare system in Turkey\n- Education, with a wider range of international schools and universities available in Turkey\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nAzerbaijan offers a more affordable lifestyle, with prices that are around 15-20% lower than in Turkey.
