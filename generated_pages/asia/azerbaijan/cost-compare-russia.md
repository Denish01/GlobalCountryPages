[SECTION] Overview: Azerbaijan vs Russia [/SECTION]
Azerbaijan and Russia are two neighboring countries with distinct economic profiles. Azerbaijan has a high-income economy driven by its oil and gas industry, while Russia has a mixed economy with a strong focus on energy, manufacturing, and services. Despite their differences, both countries offer a unique cultural experience and a range of amenities for expats and travelers. However, when it comes to the cost of living, Azerbaijan is generally the more affordable option. The country's lower prices for housing, food, and transportation make it an attractive choice for those looking to stretch their budget.

The economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. Azerbaijan's economy has been growing rapidly in recent years, driven by its energy sector, while Russia's economy has been more sluggish due to sanctions and fluctuations in global energy prices. As a result, Azerbaijan has experienced a surge in construction and development, leading to an increase in housing options and a more competitive rental market. In contrast, Russia's economy has been more volatile, leading to higher prices and a more unpredictable cost of living.
