[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Azerbaijan has a relatively well-developed utility infrastructure, with most households having access to electricity, water, and gas. However, the quality of these services can vary depending on the location and the provider. The costs of utilities in Azerbaijan are generally stable, but they can fluctuate depending on the season. For example, electricity and gas costs may be higher during the winter months when demand is higher. The Azerbaijani government has implemented measures to reduce the cost of utilities, including subsidizing electricity and gas prices for low-income households.

The cost of utilities in Azerbaijan can also vary depending on the region. For example, the cost of electricity and gas may be higher in the capital city of Baku compared to other parts of the country. Additionally, the cost of utilities can vary depending on the type of accommodation, with apartments in modern buildings tend to have higher utility costs compared to older buildings.
