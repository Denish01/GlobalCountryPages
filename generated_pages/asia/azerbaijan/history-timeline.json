  "content": "The history of Azerbaijan is a rich and complex narrative that spans thousands of years, from ancient civilizations to modern-day independence. \n\n[SECTION] Historical Overview [/SECTION]\nAzerbaijan's history dates back to the ancient period, with the **Caucasus Albanians** and **Medes** inhabiting the region. The area was later conquered by the **Achaemenid Empire**, followed by the **Alexander the Great**'s empire, and then the **Sassanid Empire**. In the 7th century, Azerbaijan was **Islamized** under the **Arab Caliphate**, which had a profound impact on the region's culture and identity. The **Safavid dynasty**, which ruled from the 16th to the 18th century, played a significant role in shaping Azerbaijan's history, particularly in terms of its **Shi'a Islamic** heritage.\n\nThe 19th century saw Azerbaijan become part of the **Russian Empire**, which had a lasting impact on the country's economy, politics, and culture. The early 20th century was marked by the **Azerbaijan Democratic Republic**, which was established in 1918 and existed until 1920. This period was significant, as it marked the country's first taste of independence. However, Azerbaijan soon became part of the **Soviet Union**, which ruled the country for nearly seven decades. The Soviet period was marked by significant economic development, particularly in the oil and gas sector, but also by repression and limited cultural expression.\n\nIn the modern era, Azerbaijan has continued to navigate its complex history and cultural identity. The country has made significant strides in terms of economic development, particularly in the oil and gas sector, but has also faced challenges related to democracy, human rights, and regional conflicts. The **Nagorno-Karabakh conflict** with Armenia has been a major point of contention, with ongoing tensions and disputes over territory and sovereignty. Despite these challenges, Azerbaijan has continued to assert its independence and sovereignty, while also seeking to engage with the global community and promote its rich cultural heritage.\n\nThe country's strategic location at the crossroads of Europe and Asia has made it an important player in regional politics and economics. Azerbaijan has sought to balance its relationships with major powers, including **Russia**, **Turkey**, and **Iran**, while also pursuing its own national interests and priorities. This has involved a delicate balancing act, as the country seeks to maintain its sovereignty and independence while also navigating the complex geopolitics of the region.\n\n[SECTION] Timeline of Key Events [/SECTION]\n1. **9th century BC** - The **Caucasus Albanians** and **Medes** inhabit the region, with the area later being conquered by the **Achaemenid Empire**. \n2. **7th century AD** - Azerbaijan is **Islamized** under the **Arab Caliphate**, which has a profound impact on the region's culture and identity.\n3. **16th century** - The **Safavid dynasty** rules Azerbaijan, playing a significant role in shaping the country's history and **Shi'a Islamic** heritage.\n4. **1813** - The **Treaty of Gulistan** is signed, marking the beginning of **Russian rule** in Azerbaijan.\n5. **1918** - The **Azerbaijan Democratic Republic** is established, marking the country's first taste of independence.\n6. **1920** - Azerbaijan becomes part of the **Soviet Union**, which rules the country for nearly seven decades.\n7. **1988** - The **Nagorno-Karabakh conflict** begins, with ongoing tensions and disputes over territory and sovereignty.\n8. **1991** - Azerbaijan declares its independence from the **Soviet Union**, marking the beginning of a new era in the country's history.\n9. **1993** - **Heydar Aliyev** becomes president, playing a significant role in shaping the country's post-independence trajectory.\n10. **2003** - **Ilham Aliyev** becomes president, succeeding his father and continuing to shape the country's politics and economy.\n11. **2010** - Azerbaijan begins to develop its **Shah Deniz gas field**, marking a significant milestone in the country's energy sector.\n12. **2013** - The **Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway** is completed, improving transportation links between Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey.\n13. **2016** - Azerbaijan launches the **Southern Gas Corridor**, a major energy project aimed at transporting gas from the Caspian Sea to Europe.\n14. **2020** - The **Nagorno-Karabakh conflict** escalates, resulting in a significant humanitarian crisis and ongoing tensions.\n15. **2021** - Azerbaijan continues to navigate its complex relationships with regional powers, including **Russia**, **Turkey**, and **Iran**.\n\n[SECTION] Founding & Formation [/SECTION]\nAzerbaijan's founding and formation as a modern nation-state is a complex and multifaceted process.
