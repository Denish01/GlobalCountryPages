# Azerbaijan Visa & Entry Requirements

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Azerbaijan before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Azerbaijan has a moderate visa policy, with a mix of visa-free access, visa on arrival, and required visas for different nationalities. Citizens of around 10 countries can enter Azerbaijan visa-free, while many others can obtain a visa on arrival or through an electronic visa system. The country has been working to simplify its visa process and attract more tourists, making it easier for visitors to explore its rich culture and history.

Azerbaijan's visa policy is designed to balance security concerns with the need to promote tourism and economic development. The country has introduced an electronic visa system, which allows citizens of eligible countries to apply for a visa online and receive it via email. This has simplified the process and reduced waiting times, making it more convenient for travelers to plan their trips.

[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]
**Tourists:** Citizens of eligible countries can obtain an eVisa, which is valid for a maximum stay of 30 days. The typical stay for tourists is 7-10 days, and extensions are possible but require an application to the State Migration Service. **Business Travelers:** Business travelers may require an invitation letter from an Azerbaijani company, and must apply for a business visa. The requirements and process differ from those for tourists, and business travelers should check with the embassy or consulate for specific requirements. **Students:** Students must provide proof of enrollment at an Azerbaijani university and apply for a student visa. The duration of the visa will depend on the length of the course of study. **Workers:** Workers must have a sponsorship from an Azerbaijani employer and apply for a work visa. The process can be complex, and workers should check with the embassy or consulate for specific requirements.

[SECTION] Documents Checklist [/SECTION]
1. A valid passport with at least six months' validity
2. Completed visa application form
3. Recent passport-sized photo
4. Proof of travel arrangements (flight itinerary or hotel booking)
5. Proof of sufficient funds (bank statement or cash)
6. Health insurance that covers Azerbaijan
7. Invitation letter (for business or student visas)
8. Proof of enrollment (for student visas)

[SECTION] Entry Points & Procedures [/SECTION]
The main airports in Azerbaijan are Heydar Aliyev International Airport in Baku and Ganja International Airport. Land borders are also open, with major crossings at the borders with Georgia, Russia, and Iran. When arriving in Azerbaijan, visitors should be prepared to present their passport, visa (if required), and other documents to immigration officials. The process is typically straightforward, but visitors should be patient and respectful, as immigration officials may ask questions about their travel plans and purpose of visit.

Azerbaijan has introduced an automated border control system, which allows eligible citizens to use self-service kiosks to complete their immigration formalities. This has reduced waiting times and made the process more efficient. However, visitors should still be prepared to present their documents and answer questions from immigration officials if required.

[SECTION] Common Mistakes To Avoid [/SECTION]

- Not applying for an eVisa or visa on arrival in advance
- Not having sufficient funds or health insurance
- Not bringing a recent passport-sized photo
- Not having a clear itinerary or travel plans
