[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Azerbaijan has a mixed healthcare system, comprising both public and private institutions. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to the private sector, with limited resources and outdated equipment. Locals often rely on the public system, while foreigners and those who can afford it tend to opt for private healthcare. The system is not universal, and patients often need to pay out-of-pocket for services, making health insurance a recommended option for those living in or visiting Azerbaijan. The government has been working to improve the healthcare system, but progress has been slow, and significant challenges remain.

The healthcare system in Azerbaijan is not very foreigner-friendly, with limited English spoken by medical staff, especially outside of Baku. However, some private hospitals and clinics cater specifically to foreigners and offer high-quality care with English-speaking staff. These institutions often have partnerships with international insurance providers, making it easier for foreigners to access care. For locals, the public system is often the only option, and they may face long wait times and limited access to specialized care. In recent years, the government has introduced some reforms aimed at improving the public healthcare system, including increasing funding and introducing new technologies.

[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]
In the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the emergency number, 103, or go to the nearest hospital. Ambulance services are available, but may not always be reliable, especially outside of Baku. For foreigners, it is often best to go to a private hospital, as they tend to have better equipment and more experienced staff. Some of the best hospitals for foreigners in Baku include the Central Hospital and the Mediclub Hospital, which offer high-quality care and have English-speaking staff. It is also recommended to have health insurance that covers emergency care, as costs can quickly add up. In the event of a serious emergency, evacuation to a neighboring country or Europe may be necessary, highlighting the importance of having adequate health insurance coverage.
