  "content": "The official language of Azerbaijan is Azerbaijani, a Turkic language that is widely spoken throughout the country, with English proficiency being relatively low, making it essential for visitors to learn basic phrases and understand the local culture.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nOfficial Language(s): Azerbaijani\nWidely Spoken: Russian, English\nEnglish Proficiency: Low\nScript: Latin\nLanguage Family: Turkic\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]\nAzerbaijan has a diverse linguistic landscape, with Azerbaijani being the dominant language spoken by the majority of the population. There are several regional dialects, including the Baku dialect, which is considered the standard form of the language. Minority languages, such as Lezgian and Avar, are also spoken in certain regions. English is not widely understood, particularly outside of the capital city Baku, where it is more commonly spoken among the younger population and those in the tourism industry. However, many Azerbaijanis speak Russian as a second language, which can be useful for visitors who are familiar with the language. The use of English is becoming more prevalent, especially in business and tourism, but it is still not as common as in other European countries.\n\nThe linguistic diversity of Azerbaijan is also reflected in the country's history and cultural heritage. The language has been influenced by various cultures, including Persian, Arabic, and Turkish, which has resulted in a unique blend of languages and dialects. Visitors to Azerbaijan can experience this linguistic diversity firsthand by visiting different regions and interacting with the local population. Overall, while Azerbaijani is the dominant language, the country's linguistic landscape is complex and multifaceted, reflecting its strategic location at the crossroads of Europe and Asia.\n\nAzerbaijan's language policy has also undergone significant changes in recent years, with a shift from the Cyrillic script to the Latin script. This change has been aimed at promoting the use of the Azerbaijani language and reducing the influence of Russian. As a result, visitors to Azerbaijan may notice that many signs and documents are now written in the Latin script, which can make it easier for English-speaking visitors to navigate the country.\n\n[SECTION] Essential Phrases [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| English | Local Language | Pronunciation | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hello | Salam | SA-lam | formal |\n| Hello | Merhaba | mer-HAH-bah | informal |\n| Thank you | Təşəkkür | teh-sheh-KYUR | formal |\n| Please | Xahiş | KHA-heesh | formal |\n| Yes / No | Bəli / Yox | BEL-ee / YOH | formal |\n| Excuse me | Uzr istəyirəm | OZ-r ee-STEH-yeh-rehm | formal |\n| How much? | Neçə | NEH-cheh | formal |\n| Where is...? | Haradadir... | hah-RAH-dah-deer | formal |\n| I don't understand | Anlamaıram | ahn-lah-MAH-yrahm | formal |\n| Do you speak English? | İngiliscə danışırsiniz? | eeng-ee-LEES-cheh dah-nee-SHEER-siz | formal |\n| Help! | Kömək | KOH-mek | formal |\n| Goodbye | Sağ olun | SAH-oh-loon | formal |\n| Sorry | Bağışlayın | bah-HEE-shlah-yin | formal |\n| How are you? | Necəsən? | NEH-jeh-sehn | formal |\n| What's your name? | Adınız nədir? | ah-DEE-niz neh-DEER | formal |\n| I'm lost | Mən azdırıram | mehn ahz-DEE-rah-m | formal |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Numbers & Bargaining [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Number | Local Word | Pronunciation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Bir | BEER |\n| 2 | İki | EE-kee |\n| 3 | Üç | OOCH |\n| 4 | Dörd | DEHRD |\n| 5 | Beş | BESH |\n| 6 | Altı | AHL-tee |\n| 7 | Yeddi | YEH-dee |\n| 8 | Səkkiz | SEH-keez |\n| 9 | Doqquz | doh-GOOZ |\n| 10 | On | OHN |\n| 100 | Yüz | YOOZ |\n| 1000 | Min | MEEN |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Communication Tips [/SECTION]\n- When interacting with locals, it's essential to use formal language and titles, such as \"Mr.\" or \"Mrs.,\" to show respect.\n- Body language is also important, with direct eye contact and a firm handshake being considered polite.\n- Avoid using gestures with the left hand, as this is considered impolite in Azerbaijani culture.\n- When bargaining, it's essential to be patient and respectful, with a smile and a sense of humor going a long way.\n- Learn a few basic phrases in Azerbaijani, such as \"hello\" and \"thank you,\" to show respect for the local culture.\n- Don't be afraid to ask for help, with many Azerbaijanis being eager to assist visitors.\n- Be mindful of cultural differences, with Azerbaijan being a predominantly Muslim country.\n- When communicating with older Azerbaijanis, it's essential to show respect and deference, with formal language and titles being used.\n\n[SECTION] Translation Tools & Resources [/SECTION]\n- Download a translation app, such as Google Translate, to help with communication.\n- Carry a phrasebook or dictionary to help with basic phrases and vocabulary.\n- Take a language course or hire a guide to help with navigation and communication.\n- Use online resources, such as language learning websites or YouTube channels, to learn basic phrases and improve language skills.\n- Don't rely solely on English, with many Azerbaijanis speaking limited English, especially outside of Baku.",
