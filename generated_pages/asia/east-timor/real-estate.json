The market is largely driven by demand from international organizations, government agencies, and local businesses. Prices have been increasing steadily over the past few years, especially in urban areas, due to limited supply and growing demand. However, the market is not without its challenges, including a lack of infrastructure, limited financing options, and bureaucratic hurdles. The urban areas, such as Dili, tend to have higher prices and more modern amenities, while rural areas are generally more affordable but lack basic services.\n\nThe current market conditions in East Timor are characterized by a shortage of high-quality properties, particularly in the rental sector. This has led to a surge in prices, making it challenging for locals and foreigners alike to find affordable housing. The government has implemented various initiatives to stimulate the economy and attract foreign investment, which is expected to have a positive impact on the property market. Despite the challenges, East Timor's property market offers opportunities for investors and buyers who are willing to navigate the complexities of the local market.\n\nThe price trajectory in East Timor is expected to continue its upward trend, driven by increasing demand and limited supply. However, the market is not without its risks, and buyers should be cautious of the potential for market fluctuations. It is essential to conduct thorough research and seek local guidance before making any investment decisions. The government's efforts to improve infrastructure and attract foreign investment are expected to have a positive impact on the market, making it an attractive destination for investors and buyers.\n\n[SECTION] Prices by Area [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area/City | Buy (per sqm, USD) | Rent (monthly, USD) | Type |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Dili | 1,500 | 800 | Apartment |\n| Baucau | 1,000 | 500 | House |\n| Ermera | 800 | 400 | Land |\n| Liquica | 600 | 300 | Commercial |\n| Manatuto | 500 | 250 | Residential |\n| Aileu | 400 | 200 | Rural |\n| Ainaro | 350 | 150 | Agricultural |\n| Viqueque | 300 | 100 | Coastal |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Ownership Rules [/SECTION]\n- Foreigners can buy property in East Timor, but they must obtain a **foreign investment license** from the relevant authorities.\n- The license is typically granted for a period of 50 years, after which it can be renewed.\n- Foreigners can also lease property for a period of up to 50 years, with the option to renew.\n- To purchase property, foreigners must form a **local company**, which can be a challenging and time-consuming process.\n- Foreigners are required to obtain a **permit from the Ministry of Justice**, which can take several months to process.\n\n[SECTION] Buying Process [/SECTION]\n1.
