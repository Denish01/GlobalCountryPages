  "content": "East Timor's economy is a developing, lower-middle-income economy driven by agriculture, mining, and services, with a growing focus on diversification and infrastructure development to reduce dependence on oil revenues. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nGDP (nominal): ($1.4 billion estimate)\nGDP Per Capita: ($1,170 estimate)\nIncome Classification: (Lower-Middle)\nMain Industries: (agriculture, mining, services)\nCurrency: USD\nUnemployment Rate: (approximate 40%)\nEase of Doing Business: (ranked 175 out of 190 economies)\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]\nEast Timor's economy has experienced significant growth since gaining independence in 2002, driven primarily by oil and gas revenues. However, the country's economic classification as a lower-middle-income economy reflects its ongoing development challenges, including a largely subsistence-based agricultural sector and limited economic diversification. The economy's trajectory is expected to shift towards more sustainable, non-oil sectors, with a focus on developing the country's human capital, improving infrastructure, and promoting private sector growth.\n\nDespite the challenges, East Timor has made significant progress in recent years, with the government implementing policies aimed at promoting economic development, reducing poverty, and improving living standards. The country's strategic location in Southeast Asia, with proximity to major markets such as Indonesia and Australia, also presents opportunities for trade and investment. However, the economy remains vulnerable to external shocks, including fluctuations in global oil prices and climate-related disruptions to agricultural production.\n\nThe government's development priorities, as outlined in the National Strategic Development Plan, focus on promoting economic growth, reducing poverty, and improving living standards. Key priorities include investing in human capital, improving infrastructure, and promoting private sector development. The plan also emphasizes the need to diversify the economy, reduce dependence on oil revenues, and promote sustainable development.\n\n[SECTION] Key Industries [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Industry | Contribution | Details |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Agriculture | 25% of GDP | Subsistence farming, coffee, rice, and maize production |\n| Mining | 10% of GDP | Oil, gas, and mineral extraction, including copper and gold |\n| Services | 40% of GDP | Government services, trade, and tourism |\n| Manufacturing | 5% of GDP | Limited manufacturing sector, with focus on food processing and textiles |\n| Tourism | 2% of GDP | Growing tourism sector, with focus on eco-tourism and cultural heritage |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Trade Profile [/SECTION]\n**Top Exports:** \n- **Oil and gas**: East Timor's primary export, with revenues accounting for a significant proportion of GDP\n- **Coffee**: A major cash crop, with high-quality Arabica coffee beans exported to international markets\n- **Marble**: A significant mineral export, with deposits found in the country's mountainous regions\n- **Copper**: A growing mineral export, with several copper mines operating in the country\n- **Textiles**: A small but growing manufacturing sector, with textiles exported to regional markets\n**Top Imports:** \n- **Food and beverages**: A significant proportion of imports, reflecting the country's limited agricultural production\n- **Machinery and equipment**: Imports of machinery and equipment, primarily for the oil and gas sector\n- **Transport equipment**: Imports of vehicles and transport equipment, reflecting the country's limited manufacturing sector\n- **Electronics**: Imports of electronics, including computers and telecommunications equipment\n- **Pharmaceuticals**: Imports of pharmaceuticals, reflecting the country's limited healthcare sector\n**Key Trading Partners:** \n- Indonesia: A major trading partner, with significant trade in goods and services\n- China: A growing trading partner, with imports of machinery and equipment\n- Australia: A significant trading partner, with exports of oil and gas\n- Portugal: A historical trading partner, with trade in goods and services\n- Singapore: A major trading partner, with significant trade in goods and services\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n- Transport networks: Limited road networks, with a focus on upgrading and expanding roads to improve connectivity\n- Energy: Limited energy infrastructure, with a focus on developing renewable energy sources, including solar and wind power\n- Internet and mobile penetration: Growing internet and mobile penetration, with a focus on improving connectivity and access to digital services\n- Ports and airports: Limited port and airport facilities, with a focus on upgrading and expanding infrastructure to improve trade and tourism\n\n[SECTION] Economic Outlook [/SECTION]\nEast Timor's economic outlook is positive, with the government implementing policies aimed at promoting economic development, reducing poverty, and improving living standards.
