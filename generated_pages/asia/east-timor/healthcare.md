[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
East Timor's healthcare system is still in the process of development, with a mix of public and private providers. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, leading to limited access to quality care, especially in rural areas. The private sector, on the other hand, offers better quality care, but it is often expensive and out of reach for many locals. The **Ministry of Health** is responsible for overseeing the healthcare system, but it faces significant challenges, including a shortage of skilled healthcare professionals and limited resources. In urban areas, such as the capital Dili, there are more healthcare options available, including private clinics and hospitals, but in rural areas, access to healthcare is often limited to basic primary care.

The quality of care in East Timor is also a concern, with many healthcare facilities lacking basic equipment and supplies. Additionally, the country has a high rate of **tuberculosis** and **malaria**, which can be a challenge for the healthcare system. Despite these challenges, the government is working to improve the healthcare system, including increasing funding and training for healthcare professionals. However, more work needs to be done to address the significant health disparities and improve access to quality care for all.

The healthcare system in East Timor also faces challenges in terms of **health workforce**, with a significant shortage of skilled healthcare professionals, including doctors and nurses. This shortage is particularly pronounced in rural areas, where many healthcare facilities are understaffed and lack the necessary expertise to provide quality care. To address this challenge, the government is working to increase the number of healthcare professionals, including through training programs and recruitment of international healthcare workers.
