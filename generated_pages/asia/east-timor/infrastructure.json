  "content": "The infrastructure in East Timor is still developing, with significant investments in recent years aimed at improving the country's roads, power generation, and telecommunications, but challenges persist, particularly in rural areas. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 64% of population\nInternet Penetration: 27%\nRoad Network: 6,040 km, mostly unpaved and in poor condition\nRail Network: none\nMajor Airports: 2\nMajor Ports: 2\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nEast Timor's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other countries in the region, but the government has been actively working to improve the situation. Recent investments have focused on upgrading the road network, expanding electricity access, and enhancing telecommunications services. However, a significant gap remains between urban and rural areas, with the capital Dili and other major towns generally having better infrastructure than rural villages. The country's rugged terrain and limited resources also pose challenges to infrastructure development. Despite these challenges, East Timor has made progress in recent years, with the government aiming to increase access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation.\n\nThe government's development plans prioritize infrastructure development, recognizing its crucial role in supporting economic growth and improving living standards. International organizations and donor countries have also provided significant support to East Timor's infrastructure development efforts. As the country continues to grow and develop, it is likely that infrastructure will remain a key focus area for investment and development. With a growing population and increasing economic activity, the demand for reliable and efficient infrastructure services is likely to increase, driving further investment and development in the sector.\n\nEast Timor's infrastructure development is also closely tied to its economic development, with the government seeking to diversify the economy and reduce dependence on a few key sectors. Improving infrastructure can help to attract investment, boost trade, and support the growth of new industries, contributing to more sustainable and inclusive economic development. By investing in infrastructure, the government aims to create jobs, stimulate economic growth, and improve living standards for the population.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 6,040 km | Poor | Mostly unpaved and in need of maintenance |\n| Railways | 0 km | - | No rail network exists in East Timor |\n| Airports | 2 international, 5 domestic | Moderate | Limited facilities and services at some airports |\n| Ports | 2 major | Good | Well-equipped and efficient, but with limited capacity |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- The majority of **power generation** comes from diesel and heavy fuel oil-based power plants, with some **renewable energy** sources, such as solar and hydro power, being developed.\n- **Electricity access** is limited, with only 64% of the population having access to electricity, and frequent **power outages** are common, particularly in rural areas.\n- The government has set a goal to increase the share of **renewable energy** in the energy mix and to improve the reliability and efficiency of the **power grid**.\n- **Energy efficiency** measures are being promoted, with a focus on reducing energy consumption and promoting the use of energy-efficient appliances.\n- The **National Electricity Sector Strategic Plan** outlines the government's vision for the development of the electricity sector, including plans to increase access to electricity and improve the reliability of the power supply.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water safety** is a concern, with many households relying on **rainwater collection** or **wells** for their water needs.\n- **Sanitation coverage** is limited, with only about 40% of the population having access to improved sanitation facilities.\n- **Water access** in rural areas is a significant challenge, with many communities relying on **traditional water sources**, such as rivers and springs.\n- The government has launched initiatives to improve **water supply** and **sanitation services**, including the development of new water treatment plants and the expansion of piped water networks.\n- **Community-based** approaches to water and sanitation are being promoted, with a focus on empowering local communities to manage their own water and sanitation services.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is relatively widespread, with most of the population having access to mobile phone services.\n- **Fiber-optic** and **broadband** services are being rolled out, with a focus on improving **internet access** and **speed**.\n- The **4G network** is being expanded, with several operators offering 4G services in major towns and cities.\n- **Postal services** are limited, with mail delivery services available in major towns and cities, but not in rural areas.\n- The government has launched initiatives to improve **telecommunications infrastructure**, including the development of new fiber-optic cables and the expansion of mobile phone services.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The **Dili to Baucau Highway** project aims to upgrade the main road connecting the capital Dili to the town of Baucau, improving transportation links and reducing travel times.\n- The **East Timor National Roads Improvement Project** aims to upgrade and maintain the country's road network, with a focus on improving safety and reducing congestion.\n- The **Timor-Leste Electricity Sector Development Project** aims to improve the reliability and efficiency of the power grid, with a focus on increasing access to electricity and promoting renewable energy.\n- The **Water Supply and Sanitation Project** aims to improve access to safe water and sanitation services, with a focus on rural areas and disadvantaged communities.\n- The **Telecommunications Sector Development Project** aims to improve telecommunications infrastructure, with a focus on expanding mobile phone services, improving internet access, and promoting the use of information and communication technologies.",
