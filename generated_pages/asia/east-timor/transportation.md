[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
The main international airport in East Timor is Presidente Nicolau Lobato International Airport, located in the capital city of Dili. The airport receives flights from major hubs in Asia and Australia, including Singapore, Bali, and Darwin. Direct flights are available from these cities, but connections may be required for travelers from other parts of the world. Overland entry points are also available from Indonesia, with border crossings at Wini and Motamasin.

Travelers can enter East Timor by land from Indonesia, but the process can be time-consuming and requires careful planning. The border crossings are generally open during daylight hours, and visitors will need to present their passport and visa (if required) to immigration officials. It is also possible to take a ferry from Indonesia to East Timor, but this option is less common and may not be as convenient as flying or driving.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
East Timor has a limited domestic air network, with flights available between Dili and a few other major towns. The main domestic airline is **Timor Air**, which operates flights to destinations such as Baucau and Suai. Booking in advance is recommended, as flights can be irregular and may be cancelled due to weather or other conditions. Approximate costs for domestic flights range from $50 to $200, depending on the route and time of year.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
East Timor does not have a rail network, so trains are not an option for getting around the country. The lack of a rail system is due to the country's mountainous terrain and limited infrastructure, which makes it difficult to build and maintain railways. As a result, travelers will need to rely on other modes of transportation, such as buses, taxis, and rental cars.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Intercity bus companies in East Timor offer a convenient and affordable way to get around the country. The main bus company is **Timor Express**, which operates routes between Dili and other major towns. The buses are generally in good condition, but the roads can be rough, and journeys may be slow. Costs for bus travel range from $5 to $20, depending on the route and time of year.
