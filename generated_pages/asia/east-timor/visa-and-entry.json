Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of East Timor before traveling. [/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nEast Timor has a moderate visa policy, allowing citizens of certain countries to enter visa-free or obtain a visa on arrival. Currently, citizens of around 40 countries can enter East Timor without a visa, including Portugal, Brazil, and some European nations. The country is working to improve its tourism infrastructure and attract more visitors, which may lead to changes in its visa policy in the future. The visa policy is designed to balance the need to attract tourists and business travelers with the need to maintain national security and control over immigration.\n\nThe visa policy of East Timor is also influenced by its historical and cultural ties with other countries, particularly Portugal and Indonesia. The country's visa-free access policy is mainly limited to countries with which it has strong diplomatic and economic ties. Citizens of countries that are not eligible for visa-free access or visa on arrival will need to apply for a visa at an East Timorese embassy or consulate before traveling to the country.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | No | Visa on Arrival | 30 days | Can be extended for an additional 30 days |\n| UK Citizens | No | Visa on Arrival | 30 days | Can be extended for an additional 30 days |\n| EU Citizens | No | Visa-Free | 90 days | Must have a valid passport |\n| Canadian Citizens | No | Visa on Arrival | 30 days | Can be extended for an additional 30 days |\n| Australian Citizens | No | Visa on Arrival | 30 days | Can be extended for an additional 30 days |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | Tourist Visa | 30 days | Must apply in advance |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Tourist Visa | 30 days | Must apply in advance |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can obtain a visa on arrival at the airport or border crossing, which is valid for 30 days and can be extended for an additional 30 days.
