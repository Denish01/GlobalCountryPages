[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]
The linguistic landscape of East Timor is diverse, with over 30 languages spoken across the country. Tetum, also known as Tetun, is the most widely spoken language and is used as a lingua franca among the population. Portuguese, which was introduced during the colonial period, is also an official language and is used in government, education, and formal situations. Indonesian, which was the language of the former occupier, is also widely spoken, particularly among the older population. English is becoming increasingly popular, particularly among the younger population and those in the tourism industry, but overall English proficiency is still relatively low.

Regional dialects of Tetum are spoken in different parts of the country, with the dialect spoken in the capital Dili being the most widely understood. Minority languages, such as Bunak and Makasae, are also spoken in certain regions. Despite the linguistic diversity, Tetum is the language that is most widely used in everyday life, and is the language that visitors are most likely to encounter.

The use of English is becoming more widespread, particularly in the tourism industry, but it is still not as widely spoken as in other countries in the region. Visitors who speak English may be able to communicate with hotel staff, restaurant workers, and tour guides, but may still encounter difficulties when communicating with locals outside of these industries.

- Be patient and don't get frustrated if you encounter difficulties when communicating, as this can be seen as impolite.
