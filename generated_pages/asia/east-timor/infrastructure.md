# East Timor Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

The infrastructure in East Timor is still developing, with significant investments in recent years aimed at improving the country's roads, power generation, and telecommunications, but challenges persist, particularly in rural areas. 

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 64% of population
Internet Penetration: 27%
Road Network: 6,040 km, mostly unpaved and in poor condition
Rail Network: none
Major Airports: 2
Major Ports: 2
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
East Timor's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other countries in the region, but the government has been actively working to improve the situation. Recent investments have focused on upgrading the road network, expanding electricity access, and enhancing telecommunications services. However, a significant gap remains between urban and rural areas, with the capital Dili and other major towns generally having better infrastructure than rural villages. The country's rugged terrain and limited resources also pose challenges to infrastructure development. Despite these challenges, East Timor has made progress in recent years, with the government aiming to increase access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation.

The government's development plans prioritize infrastructure development, recognizing its crucial role in supporting economic growth and improving living standards. International organizations and donor countries have also provided significant support to East Timor's infrastructure development efforts. As the country continues to grow and develop, it is likely that infrastructure will remain a key focus area for investment and development. With a growing population and increasing economic activity, the demand for reliable and efficient infrastructure services is likely to increase, driving further investment and development in the sector.

East Timor's infrastructure development is also closely tied to its economic development, with the government seeking to diversify the economy and reduce dependence on a few key sectors. Improving infrastructure can help to attract investment, boost trade, and support the growth of new industries, contributing to more sustainable and inclusive economic development. By investing in infrastructure, the government aims to create jobs, stimulate economic growth, and improve living standards for the population.
