[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in East Timor is still in its early stages of development, with a significant urban-rural divide in terms of access and quality. In the capital city of Dili, internet speeds are generally faster and more reliable, with many cafes, restaurants, and hotels offering WiFi. However, in rural areas, internet access is often limited, with slow speeds and frequent outages. The reliability of the internet in East Timor can also be affected by the country's infrastructure, with frequent power outages and limited connectivity to the global internet backbone.

Despite these challenges, the East Timorese government has been working to improve the country's internet infrastructure, with plans to expand mobile network coverage and increase internet speeds. However, for now, visitors to East Timor should be prepared for limited internet access and slow speeds, especially outside of Dili. It's also worth noting that the cost of internet access in East Timor can be relatively high, especially for mobile data, which may be a factor to consider for visitors who need to stay connected.

[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]
To get a SIM card in East Timor, visitors can purchase one from a local mobile provider, such as Telekomcel or Timor Telecom. SIM cards are widely available at mobile phone shops, markets, and some supermarkets, and can be purchased for around 5 USD. To purchase a SIM card, visitors will need to provide their passport and may need to register their SIM card with the local authorities. It's recommended to purchase a SIM card from a reputable provider, as some smaller operators may have limited coverage and reliability.

Once you have purchased a SIM card, you can top up your credit at mobile phone shops, markets, or online. Data plans are available from most providers, with prices starting from around 1 USD per day for limited data. It's worth noting that data speeds can be slow, especially outside of Dili, so it's a good idea to check the coverage and speeds of your provider before purchasing a SIM card.
