The most common mode of transportation is by **minibus** or **shared taxi**, which can be found in most cities and towns. These vehicles operate on fixed routes and can be hailed on the street or at designated bus stops. The quality of public transit varies greatly between cities, with the capital city Dili having the most comprehensive network. Most people in East Timor get around by using these shared vehicles or by walking or cycling for shorter distances.\n\nIn addition to shared vehicles, **motorcycles** and **scooters** are also a popular mode of transportation, especially in rural areas where roads can be rough and public transportation may not be available. The government has been investing in improving the country's road network, but many roads remain in poor condition, making travel times longer than expected. Despite these challenges, the scenic beauty of East Timor makes traveling by road a rewarding experience, with stunning views of the coastline and mountains.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.50 | $20 | Limited coverage, mostly in Dili |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $1-2 | N/A | Fixed routes, available in most cities |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $1.50 | $0.50 | $5-10 | Available in Dili |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $1 | $0.30 | $3-6 | Grab, Gojek available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $10-20 | To city center, by taxi or private car |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.10 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-60 | Economy car, including insurance |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-2 | Limited parking options available |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $2-5 | Limited toll roads, mostly on highways |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-20 | Limited schedules, mostly on main roads |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-200 | Limited routes, mostly from Dili |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider using shared vehicles or walking or cycling for shorter distances.\n- Use ride-hailing apps like Grab or Gojek to get around cities, as they are often cheaper than metered taxis.\n- Always negotiate the fare before getting into a taxi or shared vehicle, as prices can vary depending on the driver.\n- Be aware of your surroundings and keep an eye on your belongings, especially in crowded areas or on public transportation.\n- Consider renting a car or hiring a private driver for longer trips or to explore rural areas, as public transportation options may be limited.\n- Download maps or transportation apps to help navigate the country's road network and find the best routes.",
