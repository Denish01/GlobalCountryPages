[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in East Timor is a mixed system, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public healthcare system is generally more affordable, with lower costs for consultations, treatments, and medications. However, public facilities are often overcrowded and understaffed, which can lead to long waiting times and a lower quality of care. Private facilities, on the other hand, offer better quality care and more specialized services, but at a significantly higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only option, while foreigners and expats may prefer to use private facilities.

For foreigners and expats, it is recommended to have health insurance that covers them in East Timor, as the public healthcare system may not provide the same level of care as what they are used to in their home country. Many private health insurance providers offer plans that cover medical expenses in East Timor, and some even offer evacuation services to nearby countries with better medical facilities. It is also important to note that some medical procedures and treatments may not be available in East Timor, and patients may need to be evacuated to another country for proper care.
