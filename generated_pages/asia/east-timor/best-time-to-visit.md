[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
East Timor has a tropical **savanna climate**, with two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from May to October, is characterized by dry and sunny weather, with average temperatures ranging from 20 to 30 degrees Celsius. The wet season, which runs from November to April, is marked by heavy rainfall and high humidity, with average temperatures ranging from 22 to 32 degrees Celsius. The seasons can affect travel plans, as some roads may become impassable during the wet season, and outdoor activities such as hiking and diving may be limited.

The dry season is the best time to visit East Timor, as the weather is generally pleasant and ideal for outdoor activities such as **hiking**, **diving**, and **snorkeling**. The wet season, on the other hand, can be challenging for travelers, as some areas may experience **flooding** and **landslides**, and the high humidity can make it uncomfortable to explore the outdoors.

The climate in East Timor also varies by region, with the coastal areas tend to be hotter and more humid than the mountainous regions. The **mountainous regions**, such as the central highlands, can be cooler and more pleasant, especially during the dry season.
