However, the government has been investing in improving the infrastructure, and the quality of services is gradually increasing. The costs of utilities in East Timor can be stable, but they may fluctuate depending on the season. For example, during the dry season, water costs may increase due to scarcity, while electricity costs may rise during the hot summer months due to higher demand for air conditioning.\n\nThe overall cost of living in East Timor is relatively low, but the cost of utilities can still be a significant expense for many households.
