  "content": "Healthcare costs in East Timor vary significantly between public and private facilities, with the public healthcare system being generally more affordable but often overcrowded and understaffed, while private facilities offer better quality care at a higher cost.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $144 (2023)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 7.0% (2023)\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 112\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: USD\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe healthcare system in East Timor is a mixed system, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public healthcare system is generally more affordable, with lower costs for consultations, treatments, and medications. However, public facilities are often overcrowded and understaffed, which can lead to long waiting times and a lower quality of care. Private facilities, on the other hand, offer better quality care and more specialized services, but at a significantly higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only option, while foreigners and expats may prefer to use private facilities.\n\nFor foreigners and expats, it is recommended to have health insurance that covers them in East Timor, as the public healthcare system may not provide the same level of care as what they are used to in their home country. Many private health insurance providers offer plans that cover medical expenses in East Timor, and some even offer evacuation services to nearby countries with better medical facilities. It is also important to note that some medical procedures and treatments may not be available in East Timor, and patients may need to be evacuated to another country for proper care.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $5-$10 | $20-$50 | |\n| Specialist Consultation | $10-$20 | $50-$100 | |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-$20 | $30-$70 | |\n| Eye Exam | $5-$10 | $20-$50 | |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $30-$50 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $20-$50 | |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $50-$100 | |\n| Basic Surgery | $200-$500 | |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $500-$1,000 | |\n| MRI Scan | $100-$300 | |\n| X-Ray | $20-$50 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Covers basic medical expenses, including doctor visits and hospital stays |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-$300 | Covers a wide range of medical expenses, including specialist consultations and surgeries |\n| International / Expat | $200-$500 | Covers medical expenses in East Timor and evacuation to nearby countries if necessary |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Common medications such as **antibiotics** and **painkillers** are widely available at pharmacies and cost between $5-$10 per prescription.\n- **Prescription medications** are available at pharmacies, but may require a doctor's prescription.\n- Pharmacy availability is generally good in urban areas, but may be limited in rural areas.\n- Over-the-counter medications are widely available at pharmacies and supermarkets.\n- The cost of medications can vary significantly depending on the brand and type, with **generic medications** often being cheaper than **brand-name medications**.\n- Some medications may not be available in East Timor, and patients may need to import them from other countries.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is best to call the emergency number 112 or go to the nearest hospital. The **Guido Valadares National Hospital** in Dili is one of the best public hospitals in the country, and offers a range of emergency services. Private hospitals such as the **Dili National Hospital** and the **East Timor Medical Center** also offer emergency services, but may be more expensive. Ambulance services are available, but may be limited in rural areas. It is also important to note that medical facilities and equipment may be limited in East Timor, and patients may need to be evacuated to another country for proper care.\n\nFor foreigners and expats, it is recommended to have a plan in place in case of a medical emergency, including having a list of emergency contact numbers and knowing the location of the nearest hospital. It is also a good idea to have health insurance that covers emergency medical expenses, including evacuation to another country if necessary.
