The cost of living in East Timor is driven up by the high cost of transportation, with many goods being shipped in from other countries. As a result, eating out at restaurants can be expensive, with meals at mid-range restaurants costing around $10-$15 USD per person. However, home cooking is a common practice in East Timor, and with a little planning, it is possible to eat well on a budget. The eating-out culture in East Timor is not as prevalent as in other countries, with many locals preferring to cook at home using fresh ingredients from the market.\n\nThe prices of food in East Timor can fluctuate depending on the season, with fresh produce being more expensive during the dry season. The country's economy is also heavily influenced by the oil and gas industry, which can impact the prices of goods and services. Despite these challenges, East Timor has a rich culinary tradition, with a focus on fresh seafood, meat, and vegetables. The local cuisine is a unique blend of Portuguese, Indonesian, and traditional Timorese flavors, with popular dishes including **bacalhau** (dried cod), **calulu** (stew), and **ibarra** (grilled meat).\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $2.50 | $2.50 USD | imported from Australia |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $1.50 | $1.50 USD | locally baked |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $2.00 | $2.00 USD | locally produced |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $1.20 | $1.20 USD | imported from Indonesia |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $6.00 | $6.00 USD | imported from Brazil |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $10.00 | $10.00 USD | imported from Australia |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $5.00 | $5.00 USD | imported from China |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $2.00 | $2.00 USD | locally produced |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $1.50 | $1.50 USD | locally produced |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $1.20 | $1.20 USD | locally produced |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $8.00 | $8.00 USD | made from buffalo milk |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $1.00 | $1.00 USD | locally bottled |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $3-$5 | typical dishes like **balada** (grilled meat) and **espresso** |\n| Casual Restaurant | $10-$15 | one person, including a main course and drink |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $20-$30 | 3 courses, including appetizer, main course, and dessert |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $50-$70 | upscale, including wine and service |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $2-$3 | **Polar** and **Bintang** are popular local beers |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $5-$7 | **Heineken** and **Carlsberg** are popular imported beers |\n| Cappuccino | $2-$3 | including coffee and pastry |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $1-$2 | **Coca-Cola** and **Pepsi** are widely available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nThe prices of goods at supermarkets and local markets in East Timor can vary significantly, with supermarkets generally being more expensive. However, supermarkets often have a wider range of products, including imported goods, and can be more convenient for shoppers. Local markets, on the other hand, offer fresh produce and traditional products at lower prices, but the quality and availability of goods can vary. It is generally recommended to buy fresh produce and traditional products at local markets, while supermarkets are better for imported goods and convenience items. Bargaining is not common in East Timor, but it is possible to negotiate prices at local markets, especially when buying in bulk.\n\nThe price difference between supermarkets and local markets can be significant, with some items costing up to 50% more at supermarkets. For example, a kilogram of **rice** can cost around $1.20 USD at a local market, while the same item can cost around $2.00 USD at a supermarket. However, supermarkets often have a wider range of products, including organic and specialty items, which can be worth the extra cost for some shoppers. Ultimately, the choice between supermarkets and local markets depends on the individual shopper's needs and preferences.\n\n[SECTION] Local Food Tips [/SECTION]\n- Eat at local eateries and street food stalls, which offer affordable and delicious meals\n- Buy fresh produce and traditional products at local markets, where prices are generally lower\n- Try local staples like **bacalhau** and **calulu**, which are flavorful and nutritious\n- Avoid buying imported goods, which can be expensive and may not be as fresh as local products\n- Consider buying in bulk, which can be cheaper and more convenient for items like **rice** and **pasta**\n- Learn some basic **Tetum** phrases, which can help you navigate local markets and communicate with vendors",
