[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in East Timor is still developing, with a strong emphasis on public education. However, the quality of public education can be inconsistent, with a lack of resources and infrastructure in some areas. Private schools, on the other hand, tend to offer higher-quality education, but are often expensive and inaccessible to many locals. The language of instruction in East Timor is primarily Tetum and Portuguese, although some schools may also teach in Indonesian or English. Compulsory education in East Timor lasts for 9 years, from primary to junior secondary school. International schools are available in the capital city of Dili, catering to expatriate families and offering a range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate and the Australian curriculum.

Despite the challenges facing the education system, the government of East Timor has made significant efforts to improve access to education, particularly in rural areas. The country has also seen an increase in the number of private schools and international institutions, offering a range of educational options for students. However, the quality of education can still vary significantly depending on the institution and location, with some schools struggling with limited resources and inadequate infrastructure. As a result, many families opt for private education, which can be expensive but often provides better facilities and teaching standards.
