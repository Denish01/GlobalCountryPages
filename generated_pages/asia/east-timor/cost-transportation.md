[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
East Timor's transportation network is still developing, with limited public transportation options available. The most common mode of transportation is by **minibus** or **shared taxi**, which can be found in most cities and towns. These vehicles operate on fixed routes and can be hailed on the street or at designated bus stops. The quality of public transit varies greatly between cities, with the capital city Dili having the most comprehensive network. Most people in East Timor get around by using these shared vehicles or by walking or cycling for shorter distances.

In addition to shared vehicles, **motorcycles** and **scooters** are also a popular mode of transportation, especially in rural areas where roads can be rough and public transportation may not be available. The government has been investing in improving the country's road network, but many roads remain in poor condition, making travel times longer than expected. Despite these challenges, the scenic beauty of East Timor makes traveling by road a rewarding experience, with stunning views of the coastline and mountains.
