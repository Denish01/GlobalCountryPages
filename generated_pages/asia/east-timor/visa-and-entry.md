# East Timor Visa & Entry Requirements

You will need to obtain a visa to enter East Timor, unless you are a citizen of one of the countries that are eligible for visa-free access or can obtain a visa on arrival.

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of East Timor before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
East Timor has a moderate visa policy, allowing citizens of certain countries to enter visa-free or obtain a visa on arrival. Currently, citizens of around 40 countries can enter East Timor without a visa, including Portugal, Brazil, and some European nations. The country is working to improve its tourism infrastructure and attract more visitors, which may lead to changes in its visa policy in the future. The visa policy is designed to balance the need to attract tourists and business travelers with the need to maintain national security and control over immigration.

The visa policy of East Timor is also influenced by its historical and cultural ties with other countries, particularly Portugal and Indonesia. The country's visa-free access policy is mainly limited to countries with which it has strong diplomatic and economic ties. Citizens of countries that are not eligible for visa-free access or visa on arrival will need to apply for a visa at an East Timorese embassy or consulate before traveling to the country.

Tourists can also apply for a visa in advance at an East Timorese embassy or consulate.

The requirements for business travelers are more stringent than those for tourists, and they must provide documentation of their business activities and plans.
