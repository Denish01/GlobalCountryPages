[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in East Timor is structured into primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. Primary education, also known as **Ensino Básico**, is compulsory for 9 years and is divided into two cycles. The first cycle lasts for 5 years, and the second cycle lasts for 4 years. Secondary education, or **Ensino Secundário**, is not compulsory and typically lasts for 3 years. Tertiary education is offered at universities and institutes, with the **National University of East Timor** being the largest and most prominent institution. The quality of education in East Timor is a concern, with many schools lacking basic infrastructure and resources. Public schools are generally overcrowded and underfunded, while private schools are often expensive and exclusive.

The education system in East Timor faces many challenges, including a shortage of qualified teachers, inadequate infrastructure, and limited resources. However, the government has made efforts to improve the education system, including increasing funding for education and implementing new curriculum and teaching methods. Despite these challenges, education is highly valued in East Timorese culture, and many students and families are eager to learn and improve their socio-economic status.

The government of East Timor has also made efforts to increase access to education, particularly for disadvantaged groups such as girls and children from rural areas. Programs such as **scholarships** and **school feeding programs** have been implemented to encourage students to attend school and stay in school. However, more needs to be done to address the systemic challenges facing the education system in East Timor.
