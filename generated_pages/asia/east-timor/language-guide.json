  "content": "The official languages of East Timor are Portuguese and Tetum, with Tetum being the most widely spoken language among the local population.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nOfficial Language(s): Portuguese, Tetum\nWidely Spoken: Indonesian, English\nEnglish Proficiency: Low\nScript: Latin\nLanguage Family: Austronesian, Romance\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]\nThe linguistic landscape of East Timor is diverse, with over 30 languages spoken across the country. Tetum, also known as Tetun, is the most widely spoken language and is used as a lingua franca among the population. Portuguese, which was introduced during the colonial period, is also an official language and is used in government, education, and formal situations. Indonesian, which was the language of the former occupier, is also widely spoken, particularly among the older population. English is becoming increasingly popular, particularly among the younger population and those in the tourism industry, but overall English proficiency is still relatively low.\n\nRegional dialects of Tetum are spoken in different parts of the country, with the dialect spoken in the capital Dili being the most widely understood. Minority languages, such as Bunak and Makasae, are also spoken in certain regions. Despite the linguistic diversity, Tetum is the language that is most widely used in everyday life, and is the language that visitors are most likely to encounter.\n\nThe use of English is becoming more widespread, particularly in the tourism industry, but it is still not as widely spoken as in other countries in the region. Visitors who speak English may be able to communicate with hotel staff, restaurant workers, and tour guides, but may still encounter difficulties when communicating with locals outside of these industries.\n\n[SECTION] Essential Phrases [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| English | Local Language | Pronunciation | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hello | Bondia | bon-dee-ah | formal |\n| Hello | Loos | loh-ohs | informal |\n| Thank you | Obrigado/Obrigada | oh-bree-gah-doo/oh-bree-gah-dah | formal |\n| Thank you | Ha'u han | hah-oo hahn | informal |\n| Please | Por favor | pohr fah-vor | formal |\n| Please | Tansa | tahhn-sah | informal |\n| Yes / No | Sim/Nao | seem/noh | formal |\n| Yes / No | Iha/La | ee-ah/lah | informal |\n| Excuse me | Desculpe | deh-skool-peh | formal |\n| Excuse me | Keta | keh-tah | informal |\n| How much? | Kila | kee-lah |  |\n| Where is...? | Iha ne'ebe | ee-ah neh-eh-beh |  |\n| I don't understand | La komprende | lah kohm-prehnd-eh | formal |\n| I don't understand | Ha'u la simi | hah-oo lah seem-ee | informal |\n| Do you speak English? | Ko'alia ingles | koh-ah-lee-ah eeng-lehs | formal |\n| Help! | Ajuda | ah-joo-dah |  |\n| Goodbye | Tchau | choo | informal |\n| Sorry | Pedida | peh-dee-dah | formal |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Numbers & Bargaining [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Number | Local Word | Pronunciation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Idus | ee-doos |\n| 2 | Ruas | roo-ahs |\n| 3 | Tolas | toh-lahs |\n| 4 | Ha'at | hah-aht |\n| 5 | Lima | lee-mah |\n| 6 | Neen | neh-ehn |\n| 7 | Hitu | hee-too |\n| 8 | Ualu | oo-ah-loo |\n| 9 | Sia | see-ah |\n| 10 | Sanulu | sah-noo-loo |\n| 100 | Atus | ah-toos |\n| 1000 | Ribu | ree-boo |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Communication Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be respectful of local customs and traditions, particularly when communicating with older people or in formal situations.\n- Use both hands when giving or receiving something, as using one hand can be considered impolite.\n- Avoid public displays of affection, as this can be considered taboo in East Timorese culture.\n- Use formal language when speaking to people you don't know, and avoid using slang or colloquialisms.\n- Be patient and don't get frustrated if you encounter difficulties when communicating, as this can be seen as impolite.\n- Learn a few basic phrases in Tetum, such as \"bondia\" (hello) and \"obrigado/obrigada\" (thank you), as this can go a long way in showing respect for the local culture.\n\n[SECTION] Translation Tools & Resources [/SECTION]\n- Download a translation app, such as Google Translate, to help with communication.\n- Carry a phrasebook or dictionary, particularly if you plan to travel to rural areas where English may not be widely spoken.\n- Take a language course or attend a language exchange event to learn more about the Tetum language and culture.\n- Use online resources, such as language learning websites and blogs, to learn more about the languages spoken in East Timor.\n- Consider hiring a local guide or interpreter, particularly if you plan to travel to areas where English is not widely spoken.",
