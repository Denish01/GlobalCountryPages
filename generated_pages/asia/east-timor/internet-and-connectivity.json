  "content": "The internet in East Timor is generally limited, with slow speeds and a lack of widespread coverage, but it is possible to get a SIM card or access WiFi in major towns and cities. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nAverage Internet Speed: 5 Mbps download\nMobile Network Coverage: Moderate\nMain Carriers: Telekomcel, Telkomcel, Timor Telecom\nSIM Card Cost: 5 USD for tourist SIM\nWiFi Availability: Limited\n5G Available: No\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]\nThe internet in East Timor is still in its early stages of development, with a significant urban-rural divide in terms of access and quality. In the capital city of Dili, internet speeds are generally faster and more reliable, with many cafes, restaurants, and hotels offering WiFi. However, in rural areas, internet access is often limited, with slow speeds and frequent outages. The reliability of the internet in East Timor can also be affected by the country's infrastructure, with frequent power outages and limited connectivity to the global internet backbone.\n\nDespite these challenges, the East Timorese government has been working to improve the country's internet infrastructure, with plans to expand mobile network coverage and increase internet speeds. However, for now, visitors to East Timor should be prepared for limited internet access and slow speeds, especially outside of Dili. It's also worth noting that the cost of internet access in East Timor can be relatively high, especially for mobile data, which may be a factor to consider for visitors who need to stay connected.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nTo get a SIM card in East Timor, visitors can purchase one from a local mobile provider, such as Telekomcel or Timor Telecom. SIM cards are widely available at mobile phone shops, markets, and some supermarkets, and can be purchased for around 5 USD. To purchase a SIM card, visitors will need to provide their passport and may need to register their SIM card with the local authorities. It's recommended to purchase a SIM card from a reputable provider, as some smaller operators may have limited coverage and reliability.\n\nOnce you have purchased a SIM card, you can top up your credit at mobile phone shops, markets, or online. Data plans are available from most providers, with prices starting from around 1 USD per day for limited data. It's worth noting that data speeds can be slow, especially outside of Dili, so it's a good idea to check the coverage and speeds of your provider before purchasing a SIM card.\n\n[TABLE]\n| Carrier | Tourist Plan | Data | Price (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Telekomcel | Tourist Plan | 1GB | 5 | Valid for 7 days |\n| Timor Telecom | Data Plan | 2GB | 10 | Valid for 30 days |\n| Telkomcel | Internet Plan | 500MB | 3 | Valid for 7 days |\n| Telemor | Tourist Plan | 1GB | 5 | Valid for 7 days |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] WiFi Availability [/SECTION]\n- Hotel WiFi quality is generally good, with most hotels in Dili offering free WiFi to guests\n- Cafe WiFi culture is growing in Dili, with many cafes and restaurants offering free WiFi to customers\n- Coworking spaces are limited in East Timor, but some are available in Dili, offering reliable WiFi and other amenities\n- Public WiFi is limited, but some public areas, such as airports and shopping centers, may offer free WiFi\n- Some restaurants and bars also offer free WiFi, especially in tourist areas\n\n[SECTION] For Remote Workers [/SECTION]\n- Coworking spaces, such as the Dili Coworking Space, offer reliable WiFi and other amenities, such as meeting rooms and printing services\n- Reliable cafe chains, such as the Castaway Bar and Restaurant, offer free WiFi and a comfortable working environment\n- Backup internet options, such as mobile hotspots, are available from some providers, but can be expensive\n- VPNs may be necessary to access some websites, especially those that are blocked by the local authorities\n- Some hotels and resorts also offer coworking spaces and other amenities for remote workers\n\n[SECTION] Tips & Warnings [/SECTION]\n- Internet censorship is limited in East Timor, but some websites may be blocked by the local authorities\n- Blocked sites may include those that are deemed to be against the country's laws or morals\n- VPNs are recommended to access some websites, especially those that are blocked by the local authorities\n- Roaming alternatives, such as purchasing a local SIM card, can be more cost-effective than using international roaming\n- eSIM options are not widely available in East Timor, but some providers may offer them to visitors\n- It's a good idea to check the coverage and speeds of your provider before purchasing a SIM card or data plan\n- Visitors should also be aware of the potential for internet outages and power cuts, especially in rural areas.",
