[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
East Timor's economy has experienced significant growth since gaining independence in 2002, driven primarily by oil and gas revenues. However, the country's economic classification as a lower-middle-income economy reflects its ongoing development challenges, including a largely subsistence-based agricultural sector and limited economic diversification. The economy's trajectory is expected to shift towards more sustainable, non-oil sectors, with a focus on developing the country's human capital, improving infrastructure, and promoting private sector growth.

Despite the challenges, East Timor has made significant progress in recent years, with the government implementing policies aimed at promoting economic development, reducing poverty, and improving living standards. The country's strategic location in Southeast Asia, with proximity to major markets such as Indonesia and Australia, also presents opportunities for trade and investment. However, the economy remains vulnerable to external shocks, including fluctuations in global oil prices and climate-related disruptions to agricultural production.

The government's development priorities, as outlined in the National Strategic Development Plan, focus on promoting economic growth, reducing poverty, and improving living standards. Key priorities include investing in human capital, improving infrastructure, and promoting private sector development. The plan also emphasizes the need to diversify the economy, reduce dependence on oil revenues, and promote sustainable development.
