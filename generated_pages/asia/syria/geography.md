[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Syria is situated in the heart of the Middle East, with its capital city Damascus being one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. It is bordered by Turkey to the north, Iraq to the east, Jordan to the south, Israel to the southwest, and Lebanon to the west. The country has a narrow coastline along the Mediterranean Sea to the west, which provides access to major shipping routes and has played a significant role in the country's history and economy.

The location of Syria at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa has made it an important center for trade and cultural exchange throughout history. The country's borders have been influenced by its strategic position, with various empires and powers competing for control over the region. Today, Syria's borders are a significant factor in its relations with neighboring countries, with ongoing tensions and conflicts affecting the region.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Syria's terrain is characterized by a mix of mountains, plateaus, and deserts, with the **Syrian Desert** covering a significant portion of the country. The **Anti-Lebanon Mountains** and the **Jabal al-Druze** range are two of the main mountain ranges in Syria, with the highest point being **Mount Hermon** on the border with Lebanon. The **Euphrates River** and the **Orontes River** are the two main rivers in Syria, providing water and fertile soil for agriculture.

The Syrian coastline along the Mediterranean Sea is relatively short, but it provides access to important ports such as **Latakia** and **Tartous**. The coastal region is also home to several important cities, including **Latakia** and **Banias**, which have a more **temperate** climate compared to the rest of the country. Inland, the terrain becomes increasingly arid, with the **Syrian Desert** covering much of the eastern part of the country.

The diversity of Syria's terrain and landscape has supported a wide range of flora and fauna, with several **nature reserves** and **protected areas** established to conserve the country's natural heritage. However, the ongoing conflict in Syria has had a significant impact on the country's environment, with many areas suffering from **deforestation**, **soil erosion**, and **pollution**.

In addition to its natural beauty, Syria's terrain has also played a significant role in shaping the country's history and culture. The **mountain ranges** have provided a natural barrier against invading armies, while the **rivers** have supported agriculture and trade. The **deserts** have also been an important part of Syrian culture, with many Bedouin tribes traditionally inhabiting these areas.
