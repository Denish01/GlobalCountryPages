[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Syria's economy is classified as a lower-middle-income economy, with a GDP per capita of around $1,244. The country has a mixed economy, with a significant role for state-owned enterprises, particularly in strategic sectors such as oil and gas, and telecommunications. However, the economy has been severely impacted by the ongoing civil war, which has resulted in significant damage to infrastructure, a decline in oil production, and a sharp decrease in foreign investment. The economy has also been subject to international sanctions, which have limited the country's access to foreign markets and finance.

The Syrian economy has historically been driven by the agricultural and oil sectors, with the country being a significant producer of cotton, wheat, and olive oil. However, the oil sector has been severely impacted by the civil war, with production declining significantly. The manufacturing sector has also been affected, with many factories forced to close due to a lack of raw materials and equipment. The services sector, including tourism, has also been severely impacted by the conflict.

The Syrian government has implemented a number of economic reforms in recent years, aimed at liberalizing the economy and encouraging private sector investment. However, the pace of reform has been slow, and the economy remains heavily dependent on state-owned enterprises. The government has also sought to promote economic development through investment in infrastructure, including the construction of new roads, bridges, and telecommunications networks.

[SECTION] Economic Outlook [/SECTION]

However, the government has announced a number of major development projects, including the construction of a new highway connecting Damascus to the port city of Latakia, and the development of a number of industrial zones. The government has also sought to promote economic development through investment in human capital, including education and healthcare.

The Syrian economy has the potential to recover and grow in the long term, driven by the country's strategic location, rich natural resources, and highly educated population. However, this will require significant investment in infrastructure, including the rebuilding of damaged roads, bridges, and buildings, as well as the development of new sectors such as tourism and technology. The government will also need to implement economic reforms, including the liberalization of the economy and the promotion of private sector investment, in order to create a favorable business environment and attract foreign investment.
