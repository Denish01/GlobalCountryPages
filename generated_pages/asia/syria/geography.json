It is bordered by Turkey to the north, Iraq to the east, Jordan to the south, Israel to the southwest, and Lebanon to the west. The country has a narrow coastline along the Mediterranean Sea to the west, which provides access to major shipping routes and has played a significant role in the country's history and economy.\n\nThe location of Syria at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa has made it an important center for trade and cultural exchange throughout history. The country's borders have been influenced by its strategic position, with various empires and powers competing for control over the region. Today, Syria's borders are a significant factor in its relations with neighboring countries, with ongoing tensions and conflicts affecting the region.\n\n[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]\nSyria's terrain is characterized by a mix of mountains, plateaus, and deserts, with the **Syrian Desert** covering a significant portion of the country. The **Anti-Lebanon Mountains** and the **Jabal al-Druze** range are two of the main mountain ranges in Syria, with the highest point being **Mount Hermon** on the border with Lebanon. The **Euphrates River** and the **Orontes River** are the two main rivers in Syria, providing water and fertile soil for agriculture.\n\nThe Syrian coastline along the Mediterranean Sea is relatively short, but it provides access to important ports such as **Latakia** and **Tartous**.
