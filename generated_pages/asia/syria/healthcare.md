[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The Syrian healthcare system is a mixed model, with both public and private providers playing a role. The public sector is responsible for providing primary healthcare services, while private hospitals and clinics offer more specialized care. However, the system has been severely strained due to the ongoing conflict, with many healthcare facilities damaged or destroyed, and a significant shortage of medical personnel and supplies. In urban areas, such as Damascus and Aleppo, access to healthcare is generally better, with more facilities and specialized care available. In contrast, rural areas often have limited access to healthcare services, with few facilities and a lack of specialized care.

The quality of care in Syria is also a concern, with many healthcare facilities lacking basic equipment and supplies. Additionally, the conflict has led to a significant brain drain, with many medical professionals leaving the country. Despite these challenges, there are efforts underway to rebuild and strengthen the healthcare system, including the establishment of new healthcare facilities and the training of medical personnel.

The Syrian government has also implemented initiatives to improve access to healthcare, particularly for vulnerable populations, such as refugees and internally displaced persons. However, more needs to be done to address the significant healthcare needs of the population, particularly in rural areas.
