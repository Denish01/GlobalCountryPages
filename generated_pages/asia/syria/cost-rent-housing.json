Typical lease terms in Syria range from 6-12 months, with a deposit requirement of 1-2 months' rent. Tenant rights are not well-established in Syria, and renters often have limited protection against eviction or rent increases. Compared to its regional neighbors, Syria's housing costs are relatively moderate, with countries like Lebanon and Jordan having higher rent prices, while Turkey and Iraq have more affordable options.\n\nThe Syrian housing market has been heavily impacted by the ongoing conflict, leading to a shortage of available properties and a significant increase in prices. However, in recent years, there has been a slight decrease in rent prices due to the economic downturn and the decline of the Syrian pound. Despite this, the housing market in Syria remains highly competitive, and renters often have to act quickly to secure a property. The government has implemented some measures to regulate the housing market and protect tenants, but more needs to be done to address the ongoing housing crisis.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $150-$300 | $80-$200 | basic amenities, 1-2 rooms |\n| 1 Bedroom | $200-$500 | $100-$300 | 1-2 bedrooms, 1 bathroom, moderate quality |\n| 2 Bedroom | $300-$700 | $150-$400 | 2-3 bedrooms, 1-2 bathrooms, spacious |\n| 3 Bedroom | $500-$1,200 | $250-$600 | 3-4 bedrooms, 2-3 bathrooms, large |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $1,500-$3,000 | prime locations, modern amenities |\n| Suburbs | $1,000-$2,000 | residential areas, moderate quality |\n| Rural | $500-$1,500 | basic amenities, limited services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Abu Rummaneh**: a upscale neighborhood in Damascus with rent prices ranging from $300-$700 USD per month, known for its modern amenities and safe environment.\n- **Malki**: a residential neighborhood in Damascus with rent prices ranging from $200-$500 USD per month, popular with expats and locals alike.\n- **Mezzeh**: a neighborhood in Damascus with rent prices ranging from $150-$350 USD per month, known for its lively atmosphere and access to amenities.\n- **Karam al-Zaytun**: a neighborhood in Damascus with rent prices ranging from $100-$300 USD per month, a popular area for students and young professionals.\n- **Shaalan**: a neighborhood in Damascus with rent prices ranging from $150-$400 USD per month, known for its historic architecture and vibrant nightlife.\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Syria [/SECTION]\n- Research the local market thoroughly to find the best deals on rent prices.\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent to avoid scams and ensure a smooth transaction.\n- Negotiate the rent price and terms of the lease before signing any agreement.\n- Be prepared to pay a deposit and first month's rent upfront.\n- Utilities such as electricity, water, and gas are usually not included in the rent price.\n- Furnished apartments are less common in Syria, so be prepared to purchase or rent furniture separately.\n- Consider renting a property through a local landlord or property management company to ensure a more secure and reliable transaction.",
