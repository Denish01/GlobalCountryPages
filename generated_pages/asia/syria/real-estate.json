Despite this, there are still opportunities for investment, particularly in areas that have been less affected by the conflict. The market is currently characterized by low demand and high supply, which has driven down prices and made it a buyer's market. However, the market is expected to recover in the long term, driven by government efforts to rebuild and restore damaged infrastructure.\n\nThe price trajectory of the Syrian property market has been volatile, with prices fluctuating significantly over the past few years. However, prices are currently at a low point, making it an attractive time to invest. The market can be broadly divided into urban and rural areas, with urban areas such as Damascus and Aleppo being more popular with investors due to their greater demand and higher rental yields. Rural areas, on the other hand, are generally less expensive but may offer lower rental yields and fewer amenities.\n\nThe Syrian government has implemented various initiatives to stimulate the property market, including offering subsidies and tax incentives to investors. These initiatives are aimed at encouraging investment in the sector and helping to drive economic growth. However, the market remains challenging, and investors need to be aware of the risks and complexities involved.\n\n[SECTION] Prices by Area [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area/City | Buy (per sqm, USD) | Rent (monthly, USD) | Type |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Damascus | 100 | 50 | Apartment |\n| Aleppo | 80 | 40 | Apartment |\n| Latakia | 120 | 60 | Apartment |\n| Homs | 60 | 30 | House |\n| Tartous | 100 | 50 | Apartment |\n| Deir ez-Zor | 40 | 20 | House |\n| Qamishli | 80 | 40 | Apartment |\n| Daraa | 60 | 30 | House |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Ownership Rules [/SECTION]\n- Foreigners are allowed to buy property in Syria, but they must obtain permission from the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n- Foreigners can only buy property for personal use, and they are not allowed to buy property for commercial purposes.\n- Foreigners can lease property for up to 99 years, but they must register the lease with the relevant authorities.\n- Foreign companies can buy property in Syria, but they must be registered with the Syrian Ministry of Economy and Foreign Trade.\n- Foreigners who buy property in Syria must pay a registration fee of 0.1% of the property's value.\n\n[SECTION] Buying Process [/SECTION]\n1.
