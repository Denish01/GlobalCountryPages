[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Syria's population size is significant in the context of the Middle East, and its growth trends have been affected by various factors, including conflict, urbanization, and migration patterns. The country has experienced a decline in population growth rate due to the ongoing conflict, which has resulted in a significant number of deaths and displacements.

Urbanization is also a significant trend in Syria, with approximately 58% of the population living in urban areas, primarily in cities such as Damascus, Aleppo, and Homs.

The conflict in Syria has led to a significant migration of people, both within the country and to neighboring countries. Many Syrians have fled to countries such as Turkey, Jordan, and Lebanon, while others have been displaced internally. This has put a strain on the resources and infrastructure of the host countries and has created a significant humanitarian crisis. The migration patterns in Syria are complex and have been influenced by various factors, including economic conditions, security concerns, and social networks.

The population of Syria is also affected by the country's economic conditions, which have been severely impacted by the conflict. The economy has contracted significantly, and the country is facing a severe crisis in terms of infrastructure, healthcare, and education. The population is also affected by the lack of access to basic services, such as electricity, water, and sanitation.
