The country can be divided into three main climate zones: the coastal region, the mountainous region, and the desert region. The coastal region has a Mediterranean climate, with warm summers and mild winters, while the mountainous region has a colder climate, with significant snowfall during the winter months. The desert region, which covers most of the country, has a hot and dry climate, with very little rainfall throughout the year. The dry season, which lasts from May to October, is characterized by hot temperatures and low humidity, while the wet season, which lasts from November to April, is marked by mild temperatures and occasional rainfall. The seasons can significantly affect travel in Syria, with the summer months being the peak tourist season, but also the hottest and most crowded, while the winter months are the low season, but can be cold and rainy.\n\nThe spring and autumn seasons are considered the best times to visit Syria, as the weather is mild and pleasant, making it ideal for sightseeing and outdoor activities.

The spring season, which lasts from March to May, is characterized by mild temperatures, ranging from 15°C to 25°C, and is marked by the blooming of flowers and greenery, making it a beautiful time to visit the country.
