[SECTION] Overview: Syria vs Turkey [/SECTION]
The cost of living in Syria and Turkey differs significantly due to various economic and historical factors. Syria has faced a severe economic crisis and ongoing conflict, leading to a decline in the value of its currency, the Syrian Pound (SYP), and a subsequent increase in prices. However, the country still remains relatively affordable compared to Turkey, which has a more developed economy and a higher cost of living. The difference in costs between the two countries can be attributed to factors such as the strength of their economies, the value of their currencies, and the availability of goods and services.

The economic context of both countries plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. Turkey has a more diversified economy with a strong service sector, while Syria's economy has been heavily reliant on oil exports. The ongoing conflict in Syria has also disrupted trade and led to a decline in the country's infrastructure, further contributing to the difference in costs. Overall, Syria is generally cheaper than Turkey, with an overall cost of living that is approximately 30-40% lower. However, it is essential to note that the cost of living in Syria can vary greatly depending on the location, with cities like Damascus and Aleppo tend to be more expensive than other parts of the country.
