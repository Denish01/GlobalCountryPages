  "content": "The infrastructure in Syria is underdeveloped and has been severely impacted by the ongoing civil war, with significant damage to roads, power plants, and water treatment facilities. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 83% of population\nInternet Penetration: 32%\nRoad Network: 40,000 km, moderate to poor quality\nRail Network: 2,052 km\nMajor Airports: 8\nMajor Ports: 2\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nSyria's infrastructure has been severely affected by the civil war, which started in 2011 and has caused significant damage to the country's infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and buildings. The war has also led to a significant decline in the country's economy, making it difficult for the government to invest in infrastructure development. Despite the challenges, the government has been working to rebuild and restore the country's infrastructure, with a focus on **reconstruction** and **rehabilitation** of damaged facilities. The infrastructure development in Syria is also hampered by the **urban-rural gap**, with urban areas generally having better access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation.\n\nThe Syrian government has been working to improve the country's infrastructure, with a focus on **transportation** and **energy**. The government has invested in the reconstruction of damaged roads and bridges, as well as the development of new transportation projects, such as the ** Damascus-Aleppo highway**. The government has also been working to improve the country's energy sector, with a focus on increasing **power generation** and reducing **power outages**.\n\nThe infrastructure in Syria is also affected by the **sanctions** imposed by Western countries, which have limited the country's access to international financing and technology. Despite these challenges, the Syrian government has been working to develop the country's infrastructure, with a focus on **self-sufficiency** and **domestic production**. The government has also been working to attract **foreign investment** in the infrastructure sector, with a focus on **public-private partnerships**.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 40,000 km | Moderate to poor | Many roads have been damaged or destroyed during the war |\n| Railways | 2,052 km | Poor | The railway network has been severely damaged during the war |\n| Airports | 8 international, 2 domestic | Moderate | Many airports have been damaged or closed during the war |\n| Ports | 2 major | Poor | The ports have been affected by the war and sanctions |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- The main source of **power generation** in Syria is **thermal power**, which accounts for about 70% of the country's power generation.\n- The country has been experiencing frequent **power outages**, due to the damage to the power grid and the lack of **fuel**.\n- The government has been working to increase the use of **renewable energy**, such as **solar** and **wind power**, to reduce the country's dependence on **fossil fuels**.\n- The **reliability** of the power supply is a major concern, with many areas experiencing frequent **blackouts**.\n- The government has been working to **rehabilitate** the damaged power plants and to **upgrade** the power grid, to improve the **efficiency** and **reliability** of the power supply.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- The **tap water** in Syria is not always **safe to drink**, due to the damage to the water treatment facilities and the lack of **chlorine**.\n- The **sanitation coverage** in Syria is about 90%, but the **quality** of the sanitation services is often **poor**.\n- The **water access** in rural areas is often **limited**, due to the damage to the water infrastructure and the lack of **maintenance**.\n- The government has been working to **rehabilitate** the damaged water treatment facilities and to **improve** the sanitation services, to reduce the **risk** of **water-borne diseases**.\n- The **conservation** of **water resources** is a major concern, due to the **drought** and the **over-extraction** of **groundwater**.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- The **mobile coverage** in Syria is about 80%, but the **quality** of the service is often **poor**.\n- The **fiber/broadband** penetration in Syria is about 10%, due to the lack of **investment** in the **telecom sector**.\n- The **4G/5G rollout** in Syria has been **delayed**, due to the **sanctions** and the lack of **foreign investment**.\n- The **postal services** in Syria are **limited**, due to the damage to the postal infrastructure and the lack of **funding**.\n- The government has been working to **improve** the telecommunications services, to reduce the **digital divide** and to **promote** the **use of technology**.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The Syrian government has been working on a **major highway project**, to connect the city of **Damascus** to the city of **Aleppo**.\n- The government has also been working on a **new port project**, to **upgrade** the **port of Latakia** and to **increase** the country's **trade**.\n- The **reconstruction** of the **damaged infrastructure** is a major priority, with a focus on **roads**, **bridges**, and **buildings**.\n- The government has also been working to **attract foreign investment**, to **finance** the **infrastructure projects** and to **promote** the **economic development**.\n- The **development of the telecom sector** is also a major priority, with a focus on **improving** the **mobile coverage** and the **broadband penetration**.",
