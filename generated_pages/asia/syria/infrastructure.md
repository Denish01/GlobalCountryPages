[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Syria's infrastructure has been severely affected by the civil war, which started in 2011 and has caused significant damage to the country's infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and buildings. The war has also led to a significant decline in the country's economy, making it difficult for the government to invest in infrastructure development. Despite the challenges, the government has been working to rebuild and restore the country's infrastructure, with a focus on **reconstruction** and **rehabilitation** of damaged facilities. The infrastructure development in Syria is also hampered by the **urban-rural gap**, with urban areas generally having better access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation.

The Syrian government has been working to improve the country's infrastructure, with a focus on **transportation** and **energy**. The government has invested in the reconstruction of damaged roads and bridges, as well as the development of new transportation projects, such as the ** Damascus-Aleppo highway**. The government has also been working to improve the country's energy sector, with a focus on increasing **power generation** and reducing **power outages**.

The infrastructure in Syria is also affected by the **sanctions** imposed by Western countries, which have limited the country's access to international financing and technology. Despite these challenges, the Syrian government has been working to develop the country's infrastructure, with a focus on **self-sufficiency** and **domestic production**. The government has also been working to attract **foreign investment** in the infrastructure sector, with a focus on **public-private partnerships**.
