[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Syria is relatively challenging, with a high demand for housing due to the large population and limited supply of properties. Typical lease terms in Syria range from 6-12 months, with a deposit requirement of 1-2 months' rent. Tenant rights are not well-established in Syria, and renters often have limited protection against eviction or rent increases. Compared to its regional neighbors, Syria's housing costs are relatively moderate, with countries like Lebanon and Jordan having higher rent prices, while Turkey and Iraq have more affordable options.

The Syrian housing market has been heavily impacted by the ongoing conflict, leading to a shortage of available properties and a significant increase in prices. However, in recent years, there has been a slight decrease in rent prices due to the economic downturn and the decline of the Syrian pound. Despite this, the housing market in Syria remains highly competitive, and renters often have to act quickly to secure a property. The government has implemented some measures to regulate the housing market and protect tenants, but more needs to be done to address the ongoing housing crisis.
