[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Syria has two main international airports, Damascus International Airport and Aleppo International Airport, which receive flights from various Middle Eastern and European cities. The most convenient way to reach Syria is by flying into Damascus International Airport, which has direct connections to major hubs like Dubai, Cairo, and Istanbul. Overland entry points are also available, with border crossings from neighboring countries like Turkey, Iraq, Jordan, Israel, and Lebanon. However, due to the current conflict, some border crossings may be closed or have restricted access.

Travelers can also enter Syria by land, using bus or taxi services from neighboring countries. For example, there are bus services from Beirut, Lebanon, to Damascus, and from Amman, Jordan, to Damascus. However, be sure to check the current security situation and any travel restrictions before attempting to cross the border by land. It is also essential to research and comply with all relevant visa requirements and regulations before entering Syria.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Syria's domestic air network is limited, with only a few airlines operating flights between major cities like Damascus, Aleppo, and Latakia. Syrian Arab Airlines is the main domestic carrier, offering flights between these cities. However, due to the conflict, flight schedules and availability may be unpredictable, and it is essential to check with the airline for the latest information. Booking tips include checking the airline's website or contacting a local travel agent, and approximate costs for domestic flights can range from $50 to $200, depending on the route and airline.
