[SECTION] How Syria Is Divided [/SECTION]
Syria is divided into 14 governorates, also known as muhafazat, which are the primary administrative divisions of the country. These governorates are further divided into districts, known as manatiq, and then into subdistricts, known as nawahi. Each governorate has its own capital city, which serves as the administrative center for the region. The governorates are responsible for providing various public services, such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure, to the local population.

The administrative structure of Syria is centralized, with the central government in Damascus having significant control over the governorates. However, each governorate has a degree of autonomy, with its own governor and council, which are responsible for overseeing the local administration and implementing national policies. This structure has been in place since the country gained independence in 1946 and has undergone several changes over the years to reflect the country's evolving needs and demographics.
