[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Syria is overseen by the Ministry of Education, with a strong emphasis on **Arabic language** and **Islamic studies**. Public education is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to private institutions, with limited resources and outdated curricula. However, public schools are free or heavily subsidized, making them accessible to a large portion of the population. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a more comprehensive education, with better facilities and more qualified teachers, but at a significantly higher cost. International schools are also available in major cities, catering to the children of expatriates and wealthy locals, and offering curricula such as the **International Baccalaureate** or **British A-levels**.

The compulsory education period in Syria spans 12 years, from age 6 to 18, with students typically attending primary school for 6 years, followed by 3 years of intermediate school, and finally 3 years of secondary school. The academic year typically runs from September to June, with a 2-month summer break. Despite the challenges faced by the education system in Syria, including a shortage of qualified teachers and inadequate infrastructure, the country has made significant progress in increasing access to education, particularly for girls and women.
