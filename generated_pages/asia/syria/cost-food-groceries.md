[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Food prices in Syria are generally higher than the regional average, driven up by factors such as inflation, transportation costs, and import duties. The country's **inflation rate** of 13.4% in 2019 has contributed to the increasing cost of living, making it challenging for locals to afford basic necessities. Despite these challenges, Syrians still maintain a strong **eating-out culture**, with many restaurants and cafes offering a range of traditional dishes at varying price points. However, due to economic constraints, **home cooking** has become a more popular option, with many people opting to prepare meals at home using locally sourced ingredients.

The **GDP per capita PPP** of $4,772 in 2022 indicates a relatively low standard of living, which is reflected in the country's food prices. While some staples like **bread** and **eggs** are relatively affordable, other items like **meat** and **dairy products** can be quite expensive. The **out-of-pocket health spend** of 72.4% in 2023 also means that many Syrians have to prioritize their spending, often choosing cheaper food options over more expensive ones. As a result, the **local markets** and **street food** scenes have become increasingly popular, offering a range of affordable and traditional food options.

[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]
When it comes to shopping for groceries, Syrians often have to choose between **supermarkets** and **local markets**. While supermarkets offer a wider range of products, including imported goods, local markets tend to be cheaper and offer fresher produce. The price difference between the two can be significant, with some items costing up to 50% more in supermarkets. However, supermarkets often offer a more convenient shopping experience, with air-conditioning and a wider range of products. In contrast, local markets can be crowded and chaotic, but they offer a more authentic shopping experience and the opportunity to **bargain** with vendors.

In general, it's recommended to buy **fresh produce** and **meat** at local markets, where prices are lower and quality is often higher. For **packaged goods** and **imported products**, supermarkets may be a better option. However, it's always a good idea to compare prices and look for deals, regardless of where you shop. [CALLOUT] Be sure to check the expiration dates and quality of products before purchasing, especially when shopping at local markets.
