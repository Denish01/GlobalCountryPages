[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The Syrian property market has been severely impacted by the ongoing conflict, which has resulted in a significant decline in property values and a shortage of housing. Despite this, there are still opportunities for investment, particularly in areas that have been less affected by the conflict. The market is currently characterized by low demand and high supply, which has driven down prices and made it a buyer's market. However, the market is expected to recover in the long term, driven by government efforts to rebuild and restore damaged infrastructure.

The price trajectory of the Syrian property market has been volatile, with prices fluctuating significantly over the past few years. However, prices are currently at a low point, making it an attractive time to invest. The market can be broadly divided into urban and rural areas, with urban areas such as Damascus and Aleppo being more popular with investors due to their greater demand and higher rental yields. Rural areas, on the other hand, are generally less expensive but may offer lower rental yields and fewer amenities.

The Syrian government has implemented various initiatives to stimulate the property market, including offering subsidies and tax incentives to investors. These initiatives are aimed at encouraging investment in the sector and helping to drive economic growth. However, the market remains challenging, and investors need to be aware of the risks and complexities involved.
