[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
The main transportation modes in Syria include buses, taxis, and minivans, with most people relying on these options to get around. The quality of public transit varies between cities, with larger cities like Damascus and Aleppo having more extensive networks, while smaller towns and rural areas have limited options. In general, Syrians rely heavily on private transportation, with many people owning their own vehicles or using taxis and ride-hailing services.

The transportation infrastructure in Syria has been severely impacted by the ongoing conflict, with many roads and public transportation systems damaged or destroyed. As a result, transportation costs can be high, and options may be limited. However, many Syrians have adapted to these challenges by using alternative modes of transportation, such as bicycles or motorcycles, and by sharing rides with friends and family.
