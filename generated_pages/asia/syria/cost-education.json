  "content": "The cost of education in Syria varies greatly depending on the type of institution and the student's residency status, with public schools being generally free or subsidized, while private schools and international institutions can range from a few hundred to several thousand dollars per year.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nEducation Spend (% GDP): 3.2% (2020 est.)\nLiteracy Rate: 86.4% (2020 est.)\nSchool System: 12 years of compulsory education\nAcademic Year: 9 months\nCurrency: SYP\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe education system in Syria is overseen by the Ministry of Education, with a strong emphasis on **Arabic language** and **Islamic studies**. Public education is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to private institutions, with limited resources and outdated curricula. However, public schools are free or heavily subsidized, making them accessible to a large portion of the population. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a more comprehensive education, with better facilities and more qualified teachers, but at a significantly higher cost. International schools are also available in major cities, catering to the children of expatriates and wealthy locals, and offering curricula such as the **International Baccalaureate** or **British A-levels**.\n\nThe compulsory education period in Syria spans 12 years, from age 6 to 18, with students typically attending primary school for 6 years, followed by 3 years of intermediate school, and finally 3 years of secondary school. The academic year typically runs from September to June, with a 2-month summer break. Despite the challenges faced by the education system in Syria, including a shortage of qualified teachers and inadequate infrastructure, the country has made significant progress in increasing access to education, particularly for girls and women.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 (free) | Limited resources, outdated curricula |\n| Private Primary | $200-$1,000 | Range by tier, better facilities and teachers |\n| Public Secondary | $0 (free) | Limited resources, outdated curricula |\n| Private Secondary | $500-$2,500 | Range by tier, better facilities and teachers |\n| International School | $2,000-$10,000 | Curriculum types include IB, British A-levels |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $100-$500 | $500-$1,000 | Limited programs, outdated facilities |\n| Private University | $1,000-$5,000 | $2,000-$10,000 | Better facilities, more programs available |\n| Top-Ranked University | $2,000-$10,000 | $5,000-$20,000 | Includes universities like Damascus University |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $50-$200 | Limited availability, especially outside major cities |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $10-$50 | Common practice, especially for exam preparation |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $50-$200 | Includes courses in English, French, and other languages |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $20-$100 | Basic supplies, including textbooks and stationery |\n| School Uniform | $20-$50 | Mandatory in most schools, including public institutions |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The **best schools for expats** are typically international institutions, offering a high-quality education and a diverse student body.\n- **Scholarship availability** is limited, but some universities and institutions offer financial aid to deserving students.\n- **Online learning options** are becoming increasingly popular, especially for students who cannot access traditional educational institutions.\n- Education quality in Syria is generally considered to be lower compared to other countries in the region, due to limited resources and outdated curricula.\n- **Private tutoring** is a common practice, especially for exam preparation, and can be an effective way to supplement a student's education.\n- **Language courses** are widely available, and can be an excellent way to improve language skills and enhance job prospects.",
