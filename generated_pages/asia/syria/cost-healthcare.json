  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Syria varies greatly between public and private facilities, with out-of-pocket expenses making up a significant portion of healthcare spending, and the overall cost ranging from a few dollars for basic services to several hundred dollars for more complex procedures.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $33 (2023)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 72.4% (2023)\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 110\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: SYP\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nSyria's healthcare system is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality and less well-equipped than private facilities, but it is often more affordable for locals. For foreigners, private healthcare facilities are usually the best option, as they offer higher quality care and are more likely to have staff who speak English. However, even in private facilities, the standard of care can vary greatly depending on the location and the specific hospital or clinic. It is highly recommended that individuals have some form of health insurance to cover unexpected medical expenses, as out-of-pocket costs can be very high.\n\nThe Syrian healthcare system is facing significant challenges, including a shortage of medical staff and equipment, as well as a lack of access to healthcare services in some areas. Despite these challenges, there are still many high-quality healthcare providers in Syria, and with the right insurance and planning, it is possible to receive good care. It's worth noting that the healthcare system in Syria is not universal, and many people rely on private healthcare providers or out-of-pocket payments to access medical care.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $5-$10 | $20-$50 | Prices vary by city and doctor |\n| Specialist Consultation | $10-$20 | $50-$100 | Prices vary by specialty and location |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-$20 | $30-$70 | Prices vary by dentist and location |\n| Eye Exam | $5-$10 | $20-$50 | Prices vary by optometrist and location |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $30-$70 | Prices vary by lab and location |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$100 | Prices vary by hospital and severity of condition |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $50-$200 | Prices vary by hospital and type of room |\n| Basic Surgery | $200-$1,000 | Prices vary by procedure and surgeon |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $500-$2,000 | Prices vary by hospital and type of delivery |\n| MRI Scan | $100-$500 | Prices vary by hospital and type of scan |\n| X-Ray | $10-$50 | Prices vary by hospital and type of X-ray |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Covers basic medical services, including doctor visits and hospital stays |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-$300 | Covers a wide range of medical services, including specialist consultations and surgeries |\n| International / Expat | $200-$500 | Covers medical services worldwide, including evacuations and repatriations |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medications are widely available in Syrian pharmacies, but prices can vary greatly depending on the medication and location.\n- Over-the-counter medications are also widely available, but prices can be higher than in other countries.\n- Many pharmacies in Syria are open 24 hours a day, but it's always best to call ahead to confirm hours and availability.\n- Some medications may be difficult to find in Syria, so it's a good idea to bring any necessary medications with you when traveling.\n- The cost of medications in Syria can range from a few dollars for basic medications to several hundred dollars for more specialized treatments.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it's best to call the local emergency number, 110, or seek out the nearest hospital or clinic. Many hospitals in Syria have emergency rooms, but the quality of care can vary greatly depending on the hospital and location. For foreigners, it's often best to seek out private hospitals, which tend to have better facilities and more English-speaking staff. Some of the best hospitals for foreigners in Syria include the Syrian American Hospital in Damascus and the Al-Sham Hospital in Aleppo. It's always a good idea to have a plan in place for emergency medical care, including knowing the location of the nearest hospital and having a way to pay for any necessary treatments.",
