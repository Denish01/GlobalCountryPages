[SECTION] Overall Safety Assessment [/SECTION]
Syria has been embroiled in a devastating civil war since 2011, which has resulted in significant damage to the country's infrastructure, economy, and social fabric. The conflict has led to a substantial increase in crime, including petty theft, kidnapping, and violent attacks. Additionally, the presence of various armed groups and extremist organizations has created a highly unstable environment, making it difficult for tourists to ensure their safety. The Syrian government has limited control over certain areas, and the rule of law is often absent, further exacerbating the security risks.

The situation is particularly dire in areas outside of the capital city, Damascus, where the government's control is tenuous at best. The risk of being caught in the crossfire, kidnapped, or injured in a bomb blast is high, and tourists should exercise extreme caution when traveling to or within the country. Furthermore, the lack of basic services, including healthcare, sanitation, and electricity, has created a humanitarian crisis, making it challenging for tourists to access essential services. In light of these risks, it is essential for tourists to carefully consider their travel plans and prioritize their safety above all else.
