These governorates are further divided into districts, known as manatiq, and then into subdistricts, known as nawahi. Each governorate has its own capital city, which serves as the administrative center for the region. The governorates are responsible for providing various public services, such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure, to the local population.\n\nThe administrative structure of Syria is centralized, with the central government in Damascus having significant control over the governorates. However, each governorate has a degree of autonomy, with its own governor and council, which are responsible for overseeing the local administration and implementing national policies. This structure has been in place since the country gained independence in 1946 and has undergone several changes over the years to reflect the country's evolving needs and demographics.\n\n[SECTION] Major Cities [/SECTION]\n**Damascus** (population estimate 2.1 million)\nRole: capital city\nKnown For: its rich history, cultural landmarks, and traditional souks\nBest For: history buffs, cultural enthusiasts, and those looking to experience the traditional Syrian way of life\n\n**Aleppo** (population estimate 4.6 million)\nRole: economic hub\nKnown For: its vibrant markets, historic old city, and traditional cuisine\nBest For: foodies, shoppers, and those interested in exploring the country's economic and cultural center\n\n**Homs** (population estimate 1.1 million)\nRole: industrial center\nKnown For: its oil refineries, historic landmarks, and traditional crafts\nBest For: industrial tourists, history enthusiasts, and those looking to experience the country's industrial heritage\n\n**Latakia** (population estimate 0.5 million)\nRole: port city\nKnown For: its beautiful beaches, historic landmarks, and vibrant cultural scene\nBest For: beachgoers, history enthusiasts, and those looking to experience the country's Mediterranean coast\n\n**Hama** (population estimate 0.7 million)\nRole: agricultural center\nKnown For: its historic waterwheels, traditional crafts, and scenic countryside\nBest For: nature lovers, history enthusiasts, and those looking to experience the country's rural way of life\n\n[SECTION] Key Regions [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Region | Character | Known For | Major City |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Damascus Governorate | mountainous | historic landmarks, cultural events | Damascus |\n| Aleppo Governorate | urban | vibrant markets, traditional cuisine | Aleppo |\n| Homs Governorate | industrial | oil refineries, historic landmarks | Homs |\n| Latakia Governorate | coastal | beautiful beaches, historic landmarks | Latakia |\n| Hama Governorate | rural | historic waterwheels, traditional crafts | Hama |\n| Tartous Governorate | coastal | scenic coastline, historic landmarks | Tartous |\n| Quneitra Governorate | mountainous | historic landmarks, natural scenery | Quneitra |\n| Deir ez-Zor Governorate | desert | historic landmarks, traditional Bedouin culture | Deir ez-Zor |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Differences [/SECTION]\n- The coastal regions, such as Latakia and Tartous, have a distinct Mediterranean culture and economy, with a strong focus on tourism and trade.\n- The eastern regions, such as Deir ez-Zor and Hasakah, have a more tribal and Bedouin culture, with a strong focus on agriculture and livestock.\n- The mountainous regions, such as Damascus and Quneitra, have a more urban and cosmopolitan culture, with a strong focus on education and healthcare.\n- The rural regions, such as Hama and Homs, have a more traditional and agricultural way of life, with a strong focus on family and community.\n\n[SECTION] Getting Around [/SECTION]\nSyria has a well-developed transportation network, with domestic flights, trains, and buses connecting major cities and towns.
