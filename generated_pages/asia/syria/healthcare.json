  "content": "Healthcare in Syria is a challenging and evolving system that has been severely impacted by the ongoing civil war, with significant disparities in access to quality care, particularly between urban and rural areas.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nQuality Rating: 2/5\nEmergency Number: 110\nHospital Standard: Basic\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: moderate\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nThe Syrian healthcare system is a mixed model, with both public and private providers playing a role. The public sector is responsible for providing primary healthcare services, while private hospitals and clinics offer more specialized care. However, the system has been severely strained due to the ongoing conflict, with many healthcare facilities damaged or destroyed, and a significant shortage of medical personnel and supplies. In urban areas, such as Damascus and Aleppo, access to healthcare is generally better, with more facilities and specialized care available. In contrast, rural areas often have limited access to healthcare services, with few facilities and a lack of specialized care.\n\nThe quality of care in Syria is also a concern, with many healthcare facilities lacking basic equipment and supplies. Additionally, the conflict has led to a significant brain drain, with many medical professionals leaving the country. Despite these challenges, there are efforts underway to rebuild and strengthen the healthcare system, including the establishment of new healthcare facilities and the training of medical personnel.\n\nThe Syrian government has also implemented initiatives to improve access to healthcare, particularly for vulnerable populations, such as refugees and internally displaced persons. However, more needs to be done to address the significant healthcare needs of the population, particularly in rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Al-Assad University Hospital | Damascus | Public | General medicine, surgery, pediatrics | Limited |\n| Damascus Hospital | Damascus | Private | Cardiology, oncology, neurology | Yes |\n| Aleppo University Hospital | Aleppo | Public | General medicine, surgery, pediatrics | Limited |\n| Al-Kindi Hospital | Damascus | Private | Cardiology, orthopedics, urology | Yes |\n| Al-Mouwasat University Hospital | Damascus | Private | General medicine, surgery, pediatrics | Yes |\n| Ibn Al-Nafis Hospital | Damascus | Public | General medicine, surgery, pediatrics | Limited |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Private health insurance** is recommended for all individuals, particularly those who can afford it, as it provides access to better quality care and more specialized services.\n- **Local insurance options** are available, but may not provide the same level of coverage as international insurance plans.\n- **Expats and foreigners** are advised to purchase international health insurance that covers them in Syria, as local insurance options may not be sufficient.\n- **Costs** of healthcare services can be high, particularly in private hospitals and clinics, so it is essential to have adequate insurance coverage.\n- **Government-funded insurance** is available for Syrian citizens, but the quality of care and services may vary.\n- **Supplementary insurance** may be necessary to cover additional services, such as dental and vision care.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Availability of medications** can be limited, particularly in rural areas, due to shortages and supply chain disruptions.\n- **Prescription requirements** vary, but many medications are available over-the-counter.\n- **Common brands** of medications may not be available, and generic alternatives may be the only option.\n- **Costs** of medications can be high, particularly for imported brands.\n- **Pharmacy access** is moderate, with many pharmacies available in urban areas, but fewer in rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Required vaccinations** include hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and typhoid, as well as routine vaccinations such as MMR and DTaP.\n- **Recommended vaccinations** include rabies, meningitis, and polio, depending on the individual's risk factors and activities.\n- **Endemic diseases** include tuberculosis, malaria, and leishmaniasis, which are prevalent in certain areas of the country.\n- **Water safety** is a concern, with many areas having contaminated water supplies, so it is essential to drink bottled or filtered water.\n- **Food safety** is also a concern, with many foodborne illnesses reported, so it is essential to eat at reputable restaurants and avoid undercooked or raw foods.\n- **Insect-borne diseases** such as mosquito-borne illnesses are also present, so it is essential to take precautions such as using insect repellent and wearing protective clothing.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **Medical tourism** is not a significant industry in Syria, due to the ongoing conflict and limited healthcare infrastructure.\n- **Accredited hospitals** are few, and many healthcare facilities lack international accreditation.\n- **Cost savings** may be available for certain procedures, but the quality of care and services may vary.\n- **Popular procedures** are not well-established, as the healthcare system is primarily focused on providing basic medical care.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- **Emergency services** are available, but may be limited, particularly in rural areas.\n- **Ambulance reliability** is a concern, with many ambulances lacking basic equipment and supplies.\n- **Nearest hospitals** may be far away, particularly in rural areas, so it is essential to have a plan in place in case of an emergency.\n- **Insurance claims** may be difficult to process, particularly for foreigners, so it is essential to have adequate insurance coverage and to keep records of all medical expenses.\n- **Emergency contact numbers** include 110 for emergency services and 112 for ambulance services.",
