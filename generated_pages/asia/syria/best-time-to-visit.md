[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Syria has a diverse climate, with four distinct seasons, varying from the Mediterranean coastal region to the desert interior. The country can be divided into three main climate zones: the coastal region, the mountainous region, and the desert region. The coastal region has a Mediterranean climate, with warm summers and mild winters, while the mountainous region has a colder climate, with significant snowfall during the winter months. The desert region, which covers most of the country, has a hot and dry climate, with very little rainfall throughout the year. The dry season, which lasts from May to October, is characterized by hot temperatures and low humidity, while the wet season, which lasts from November to April, is marked by mild temperatures and occasional rainfall. The seasons can significantly affect travel in Syria, with the summer months being the peak tourist season, but also the hottest and most crowded, while the winter months are the low season, but can be cold and rainy.

The spring and autumn seasons are considered the best times to visit Syria, as the weather is mild and pleasant, making it ideal for sightseeing and outdoor activities. During these seasons, the temperatures are warm but not hot, and the crowds are smaller compared to the peak summer months. The spring season, which lasts from March to May, is characterized by mild temperatures, ranging from 15°C to 25°C, and is marked by the blooming of flowers and greenery, making it a beautiful time to visit the country. The autumn season, which lasts from September to November, is also mild, with temperatures ranging from 10°C to 20°C, and is marked by the harvest season, with many festivals and events taking place throughout the country.

The summer months, which last from June to August, are the peak tourist season in Syria, but are also the hottest and most crowded. The temperatures during this time can reach up to 40°C, making it difficult to sightsee and engage in outdoor activities. The winter months, which last from December to February, are the low season, and can be cold and rainy, with temperatures ranging from 0°C to 10°C. However, this time can be a good opportunity to visit the ski resorts in the mountainous regions, such as the Bloudan ski resort.
