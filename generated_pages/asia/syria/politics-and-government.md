[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The Syrian government operates under a **unitary system**, where the central government holds significant power over the various provinces and districts. The **presidential republic** model grants the president substantial authority, including the power to appoint the prime minister, ministers, and other high-ranking officials. The **separation of powers** between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches is not strictly adhered to, as the president's influence extends into all branches. This concentration of power has led to concerns about **authoritarianism** and the erosion of democratic principles. The Syrian government has faced criticism for its human rights record and the suppression of opposition.

The **Syrian Constitution**, adopted in 2012, outlines the framework of the government and the relationship between the branches. However, the document has been criticized for not providing adequate checks on the president's power. The government has also been accused of **human rights abuses**, including the use of **torture**, **forced disappearances**, and **extrajudicial killings**. The international community has called for greater **transparency** and **accountability** in the Syrian government's actions.

The Syrian government's **legislative branch**, the People's Council, is composed of 250 members elected by **universal suffrage** for four-year terms. While the council has the power to pass laws and approve the government's budget, its ability to hold the executive branch accountable is limited. The **judicial branch** is composed of various courts, including the **Supreme Constitutional Court**, which has the power to interpret the constitution and review the constitutionality of laws.
