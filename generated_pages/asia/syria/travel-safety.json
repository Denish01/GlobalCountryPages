The conflict has led to a substantial increase in crime, including petty theft, kidnapping, and violent attacks. Additionally, the presence of various armed groups and extremist organizations has created a highly unstable environment, making it difficult for tourists to ensure their safety. The Syrian government has limited control over certain areas, and the rule of law is often absent, further exacerbating the security risks.\n\nThe situation is particularly dire in areas outside of the capital city, Damascus, where the government's control is tenuous at best. The risk of being caught in the crossfire, kidnapped, or injured in a bomb blast is high, and tourists should exercise extreme caution when traveling to or within the country. Furthermore, the lack of basic services, including healthcare, sanitation, and electricity, has created a humanitarian crisis, making it challenging for tourists to access essential services. In light of these risks, it is essential for tourists to carefully consider their travel plans and prioritize their safety above all else.\n\n[SECTION] Safety By Area [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area/Region | Safety Level | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Damascus | Moderate | Relatively safer than other areas, but still prone to violence and crime |\n| Aleppo | High Risk | Heavily damaged and still experiencing occasional violence |\n| Homs | High Risk | Significant damage and ongoing violence |\n| Latakia | Moderate | Relatively stable, but still subject to occasional attacks |\n| Palmyra | High Risk | Historic site has been heavily damaged and is still a conflict zone |\n| Deir ez-Zor | High Risk | Ongoing violence and instability |\n| Raqqa | High Risk | Former ISIS stronghold, still experiencing violence and instability |\n| Border areas | High Risk | Prone to violence, kidnapping, and smuggling |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Common Risks & Scams [/SECTION]\n- **Kidnapping**: a significant risk, particularly in areas outside of Damascus\n- **Bomb blasts**: a risk in areas with high levels of violence, such as Aleppo and Homs\n- **Petty theft**: common in crowded areas and tourist hotspots\n- **Scams**: tourists may be targeted by scammers, particularly in areas with limited law enforcement\n- **Armed robbery**: a risk, particularly at night or in isolated areas\n- **Roadblocks**: tourists may encounter roadblocks, which can be hazardous and unpredictable\n- **False checkpoints**: tourists may be stopped at false checkpoints, which can be used to extort money or commit crimes\n- **Landmines**: a risk in areas that have experienced conflict, particularly in rural areas\n\n[SECTION] Health & Medical [/SECTION]\n- **Vaccinations**: tourists should ensure they are up-to-date on all recommended vaccinations, including hepatitis A, typhoid, and rabies\n- **Water Safety**: tap water is not safe to drink, and tourists should stick to bottled or filtered water\n- **Medical Facilities**: medical facilities are limited, particularly outside of Damascus, and tourists may need to be evacuated to another country for medical treatment\n- **Pharmacy Access**: pharmacies are available in major cities, but the quality and availability of medications may be limited\n\n[SECTION] Practical Safety Tips [/SECTION]\n- Avoid traveling at night or in isolated areas\n- Stay informed about local conditions and follow government advisories\n- Keep a low profile and avoid drawing attention to yourself\n- Avoid displaying signs of wealth, such as expensive jewelry or watches\n- Stay in touch with family and friends back home and keep them informed of your itinerary\n- Avoid using taxis or other forms of public transportation, particularly at night\n- Keep your hotel room door locked and use the hotel safe to store valuables\n- Be aware of your surroundings and trust your instincts - if a situation feels unsafe, it probably is\n\n[SECTION] For Solo & Women Travelers [/SECTION]\n- **Dress modestly**: women should dress conservatively and avoid drawing attention to themselves\n- **Avoid traveling alone**: solo travelers, particularly women, should avoid traveling alone and consider joining a guided tour or traveling with a group\n- **Stay in touch with family and friends**: solo travelers should stay in touch with family and friends back home and keep them informed of their itinerary\n- **Be cautious of strangers**: solo travelers should be cautious of strangers, particularly men, and avoid accepting rides or invitations from people they do not know",
