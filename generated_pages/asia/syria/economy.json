  "content": "Syria's economy is a complex and struggling system, driven by a mix of state-owned enterprises, private sector activity, and foreign investment, with a significant impact from years of civil war and international sanctions. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nGDP (nominal): ($24.6 billion estimate)\nGDP Per Capita: ($1,244 estimate)\nIncome Classification: Lower-Middle\nMain Industries: Agriculture, Oil and Gas, Manufacturing\nCurrency: SYP\nUnemployment Rate: (approximate 50%)\nEase of Doing Business: (ranked 179 out of 190 countries)\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]\nSyria's economy is classified as a lower-middle-income economy, with a GDP per capita of around $1,244. The country has a mixed economy, with a significant role for state-owned enterprises, particularly in strategic sectors such as oil and gas, and telecommunications. However, the economy has been severely impacted by the ongoing civil war, which has resulted in significant damage to infrastructure, a decline in oil production, and a sharp decrease in foreign investment. The economy has also been subject to international sanctions, which have limited the country's access to foreign markets and finance.\n\nThe Syrian economy has historically been driven by the agricultural and oil sectors, with the country being a significant producer of cotton, wheat, and olive oil. However, the oil sector has been severely impacted by the civil war, with production declining significantly. The manufacturing sector has also been affected, with many factories forced to close due to a lack of raw materials and equipment. The services sector, including tourism, has also been severely impacted by the conflict.\n\nThe Syrian government has implemented a number of economic reforms in recent years, aimed at liberalizing the economy and encouraging private sector investment. However, the pace of reform has been slow, and the economy remains heavily dependent on state-owned enterprises. The government has also sought to promote economic development through investment in infrastructure, including the construction of new roads, bridges, and telecommunications networks.\n\n[SECTION] Key Industries [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Industry | Contribution | Details |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Agriculture | 20% of GDP | Main crops include cotton, wheat, and olive oil, with a significant portion of the population employed in the sector |\n| Oil and Gas | 15% of GDP | Syria is a significant producer of oil, with the majority of production coming from fields in the eastern part of the country |\n| Manufacturing | 10% of GDP | Main products include textiles, food processing, and construction materials, with many factories forced to close due to the conflict |\n| Services | 40% of GDP | Includes sectors such as tourism, finance, and telecommunications, which have been severely impacted by the conflict |\n| Mining | 5% of GDP | Main minerals include phosphate, gypsum, and salt, with a number of small-scale mines operating in the country |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Trade Profile [/SECTION]\n**Top Exports:** \n- **Crude oil**, which is the country's main export commodity\n- **Refined petroleum products**, which are exported to neighboring countries\n- **Textiles**, including cotton and wool products\n- **Food products**, such as olive oil and fruits\n- **Phosphate**, which is used in the production of fertilizers\n\n**Top Imports:** \n- **Machinery**, including equipment for the oil and gas sector\n- **Vehicles**, including cars and trucks\n- **Electronics**, including computers and telecommunications equipment\n- **Food products**, including wheat and sugar\n- **Pharmaceuticals**, which are imported to meet the country's healthcare needs\n\n**Key Trading Partners:** \n- Turkey, which is a significant trading partner for Syria\n- Iraq, which imports oil and other products from Syria\n- Jordan, which trades with Syria through the Arab Free Trade Area agreement\n- Lebanon, which is an important market for Syrian exports\n- China, which is a significant investor in the Syrian economy\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n- The transport network in Syria includes a number of major highways, including the Damascus-Aleppo highway, which connects the two main cities\n- The country has a number of ports, including the port of Latakia, which is the main hub for imports and exports\n- The energy sector is dominated by oil and gas, with a number of power plants generating electricity for the national grid\n- Internet and mobile penetration are relatively low, with around 30% of the population having access to the internet\n- The country has a number of international airports, including Damascus International Airport, which is the main hub for air travel\n\n[SECTION] Economic Outlook [/SECTION]\nThe Syrian economy is expected to continue to face significant challenges in the coming years, including a decline in oil production, a lack of foreign investment, and a slow pace of economic reform. However, the government has announced a number of major development projects, including the construction of a new highway connecting Damascus to the port city of Latakia, and the development of a number of industrial zones. The government has also sought to promote economic development through investment in human capital, including education and healthcare.\n\nThe Syrian economy has the potential to recover and grow in the long term, driven by the country's strategic location, rich natural resources, and highly educated population. However, this will require significant investment in infrastructure, including the rebuilding of damaged roads, bridges, and buildings, as well as the development of new sectors such as tourism and technology. The government will also need to implement economic reforms, including the liberalization of the economy and the promotion of private sector investment, in order to create a favorable business environment and attract foreign investment.",
