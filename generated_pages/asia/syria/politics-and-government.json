The **presidential republic** model grants the president substantial authority, including the power to appoint the prime minister, ministers, and other high-ranking officials. The **separation of powers** between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches is not strictly adhered to, as the president's influence extends into all branches. This concentration of power has led to concerns about **authoritarianism** and the erosion of democratic principles. The Syrian government has faced criticism for its human rights record and the suppression of opposition.\n\nThe **Syrian Constitution**, adopted in 2012, outlines the framework of the government and the relationship between the branches. However, the document has been criticized for not providing adequate checks on the president's power. The government has also been accused of **human rights abuses**, including the use of **torture**, **forced disappearances**, and **extrajudicial killings**. The international community has called for greater **transparency** and **accountability** in the Syrian government's actions.\n\nThe Syrian government's **legislative branch**, the People's Council, is composed of 250 members elected by **universal suffrage** for four-year terms. While the council has the power to pass laws and approve the government's budget, its ability to hold the executive branch accountable is limited. The **judicial branch** is composed of various courts, including the **Supreme Constitutional Court**, which has the power to interpret the constitution and review the constitutionality of laws.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | Presidency | President Bashar al-Assad | Head of State and Government |\n| Executive | Council of Ministers | Prime Minister Hussein Arnous | Head of Government |\n| Legislative | People's Council | Speaker Hammouda Sabbagh | Unicameral legislature |\n| Judicial | Supreme Constitutional Court | Chief Justice | Constitutional interpretation and review |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Major Political Parties [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Party | Position | Leader | Seats | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party | Center-left | Bashar al-Assad | 134 | Dominant party in Syrian politics |\n| Syrian Social Nationalist Party | Right-wing | Fares al-Saqqal | 3 | Nationalist party with limited representation |\n| People's Will Party | Left-wing | Qadri Jamil | 2 | Opposition party with limited influence |\n| Syrian Democratic People's Party | Left-wing | Ghayath Azizi | 1 | Opposition party with limited representation |\n| National Progressive Front | Left-wing | Various | 134 | Coalition of parties loyal to the Ba'ath Party |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Elections [/SECTION]\n- The **electoral system** in Syria is based on **universal suffrage**, with all citizens aged 18 and above eligible to vote.\n- **Presidential elections** are held every seven years, with the most recent election taking place in 2021.\n- The **last parliamentary election** was held in 2020, with the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party winning the majority of seats.\n- **Voter participation** has been a concern in Syrian elections, with many citizens boycotting the polls due to concerns about the legitimacy of the process.\n\n[SECTION] Political Stability & Challenges [/SECTION]\n- The **current political climate** in Syria is marked by ongoing **conflict** and **humanitarian crisis**, with the government facing opposition from various rebel groups and extremist organizations.\n- **Key issues** facing the Syrian government include **reconstruction**, **refugee repatriation**, and **economic recovery**.\n- The **regional dynamics** of the Syrian conflict are complex, with **Turkey**, **Iran**, and **Russia** playing significant roles in supporting various factions.\n- **Freedom indices** have consistently ranked Syria as one of the least free countries in the world, with concerns about **press freedom**, **assembly**, and **association**.\n- The **international community** has called for a **peaceful resolution** to the conflict, with the **United Nations** playing a key role in facilitating negotiations.\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Relations [/SECTION]\n- **Key alliances** for Syria include its relationships with **Iran** and **Russia**, which have provided significant military and economic support to the government.\n- Syria is a member of various **international organizations**, including the **United Nations** and the **Arab League**.\n- The **diplomatic stance** of the Syrian government has been marked by **isolation**, with many countries suspending diplomatic relations due to concerns about human rights and the conflict.\n- **Regional relationships** are complex, with Syria's borders with **Turkey**, **Iraq**, and **Israel** being particularly sensitive.\n- The **European Union** and the **United States** have imposed **sanctions** on Syria due to concerns about human rights and the conflict.",
