The market has experienced a steady increase in prices over the years, with a slight slowdown in recent times due to government regulations aimed at cooling down the market. The prices in urban areas such as Seoul are significantly higher than in rural areas, with the average price per square meter in Seoul being around $4,500 USD. The market is also influenced by the country's strong economy, high standard of living, and proximity to major cities in Asia.\n\nThe current market conditions in South Korea are characterized by a mix of government intervention and market forces. The government has implemented various measures to control the market, such as increasing property taxes and tightening lending regulations. However, the demand for property remains high, driven by a growing population and a strong economy. The price trajectory of the market is expected to continue its upward trend, albeit at a slower pace.\n\nThe urban-rural divide in South Korea is significant, with urban areas offering better infrastructure, amenities, and job opportunities. The rural areas, on the other hand, offer a more relaxed pace of life and a lower cost of living. However, the rural areas are also experiencing a decline in population, which can affect the local economy and property prices.\n\n[SECTION] Prices by Area [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area/City | Buy (per sqm, USD) | Rent (monthly, USD) | Type |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Seoul | 4,500 | 1,500 | Apartment |\n| Busan | 2,500 | 800 | Apartment |\n| Daegu | 2,000 | 600 | House |\n| Incheon | 3,000 | 1,000 | Apartment |\n| Gyeonggi | 2,800 | 900 | House |\n| Daejeon | 1,800 | 500 | Apartment |\n| Ulsan | 2,200 | 700 | House |\n| Jeju Island | 3,500 | 1,200 | Villa |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Ownership Rules [/SECTION]\n- Foreigners are allowed to buy property in South Korea, but they must register with the relevant authorities and obtain a registration number.\n- Foreigners are not allowed to buy property in certain areas, such as military zones or areas near the border with North Korea.\n- Foreigners can lease property for a maximum period of 20 years, with the option to renew for another 20 years.\n- Foreign companies can buy property in South Korea, but they must have a Korean-registered company and obtain the necessary permits.\n- Foreigners who buy property in South Korea must also comply with the country's tax laws and regulations.\n\n[SECTION] Buying Process [/SECTION]\n1.
