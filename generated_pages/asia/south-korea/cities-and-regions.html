        <h2>How South Korea Is Divided</h2>
        <p>South Korea is divided into 17 administrative divisions, which include six metropolitan cities (Seoul, Busan, Daegu, Incheon, Gwangju, and Ulsan), one special city (Sejong), and 10 provinces (Gyeonggi, Gangwon, North Chungcheong, South Chungcheong, North Jeolla, South Jeolla, North Gyeongsang, South Gyeongsang, and Jeju).
