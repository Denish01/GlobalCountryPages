[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of South Korea is designed to provide a system of **checks and balances** among the three branches, ensuring that no single branch has too much power. The **executive branch**, headed by the President, is responsible for enforcing laws and serving as the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. The **legislative branch**, composed of the unicameral National Assembly, is responsible for making laws, while the **judicial branch**, composed of the Supreme Court and lower courts, is responsible for interpreting laws. This system is designed to prevent any one branch from dominating the others, providing a balance of power and protecting the rights of citizens.

The **separation of powers** is a key feature of South Korea's political system, ensuring that each branch has distinct responsibilities and limiting the potential for abuse of power. The **unitary** nature of the government means that the central government has significant authority, with power concentrated in the national government rather than being divided among regional or local governments. This allows for a more streamlined decision-making process and enables the government to respond quickly to national issues.

The government of South Korea is also characterized by a strong **presidential system**, in which the President serves as both the head of state and the head of government. This provides a clear leadership structure and allows the President to play a key role in shaping national policy. However, the system also includes **checks and balances** to prevent the President from abusing power, such as the ability of the National Assembly to impeach the President and the independence of the judiciary.
