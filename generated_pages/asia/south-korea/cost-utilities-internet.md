[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
South Korea has a well-developed utility infrastructure, with a high level of reliability and efficiency. The country's utility costs are generally stable, with minimal fluctuations throughout the year. However, there can be some seasonal variation, with higher electricity costs during the summer months due to increased air conditioning usage and higher gas costs during the winter months due to increased heating demand. The cost of utilities in South Korea is also affected by the country's high standard of living and strong economy, with a GDP per capita PPP of $61,051.

The South Korean government has implemented various measures to reduce energy consumption and promote energy efficiency, such as the introduction of smart grids and renewable energy sources. Additionally, the country has a well-developed public transportation system, which reduces the need for personal vehicles and subsequent fuel costs. As a result, the overall utility costs in South Korea are relatively high compared to other countries, but the quality of service is also very high.
