[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]
The linguistic landscape of South Korea is dominated by the Korean language, which is spoken by the vast majority of the population. There are several regional dialects, including the Seoul dialect, which is considered the standard dialect and is widely used in media and education. Other dialects, such as the Jeju dialect spoken on Jeju Island, are also unique and distinct. While Korean is the primary language, English is widely taught in schools and is becoming increasingly popular, particularly among the younger population. However, English proficiency is still moderate, and not everyone speaks English fluently, especially among older Koreans.

Korean is a language with its own unique script, known as **Hangul**, which consists of 14 consonants and 10 vowels. The language is also characterized by a complex system of honorifics, which are used to show respect to others based on their social status, age, and relationship. This system can be challenging for foreigners to learn, but it is an important aspect of Korean culture and communication. In addition to Korean, there are also minority languages spoken in South Korea, including Chinese and Japanese, which are spoken by immigrant communities.

Despite the challenges of learning Korean, many Koreans are eager to practice their English skills with foreigners, and English is widely used in tourist areas, restaurants, and shops. However, it is still a good idea for visitors to learn some basic Korean phrases, such as greetings and directions, to help navigate the country and interact with locals.
