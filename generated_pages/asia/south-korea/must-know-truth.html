        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>South Korea, officially known as the Republic of Korea, has a rich and complex history that spans over 4,000 years. The <strong>Gojoseon</strong> kingdom, established in 2333 BCE, is considered the first Korean state. The <strong>Three Kingdoms period</strong>, which lasted from 57 BCE to 668 CE, saw the rise of the Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla kingdoms, each with their own distinct culture and traditions. In 668 CE, the Silla kingdom, with the help of the <strong>Tang Dynasty</strong> of China, unified the three kingdoms under one rule.</p>
        <p>The <strong>Goryeo Dynasty</strong>, which ruled from 918 to 1392, is from which the name "Korea" is derived. This period saw the introduction of <strong>Buddhism</strong> and the development of a unique Korean culture. The <strong>Joseon Dynasty</strong>, which lasted from 1392 to 1910, is considered one of the most important periods in Korean history, during which the Korean writing system, <strong>Hangul</strong>, was created. In 1910, Korea was annexed by Japan, and it remained under Japanese rule until the end of World War II in 1945.</p>
        <p>After Japan's defeat, the <strong>United Nations</strong> divided the Korean Peninsula into two zones, with the Soviet Union controlling the north and the United States controlling the south. In 1948, separate governments were established in each zone, leading to the creation of the Republic of Korea (South Korea) and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea). The <strong>Korean War</strong>, which lasted from 1950 to 1953, saw the two countries engage in a devastating conflict that resulted in the loss of millions of lives and the destruction of much of the country.</p>
        <p>Since the end of the Korean War, South Korea has experienced rapid economic growth and industrialization, transforming itself into one of the world's leading economies. Today, South Korea is a <strong>sovereign state</strong> with a population of over 51 million people, a distinct culture, and a strong economy.</p>
