[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
South Korea's education system is highly regarded for its quality and competitiveness, with a strong emphasis on **science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)** fields. The country has a well-developed public education system, which provides free or subsidized education to students from primary to secondary levels, with a focus on Korean language and culture. However, the quality of public education can vary depending on the region and school, with some public schools in urban areas being more competitive and prestigious than others. In contrast, private education in South Korea is highly sought after, particularly among affluent families, and is known for its high quality and rigorous academic standards.

The Korean education system consists of 12 years of compulsory education, including six years of primary education, three years of middle school, and three years of high school. The language of instruction is primarily Korean, but English is also widely taught as a second language. International schools are also available in major cities like Seoul, offering a range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate (IB) and the American curriculum. These schools cater to the children of expatriates and international families, providing a global education experience.
