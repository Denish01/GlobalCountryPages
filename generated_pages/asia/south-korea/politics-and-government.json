  "content": "South Korea is governed as a **unitary presidential constitutional republic**, with a system that divides power among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nGovernment Type: Unitary Presidential Constitutional Republic\nHead of State: President Yoon Suk-yeol\nHead of Government: President Yoon Suk-yeol\nLegislature: National Assembly, unicameral, 300 seats\nLegal System: Civil law with elements of common law\nPolitical Stability Index: Ranked 23rd out of 180 countries in the 2022 Global Peace Index\nCorruption Index: Ranked 32nd out of 180 countries in the 2022 Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]\nThe government of South Korea is designed to provide a system of **checks and balances** among the three branches, ensuring that no single branch has too much power. The **executive branch**, headed by the President, is responsible for enforcing laws and serving as the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. The **legislative branch**, composed of the unicameral National Assembly, is responsible for making laws, while the **judicial branch**, composed of the Supreme Court and lower courts, is responsible for interpreting laws. This system is designed to prevent any one branch from dominating the others, providing a balance of power and protecting the rights of citizens.\n\nThe **separation of powers** is a key feature of South Korea's political system, ensuring that each branch has distinct responsibilities and limiting the potential for abuse of power. The **unitary** nature of the government means that the central government has significant authority, with power concentrated in the national government rather than being divided among regional or local governments. This allows for a more streamlined decision-making process and enables the government to respond quickly to national issues.\n\nThe government of South Korea is also characterized by a strong **presidential system**, in which the President serves as both the head of state and the head of government. This provides a clear leadership structure and allows the President to play a key role in shaping national policy. However, the system also includes **checks and balances** to prevent the President from abusing power, such as the ability of the National Assembly to impeach the President and the independence of the judiciary.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | Office of the President | President Yoon Suk-yeol | Head of state and government, commander-in-chief |\n| Legislative | National Assembly | Speaker Kim Jin-pyo | Lawmaking, budget approval, oversight |\n| Judicial | Supreme Court | Chief Justice Kim Myeong-soo | Interpretation of laws, judicial review |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Major Political Parties [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Party | Position | Leader | Seats | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Democratic Party of Korea | Center-left | Lee Jae-myung | 169 | Largest party in the National Assembly |\n| People Power Party | Center-right | Lee Jun-seok | 111 | Main opposition party |\n| Justice Party | Progressive | Lee Jeong-mi | 6 | Advocates for social justice and human rights |\n| Open Democratic Party | Center-left | Lee Keun-shik | 3 | Focuses on social welfare and labor issues |\n| Basic Income Party | Progressive | Shin Ji-hye | 1 | Advocates for universal basic income and social welfare |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Elections [/SECTION]\n- The electoral system in South Korea is based on a **single-member district plurality** system, in which voters choose a single representative for their district.\n- Elections for the National Assembly are held every four years, with the most recent election taking place in 2020.\n- The **presidential election** is held every five years, with the most recent election taking place in 2022.\n- Voter participation in South Korea is generally high, with a turnout of over 75% in recent elections.\n\n[SECTION] Political Stability & Challenges [/SECTION]\n- The current political climate in South Korea is characterized by a **high level of polarization**, with significant divisions between the ruling and opposition parties.\n- Key issues facing the government include **economic inequality**, **unemployment**, and **corruption**.\n- Regional dynamics, particularly the relationship with **North Korea**, remain a significant challenge for the government.\n- South Korea ranks **23rd out of 180 countries** in the 2022 Global Peace Index, indicating a relatively stable and peaceful society.\n- The country also ranks **32nd out of 180 countries** in the 2022 Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index, indicating a moderate level of corruption.\n- The government faces challenges in balancing **economic growth** with **social welfare** and **environmental protection**.\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Relations [/SECTION]\n- South Korea is a member of the **United Nations** and participates in various international organizations, including the **G20** and the **OECD**.\n- The country has a **long-standing alliance** with the **United States**, which provides a significant portion of its military defense.\n- South Korea also has a **complex relationship** with **North Korea**, with which it is still technically at war.\n- The government has sought to strengthen ties with **China** and **Japan**, while also maintaining a strong relationship with the **European Union**.\n- South Korea is a key player in regional organizations, including the **Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)** and the **Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)**.",
