[SECTION] Overview: South Korea vs China [/SECTION]
South Korea and China are two neighboring countries in East Asia with distinct economic profiles. South Korea is a high-income economy with a strong focus on technology and innovation, while China is a large and diverse economy with a mix of state-owned and private enterprises. The cost of living in South Korea is generally higher than in China, due to factors such as higher labor costs, stricter regulations, and a stronger currency. However, China's cost of living can vary significantly depending on the region, with major cities like Shanghai and Beijing tend to be more expensive than smaller cities and rural areas.

The economic context of the two countries also plays a role in shaping their cost of living. South Korea has a highly developed economy with a strong social safety net, which contributes to its higher cost of living. China, on the other hand, has a large and growing economy, but its cost of living is influenced by factors such as government subsidies, price controls, and a large pool of low-cost labor. Overall, China is generally cheaper than South Korea, with a difference of around 20-30% in overall cost of living. However, the cost of living in China can vary significantly depending on the region, lifestyle, and personal preferences.
