[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
South Korea has a universal healthcare system that provides comprehensive coverage to all citizens, including foreigners with a valid residence visa. The system is primarily funded through premiums paid by individuals and employers, as well as government subsidies. Public healthcare facilities in South Korea are generally well-equipped and staffed with skilled medical professionals, although wait times can be long and the quality of care may vary depending on the location. Private healthcare facilities, on the other hand, offer higher-quality care and shorter wait times, but at a significantly higher cost. For foreigners, it is recommended to have health insurance that covers them in South Korea, as medical bills can be expensive and payment is often expected upfront.
