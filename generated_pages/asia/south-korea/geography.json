The country shares a land border with North Korea to the north, while Japan lies to the southeast across the Korea Strait, and China is situated to the northwest across the Yellow Sea. The Korean Peninsula is a mountainous region, with South Korea covering the southern portion of the peninsula. The country's unique location has played a significant role in shaping its history, culture, and economy.\n\nThe country's borders are marked by a demilitarized zone (DMZ) to the north, which separates South Korea from North Korea. The DMZ is a buffer zone that was established in 1953 as part of the Armistice Agreement, and it remains one of the most heavily militarized borders in the world. To the east, South Korea's coastline along the Pacific Ocean provides access to major ports and trade routes, while the Yellow Sea to the west is an important fishing ground and shipping lane. The country's strategic location has made it an important hub for international trade and commerce.\n\n[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]\nSouth Korea's terrain is characterized by mountains, hills, and coastal plains. The **Taebaek Mountains** run along the eastern coast, forming a rugged landscape with steep slopes and scenic valleys. The highest peak, **Hallasan**, is located on Jeju Island, a popular tourist destination off the southern coast. The mountains are covered with dense forests, including deciduous and evergreen trees, and are home to a wide range of flora and fauna. The country's mountainous terrain has made it difficult to develop large-scale agriculture, but it has also created a unique landscape with many opportunities for outdoor recreation.\n\nThe western coast of South Korea is characterized by a flat, low-lying plain, known as the **Honam Plain**, which is one of the country's most fertile regions. The plain is home to many of the country's major cities, including Seoul, and is an important center for agriculture and industry. The country's coastline is marked by many **islands**, including Jeju Island, which is a popular tourist destination known for its natural beauty and unique culture. The islands are home to many **beaches**, **coves**, and **fjords**, which provide a habitat for a wide range of marine life.\n\nIn addition to its mountains and coastal plains, South Korea is also home to many **rivers**, including the **Han River**, which flows through the capital city of Seoul. The rivers are an important source of water and have played a significant role in shaping the country's history and culture. Many of the rivers are also home to a wide range of **wetlands**, which provide a habitat for many species of birds, fish, and other wildlife.\n\n[SECTION] Climate By Season [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Season | Months | Temperature Range | Rainfall | Conditions |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Spring | March to May | 10-20°C | Moderate | Mild, with cherry blossoms blooming |\n| Summer | June to August | 25-30°C | High | Hot, humid, with heavy rainfall |\n| Autumn | September to November | 10-20°C | Moderate | Cool, with fall foliage |\n| Winter | December to February | -5 to 5°C | Low | Cold, with occasional snowfall |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Time To Visit [/SECTION]\n[CALLOUT] Best months: September to November and March to May.
