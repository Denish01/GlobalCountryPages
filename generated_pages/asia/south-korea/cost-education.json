The country has a well-developed public education system, which provides free or subsidized education to students from primary to secondary levels, with a focus on Korean language and culture. However, the quality of public education can vary depending on the region and school, with some public schools in urban areas being more competitive and prestigious than others. In contrast, private education in South Korea is highly sought after, particularly among affluent families, and is known for its high quality and rigorous academic standards.\n\nThe Korean education system consists of 12 years of compulsory education, including six years of primary education, three years of middle school, and three years of high school. The language of instruction is primarily Korean, but English is also widely taught as a second language. International schools are also available in major cities like Seoul, offering a range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate (IB) and the American curriculum. These schools cater to the children of expatriates and international families, providing a global education experience.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 - $100 | Free or subsidized, with a focus on Korean language and culture |\n| Private Primary | $2,000 - $5,000 | Range by tier, with top-tier schools offering high-quality facilities and instruction |\n| Public Secondary | $0 - $200 | Free or subsidized, with a focus on college preparation and STEM fields |\n| Private Secondary | $3,000 - $8,000 | Range by tier, with top-tier schools offering advanced courses and extracurricular activities |\n| International School | $8,000 - $20,000 | Curriculum types include IB, American, and British, with fees varying depending on the school and location |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $2,000 - $4,000 | $5,000 - $8,000 | Seoul National University and Korea University are top-ranked public universities |\n| Private University | $4,000 - $8,000 | $8,000 - $12,000 | Yonsei University and Ewha Womans University are top-ranked private universities |\n| Top-Ranked University | $5,000 - $10,000 | $10,000 - $20,000 | Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) is a top-ranked university for STEM fields |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $200 - $500 | Varies depending on location and quality of care |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $20 - $50 | Popular among students preparing for college entrance exams |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $100 - $300 | Korean language courses for foreigners are widely available |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $100 - $300 | Uniforms, textbooks, and other materials can add up |\n| School Uniform | $50 - $100 | Required for most schools, with prices varying depending on the school and quality |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The **Korean education system** is highly competitive, with a strong emphasis on academics and college preparation.\n- **International schools** in Seoul and other major cities offer a range of curricula and are popular among expatriate families.\n- **Scholarship opportunities** are available for local and international students, particularly for those pursuing higher education in STEM fields.\n- **Online learning options** are becoming increasingly popular in South Korea, with many universities and institutions offering online courses and degree programs.\n- **Education quality** in South Korea is generally high, with many universities and schools ranking among the best in Asia and globally.\n- **Language support** is available for international students, with many universities offering Korean language courses and support services to help students adjust to the local culture and education system.",
