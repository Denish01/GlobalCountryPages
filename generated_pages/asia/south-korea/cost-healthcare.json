Private healthcare facilities, on the other hand, offer higher-quality care and shorter wait times, but at a significantly higher cost. For foreigners, it is recommended to have health insurance that covers them in South Korea, as medical bills can be expensive and payment is often expected upfront.\n\nThe healthcare system in South Korea is designed to provide universal access to healthcare services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescription medications.
