[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The South Korean property market is known for its high demand and limited supply, particularly in urban areas. The market has experienced a steady increase in prices over the years, with a slight slowdown in recent times due to government regulations aimed at cooling down the market. The prices in urban areas such as Seoul are significantly higher than in rural areas, with the average price per square meter in Seoul being around $4,500 USD. The market is also influenced by the country's strong economy, high standard of living, and proximity to major cities in Asia.

The current market conditions in South Korea are characterized by a mix of government intervention and market forces. The government has implemented various measures to control the market, such as increasing property taxes and tightening lending regulations. However, the demand for property remains high, driven by a growing population and a strong economy. The price trajectory of the market is expected to continue its upward trend, albeit at a slower pace.

The urban-rural divide in South Korea is significant, with urban areas offering better infrastructure, amenities, and job opportunities. The rural areas, on the other hand, offer a more relaxed pace of life and a lower cost of living. However, the rural areas are also experiencing a decline in population, which can affect the local economy and property prices.
