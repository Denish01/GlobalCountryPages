The country has experienced a slow population growth rate in recent years, primarily due to a low fertility rate. Urbanization is a dominant trend, with the majority of the population residing in urban areas, particularly in the Seoul metropolitan area. The population is expected to continue aging, with significant implications for the workforce, healthcare, and social security systems. Migration patterns are relatively limited, with a small number of foreign workers and international students contributing to the population.\n\nThe urbanization trend in South Korea is driven by economic opportunities, education, and lifestyle preferences. The Seoul metropolitan area is a major hub, accounting for nearly half of the country's population. However, other cities, such as Busan, Daegu, and Daejeon, are also experiencing growth, driven by government initiatives to promote regional development. The population is expected to continue shifting towards urban areas, with potential implications for rural communities and regional development.\n\nThe demographic challenges facing South Korea are significant, with a rapidly aging population and a low fertility rate.
