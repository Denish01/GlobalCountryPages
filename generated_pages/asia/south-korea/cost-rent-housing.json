Typical lease terms range from one to two years, with a deposit requirement of one to three months' rent. Tenant rights are protected by law, with regulations in place to prevent unfair eviction and ensure timely repairs. Compared to its regional neighbors, South Korea's housing costs are relatively high, with prices in Seoul rivaling those in major cities like Tokyo and Hong Kong. However, the country's strong economy and high standard of living contribute to its attractiveness as a destination for expats and foreigners.\n\nThe housing market in South Korea is also characterized by a unique system of **jeonse**, which involves paying a large deposit upfront in exchange for lower monthly rent payments. This system can be beneficial for tenants who can afford the initial deposit, but it can also be a significant burden for those who are not prepared. Additionally, the market is heavily influenced by government regulations and policies, which can impact the availability and affordability of housing. For example, the government has implemented measures to control rent prices and increase the supply of affordable housing, but these efforts have had limited success in addressing the underlying issues of high demand and limited supply.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $800-$1,200 | $500-$800 | small, basic accommodation |\n| 1 Bedroom | $1,000-$1,500 | $600-$1,000 | standard, furnished apartment |\n| 2 Bedroom | $1,500-$2,500 | $1,000-$1,800 | family-sized, modern amenities |\n| 3 Bedroom | $2,500-$4,000 | $1,800-$3,000 | spacious, high-end finishes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $5,000-$10,000 | prime locations, luxury apartments |\n| Suburbs | $2,000-$5,000 | residential areas, family-friendly |\n| Rural | $1,000-$2,000 | countryside, limited amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Hongdae**: a trendy neighborhood in western Seoul, known for its arts scene and nightlife, with rent ranging from $800-$1,200 per month for a one-bedroom apartment.\n- **Gangnam**: an upscale neighborhood in southern Seoul, famous for its luxury shopping and dining options, with rent ranging from $1,200-$2,000 per month for a one-bedroom apartment.\n- **Itaewon**: a cosmopolitan neighborhood in central Seoul, popular with expats and foreigners, with rent ranging from $1,000-$1,500 per month for a one-bedroom apartment.\n- **Jongno**: a historic neighborhood in central Seoul, known for its traditional architecture and cultural attractions, with rent ranging from $800-$1,200 per month for a one-bedroom apartment.\n- **Yeouido**: a financial district in western Seoul, with a range of modern apartments and amenities, with rent ranging from $1,000-$1,800 per month for a one-bedroom apartment.\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for South Korea [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods thoroughly to find the best fit for your lifestyle and budget.\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent to find apartments and negotiate prices.\n- Be prepared to pay a large deposit upfront, especially for **jeonse** apartments.\n- Carefully review the lease agreement before signing to ensure you understand the terms and conditions.\n- Consider purchasing furniture and appliances, as many apartments come unfurnished.\n- Be aware of scams and never pay a deposit without seeing the apartment in person and meeting the landlord or agent.",
