[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in South Korea is highly competitive, with a large demand for housing in urban areas, particularly in the capital city of Seoul. Typical lease terms range from one to two years, with a deposit requirement of one to three months' rent. Tenant rights are protected by law, with regulations in place to prevent unfair eviction and ensure timely repairs. Compared to its regional neighbors, South Korea's housing costs are relatively high, with prices in Seoul rivaling those in major cities like Tokyo and Hong Kong. However, the country's strong economy and high standard of living contribute to its attractiveness as a destination for expats and foreigners.

The housing market in South Korea is also characterized by a unique system of **jeonse**, which involves paying a large deposit upfront in exchange for lower monthly rent payments. This system can be beneficial for tenants who can afford the initial deposit, but it can also be a significant burden for those who are not prepared. Additionally, the market is heavily influenced by government regulations and policies, which can impact the availability and affordability of housing. For example, the government has implemented measures to control rent prices and increase the supply of affordable housing, but these efforts have had limited success in addressing the underlying issues of high demand and limited supply.
