Christmas Island is a remote territory of Australia located in the Indian Ocean, and the most common way to get there is by flying into Christmas Island Airport, also known as XCH. The airport receives direct flights from Perth, which is the main gateway to the island. You can fly to Perth from major cities around the world and then connect to Christmas Island. There are no overland entry points to the island, as it is surrounded by water and does not share a land border with any country.

If you are planning to visit Christmas Island, it is essential to book your flights well in advance, especially during the peak season, which runs from December to January.
