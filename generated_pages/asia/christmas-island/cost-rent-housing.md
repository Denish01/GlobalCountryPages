The rental market in Christmas Island is relatively small and limited, with most properties being owned by the Australian government or private landlords. Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, with a security deposit of one to two months' rent required. Tenant rights are protected under Australian law, and renters can expect to find furnished or unfurnished apartments, depending on the property.
