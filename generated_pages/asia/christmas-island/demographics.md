The population of Christmas Island has been growing steadily over the years, with a significant increase in the number of people moving to the island for work or to start new businesses. The island's economy is primarily driven by the phosphate mining industry, which has attracted a large number of workers from other parts of Australia and Asia. However, the island's remote location and limited job opportunities have also led to a significant number of people leaving the island in search of better opportunities.

The migration patterns on Christmas Island are also influenced by the island's cultural and historical ties to Australia and Asia. Many people on the island have family ties to other parts of Australia or Asia, and there is a significant amount of migration between the island and these regions.
