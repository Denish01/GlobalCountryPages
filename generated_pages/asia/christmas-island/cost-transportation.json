The main modes of transportation on the island are taxis, buses, and private vehicles. The quality of public transit is relatively good, with a reliable bus service connecting the main settlements. However, the frequency of buses can be limited, and most people get around by driving their own vehicles or using taxis. The island's small size and lack of traffic congestion make it easy to get around, but the lack of public transportation options can be a challenge for visitors.\n\nThe island's scenic roads and stunning natural beauty make driving a popular option, but visitors should be aware that driving on the left-hand side of the road is the norm, as Christmas Island is an Australian territory. The island's small size also means that walking and cycling are viable options, with many scenic trails and bike paths available. However, the hot tropical climate can make these options challenging during the peak summer months.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $2-$3 | $60-$80 | Good coverage, limited frequency |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $5-$10 | N/A | Limited routes, available on demand |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $5-$10 | $2-$3 | $10-$20 | Available at airport and main settlements |\n| Ride-Hailing App | N/A | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$30 | Available on demand, fixed price |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.50-$2.00 | Limited fuel stations available |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.30-$1.80 | Limited fuel stations available |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $80-$120 | Economy car, limited availability |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $2-$5 | Limited parking options available |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | N/A | No toll roads on the island |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus | N/A | No intercity bus services available |\n| Domestic Flight | $200-$500 | Flights to Perth, Western Australia, available from Christmas Island Airport |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | No train services available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Visitors should be aware that transportation options are limited on the island, and planning ahead is essential.\n- Renting a car can be a good option, but visitors should be aware that driving on the left-hand side of the road is the norm.\n- Taxis are available, but prices can be high, and visitors should negotiate the fare before starting the journey.\n- The island's small size means that walking and cycling are viable options, but visitors should be aware of the hot tropical climate and take necessary precautions.\n- Visitors should also be aware that fuel stations are limited, and fuel prices can be high.\n- Using a **reliable map or GPS** can help visitors navigate the island's roads and scenic trails.\n- Visitors should also be aware of the **island's speed limits** and drive safely, as the roads can be narrow and winding.",
