However, the island's eating-out culture is still vibrant, with a range of restaurants and cafes serving a mix of Australian, Asian, and seafood dishes.\n\nDespite the high costs, the island's unique cultural heritage and stunning natural beauty make it an attractive destination for tourists and expats. The local community is also passionate about food, with many residents enjoying traditional Australian barbecues and outdoor dining.
