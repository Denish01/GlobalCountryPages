[SECTION] How Christmas Island Is Divided [/SECTION]
Christmas Island is a territory of Australia and is not divided into states or provinces like the mainland. Instead, it is a single administrative unit with a shire council that governs the island. The island has a number of small settlements, each with its own unique character, but there are no formal divisions or regions. The Australian government is responsible for the island's defense and foreign affairs, while the shire council handles local matters such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure.

The island's administrative structure is relatively simple, with a focus on providing services to the local community. The shire council works closely with the Australian government to ensure that the island's needs are met, and that the island is well-integrated into the broader Australian community. This close relationship between the island and the mainland helps to ensure that Christmas Island has access to the resources and services it needs to thrive.
