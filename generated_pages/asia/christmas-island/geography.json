The island is part of the Australian external territory, along with the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Lord Howe Island. The island's strategic location allows it to serve as a stopping point for ships traveling between Australia and Asia. The surrounding waters are home to a diverse array of marine life, including coral reefs, dolphins, and whales.\n\nThe island's proximity to Indonesia means that it shares a maritime border with the country, and the two nations have a long history of cultural and economic exchange. The island's remote location, however, has also allowed it to maintain a unique cultural identity, shaped by its history as a British phosphate mining colony and its current status as an Australian territory. The island's capital, Flying Fish Cove, is the main population center and serves as the arrival point for visitors.\n\n[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]\nChristmas Island's terrain is characterized by a mix of rugged hills, valleys, and coastal plains. The island's highest point, Murray Hill, rises to an elevation of 361 meters, while the coastal plains are generally flat and narrow. The island's interior is covered in a dense rainforest, which is home to a wide variety of flora and fauna, including many endemic species. The rainforest is dominated by trees such as the **Canarium** and **Tristania**, which provide a habitat for a diverse array of birds, reptiles, and insects.\n\nThe island's coastline is marked by steep cliffs, rocky shores, and sandy beaches, with a coral reef surrounding the island. The reef is home to a diverse array of marine life, including fish, coral, and other invertebrates. The island's unique geology is also characterized by the presence of **phosphate deposits**, which were mined extensively in the past and played a significant role in the island's economy. Today, the island's natural beauty and unique biodiversity make it an attractive destination for tourists and scientists alike.\n\nThe island's terrain and landscape have also been shaped by human activity, particularly the mining of phosphate, which has left behind a legacy of **mining infrastructure** and **waste rock**. However, efforts are being made to restore the island's natural habitats and promote sustainable development. The island's national park, which covers about 63% of the island, provides a protected area for the island's unique flora and fauna to thrive.\n\n[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION] is continued to provide a detailed description of Christmas Island's terrain and landscape, which is essential to understanding the island's unique biodiversity and ecosystem. \n\n[SECTION] Climate By Season [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Season | Months | Temperature Range | Rainfall | Conditions |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Summer | December to February | 25-30°C | high | hot and humid |\n| Autumn | March to May | 22-28°C | moderate | mild and pleasant |\n| Winter | June to August | 20-25°C | low | cool and dry |\n| Spring | September to November | 22-28°C | moderate | mild and pleasant |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Time To Visit [/SECTION]\n[CALLOUT] Best months: September to November and March to May.
