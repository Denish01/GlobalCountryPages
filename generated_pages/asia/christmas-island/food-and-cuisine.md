Christmas Island's cuisine is a unique blend of Asian and Australian flavors, with a focus on fresh seafood and traditional cooking methods. The island's proximity to Indonesia and its historical ties to Australia have influenced the local cuisine, resulting in a distinct fusion of flavors and dishes. The island's small population and limited access to certain ingredients have also led to the development of creative and resourceful cooking methods. As a result, Christmas Island's cuisine is characterized by its use of local and imported ingredients, such as seafood, rice, noodles, and coconut milk.

The island's food culture is also shaped by its cultural diversity, with a mix of Chinese, Malay, and Australian influences. This diversity is reflected in the variety of dishes and cooking methods found on the island, from traditional Asian-style stir-fries and curries to modern Australian-inspired seafood dishes. Despite its small size, Christmas Island has a thriving food scene, with a range of restaurants, cafes, and markets serving up delicious and authentic local cuisine.

One of the key factors that define Christmas Island's cuisine is its emphasis on freshness and seasonality. The island's seafood is particularly renowned, with a wide range of fish, shellfish, and other seafood available throughout the year. The island's chefs make the most of this bounty, serving up dishes that showcase the freshest and best ingredients. From seafood BBQs to traditional Asian-style stir-fries, Christmas Island's cuisine is a true reflection of its unique cultural and geographical context.
