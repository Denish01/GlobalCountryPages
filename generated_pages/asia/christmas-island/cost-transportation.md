[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Christmas Island is a small territory with limited transportation options. The main modes of transportation on the island are taxis, buses, and private vehicles. The quality of public transit is relatively good, with a reliable bus service connecting the main settlements. However, the frequency of buses can be limited, and most people get around by driving their own vehicles or using taxis. The island's small size and lack of traffic congestion make it easy to get around, but the lack of public transportation options can be a challenge for visitors.

The island's scenic roads and stunning natural beauty make driving a popular option, but visitors should be aware that driving on the left-hand side of the road is the norm, as Christmas Island is an Australian territory. The island's small size also means that walking and cycling are viable options, with many scenic trails and bike paths available. However, the hot tropical climate can make these options challenging during the peak summer months.
