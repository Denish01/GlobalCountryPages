[SECTION] Cost of Living Overview [/SECTION]
Christmas Island has a relatively high cost of living, mainly due to its remote location and limited access to goods and services. The island's GDP per capita (PPP) is $44,179, indicating a high standard of living. However, the cost of living on the island is significantly higher than in neighboring Indonesia. A budget of $2,500 per month can provide a basic lifestyle, while $3,500 per month can offer a mid-range lifestyle with some comforts. A comfortable lifestyle, on the other hand, would require around $4,500 per month.

The high cost of living on Christmas Island is largely driven by the cost of transportation, food, and housing. The island's remote location means that many goods and services have to be imported, which increases their cost. Additionally, the island's small population and limited job market can make it difficult for people to find employment and afford the high cost of living. Compared to other countries in the region, Christmas Island is one of the most expensive places to live, making it challenging for people with limited budgets to afford.
