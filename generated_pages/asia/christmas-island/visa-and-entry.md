[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Christmas Island has a moderate visa policy, with citizens from certain countries eligible for visa-free access or able to obtain a visa on arrival. The island's visa policy is closely tied to that of Australia, and as such, many countries that have a visa-free arrangement with Australia also have similar arrangements with Christmas Island. Citizens from over 30 countries, including the US, UK, and many EU countries, can enter Christmas Island without a visa for tourism or business purposes, usually for a stay of up to 3 months.

The visa policy is designed to balance the need to control immigration with the need to facilitate tourism and economic development on the island. As a territory of Australia, Christmas Island's visa policy is closely aligned with that of its parent country, and visitors who require a visa for Australia will often also require a visa for Christmas Island.
