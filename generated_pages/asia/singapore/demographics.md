[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Singapore has a relatively small population, but it is one of the most densely populated countries in the world. The population has been growing steadily over the years, with a current growth rate of approximately 0.5%. This growth is largely driven by immigration, as the country's low fertility rate of 1.2 children per woman is below the replacement rate. The population is expected to continue growing, albeit at a slow rate, with estimates suggesting it will reach 6.5 million by 2030. Urbanization is a key characteristic of Singapore, with the entire population living in urban areas. The country's high population density and limited land area have led to the development of a comprehensive public housing program, which provides affordable housing for the majority of the population.

The population of Singapore is also characterized by a high level of migration, with a significant proportion of foreigners living and working in the country. This has contributed to the country's cultural diversity and has helped to drive economic growth. However, it has also raised concerns about the impact on the local population and the need for integration policies to promote social cohesion. The government has implemented various initiatives to manage migration and promote integration, including language training programs and cultural orientation courses.

Singapore's population is also aging rapidly, with a significant increase in the proportion of older citizens. This has implications for the country's healthcare system, pension schemes, and social services. The government has responded by implementing policies to support older workers, such as flexible work arrangements and retirement savings schemes. It has also invested in healthcare infrastructure and social services to support the needs of an aging population.
