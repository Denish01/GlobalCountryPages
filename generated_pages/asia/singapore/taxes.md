[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Singapore has a **territorial taxation** system, which means that only income earned in Singapore is subject to tax, regardless of the individual's or company's tax residency status. However, individuals who are considered tax residents in Singapore are also taxed on their foreign-sourced income, but they may be eligible for **foreign tax credits** to avoid double taxation. The tax residency rules in Singapore are based on the number of days an individual spends in the country, with those spending 60 days or more in a calendar year considered tax residents.

The tax system in Singapore is designed to be **business-friendly** and **competitive**, with a focus on encouraging foreign investment and entrepreneurship. The government offers various tax incentives and schemes to support businesses, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The tax authorities in Singapore, the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS), are responsible for administering the tax system and providing guidance to taxpayers.
