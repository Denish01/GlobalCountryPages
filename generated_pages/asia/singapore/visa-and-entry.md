# Singapore Visa & Entry Requirements

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Singapore before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Singapore has a relatively liberal visa policy, with citizens from over 80 countries eligible for visa-free entry. The country's strategic location and business-friendly environment make it an attractive destination for tourists, business travelers, and expatriates. The visa policy is designed to facilitate travel while ensuring national security and public safety. Singapore offers various types of visas, including tourist, business, student, and work visas, each with its own set of requirements and regulations.

The visa-free entry policy allows citizens from eligible countries to stay in Singapore for a specified period, typically up to 90 days. However, it is essential to note that visa-free entry does not guarantee automatic entry, and immigration officers may request additional documentation or information upon arrival. Singapore's visa policy is subject to change, and it is crucial to check the official government website or consult with the embassy or consulate for the latest information.

[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]
**Tourists:** Tourists can enter Singapore visa-free for up to 90 days, provided they meet the eligibility criteria. The typical stay for tourists is 3-5 days, but it can be extended for an additional 90 days with a valid reason. To extend their stay, tourists must apply for an extension at the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) office.
**Business Travelers:** Business travelers may require a visa, depending on their nationality and the purpose of their visit. They must provide an invitation letter from a registered company in Singapore, as well as proof of their business activities. Business travelers can stay in Singapore for up to 30 days, but they may need to apply for a work visa if they plan to stay longer.
**Students:** Students must apply for a student visa, which requires proof of enrollment at a registered educational institution in Singapore. The student visa is typically valid for the duration of the course, and students must meet specific requirements, such as having sufficient funds and health insurance.
**Workers:** Workers must apply for a work visa, which requires sponsorship from a registered employer in Singapore. The work visa is typically valid for 1-2 years, and workers must meet specific requirements, such as having a minimum salary and qualifications.

Travelers can also enter Singapore by land or sea through the Woodlands Checkpoint or the Tuas Checkpoint. The procedures are similar to those at the airport, but travelers may need to provide additional documentation, such as a vehicle registration certificate or a crew list.
