[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Singapore is highly competitive, with a wide range of options available to suit different budgets and preferences. Typical lease terms in Singapore are one to two years, with a one-month security deposit required for most rentals. Tenant rights are protected under the **Residential Tenancies Act**, which outlines the responsibilities of both landlords and tenants. Compared to its regional neighbors, Singapore's housing costs are relatively high, with prices comparable to those in major cities like Hong Kong and Tokyo. However, the city-state's high standard of living, excellent infrastructure, and strong economy make it an attractive destination for expats and locals alike.

The Singaporean government has implemented various measures to regulate the housing market and ensure affordability for its citizens. For example, the **Housing and Development Board (HDB)** provides subsidized public housing options for low- and middle-income families. Additionally, the government has introduced policies to curb speculation and promote stability in the private property market. Despite these efforts, housing costs in Singapore remain relatively high, with the average monthly rent for a one-bedroom apartment in the city center ranging from $3,000 to $6,000 USD.
