[SECTION] How Singapore Is Divided [/SECTION]
Singapore is a sovereign city-state with a unique administrative structure. The country is divided into 5 Community Development Councils (CDCs), which are further subdivided into 29 Constituencies. These CDCs play a crucial role in promoting community development and social cohesion. Each CDC is headed by a Mayor and has its own council, which comprises members of parliament, mayors, and other community leaders. This structure allows for effective governance and representation of the people at the local level.

The administrative divisions in Singapore are designed to facilitate efficient planning, development, and management of the city-state. The government has implemented various initiatives to promote social cohesion, economic growth, and environmental sustainability. The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) and the Housing and Development Board (HDB) are two key agencies responsible for urban planning and housing development in Singapore. They work closely with the CDCs and other government agencies to ensure that the city-state remains a vibrant, livable, and sustainable place for its citizens.
