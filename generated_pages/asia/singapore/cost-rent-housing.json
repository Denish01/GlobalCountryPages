Typical lease terms in Singapore are one to two years, with a one-month security deposit required for most rentals. Tenant rights are protected under the **Residential Tenancies Act**, which outlines the responsibilities of both landlords and tenants. Compared to its regional neighbors, Singapore's housing costs are relatively high, with prices comparable to those in major cities like Hong Kong and Tokyo. However, the city-state's high standard of living, excellent infrastructure, and strong economy make it an attractive destination for expats and locals alike.\n\nThe Singaporean government has implemented various measures to regulate the housing market and ensure affordability for its citizens. For example, the **Housing and Development Board (HDB)** provides subsidized public housing options for low- and middle-income families. Additionally, the government has introduced policies to curb speculation and promote stability in the private property market. Despite these efforts, housing costs in Singapore remain relatively high, with the average monthly rent for a one-bedroom apartment in the city center ranging from $3,000 to $6,000 USD.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $2,000-$3,500 | $1,200-$2,500 | (typical quality, 20-40 sqm) |\n| 1 Bedroom | $3,000-$6,000 | $1,500-$3,500 | (what to expect, 40-70 sqm) |\n| 2 Bedroom | $4,500-$9,000 | $2,500-$6,000 | (family size, 70-120 sqm) |\n| 3 Bedroom | $6,000-$15,000 | $3,500-$9,000 | (spacious, 120-200 sqm) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $1,500-$3,000 | (prime locations, e.g. Marina Bay, Orchard) |\n| Suburbs | $800-$2,000 | (residential areas, e.g. Tiong Bahru, Katong) |\n| Rural | N/A | (not applicable, as Singapore is a highly urbanized city-state) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Orchard Road**: a popular area for shopping and entertainment, with typical rent ranging from $3,000 to $6,000 USD per month for a one-bedroom apartment.\n- **Tiong Bahru**: a trendy neighborhood with a mix of old and new buildings, offering a range of rental options from $2,000 to $4,000 USD per month.\n- **Marina Bay**: a prime location with stunning views of the city, with typical rent ranging from $4,000 to $10,000 USD per month for a one-bedroom apartment.\n- **Katong**: a family-friendly area with a mix of old and new housing, offering rental options from $2,500 to $5,000 USD per month.\n- **River Valley**: a scenic area with a mix of high-rise and low-rise buildings, offering rental options from $2,500 to $5,000 USD per month.\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Singapore [/SECTION]\n- Start your housing search early, as the rental market in Singapore can be highly competitive.\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent to find a suitable apartment, as they often have access to a wide range of listings.\n- Be prepared to negotiate the rent and terms of the lease, as this is a common practice in Singapore.\n- Be aware of scams and ensure that you are dealing with a legitimate landlord or agent.\n- Check if utilities such as water and electricity are included in the rent, as this can vary depending on the landlord and property.\n- Consider renting a **furnished** apartment, as this is a common option in Singapore and can save you money on setup costs.",
