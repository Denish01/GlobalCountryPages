English is the primary language used for business, education, and government, and it is widely understood and spoken by the majority of the population. Malay, Mandarin, and Tamil are also official languages, and they are spoken by the respective ethnic groups. Regional dialects, such as Hokkien, Cantonese, and Teochew, are also commonly spoken, particularly among the older generation. Minority languages, such as Punjabi and Bengali, are spoken by smaller ethnic groups. Overall, Singapore's language policy promotes multilingualism and bilingualism, with English as the common language that binds the different ethnic groups together.\n\nThe widespread use of English in Singapore makes it easy for tourists and visitors to communicate and navigate the city-state. Most signs, menus, and public announcements are in English, and many Singaporeans are proficient in English, making it the primary language used for communication. However, it is still possible to encounter other languages and dialects, particularly in ethnic neighborhoods and among older Singaporeans.\n\nSingapore's language policy has contributed to the country's economic success and cultural diversity. The bilingual policy, which promotes the use of English and one other language, has enabled Singaporeans to communicate effectively with people from different cultural backgrounds and to access a wide range of educational and economic opportunities. The policy has also helped to promote social cohesion and national identity, by recognizing and respecting the different languages and cultures of the various ethnic groups.\n\n[SECTION] Essential Phrases [/SECTION]\n| English | Local Language | Pronunciation | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hello | Hello (English), Selamat pagi (Malay), (Mandarin), Vanakkam (Tamil) | Heh-lo, Seh-la-mat pah-gee, nǐ hǎo, Vah-nah-kahm | formal/informal |\n| Thank you | Thank you (English), Terima kasih (Malay), (Mandarin), Nandri (Tamil) | Than-kyou, Teh-ree-mah kah-seh, xiè xiè, Nahn-dree |  |\n| Please | Please (English), Sila (Malay), (Mandarin), Please (Tamil) | Pleez, See-lah, qǐng, Pleez |  |\n| Yes / No | Yes / No (English), Ya / Tidak (Malay), / (Mandarin), Ammu / Illai (Tamil) | Yehs / No, Yah / Tee-dahk, shì / bù, Ahm-moo / Ee-lie |  |\n| Excuse me | Excuse me (English), Maaf (Malay), (Mandarin), Mannikki (Tamil) | Ex-kyooz mee, Mah-ahf, duì bù qǐ, Mahn-nee-kee |  |\n| How much? | How much?
