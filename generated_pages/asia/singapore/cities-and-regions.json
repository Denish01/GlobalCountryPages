This structure allows for effective governance and representation of the people at the local level.\n\nThe administrative divisions in Singapore are designed to facilitate efficient planning, development, and management of the city-state. The government has implemented various initiatives to promote social cohesion, economic growth, and environmental sustainability. The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) and the Housing and Development Board (HDB) are two key agencies responsible for urban planning and housing development in Singapore. They work closely with the CDCs and other government agencies to ensure that the city-state remains a vibrant, livable, and sustainable place for its citizens.\n\n[SECTION] Major Cities [/SECTION]\n**Singapore** (5.690M)\nRole: Capital, economic hub, cultural center, port city\nKnown For: Its vibrant multicultural heritage, world-class infrastructure, and stunning architecture.
