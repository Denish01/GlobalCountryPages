The quality of public transit in Singapore is high, with modern and clean vehicles, and a reliable schedule. Most people in Singapore get around using the public transportation system, which includes buses and trains, as it is convenient and affordable. The city-state's small size and grid-like road network also make it easy to navigate, with many people choosing to walk or cycle for short distances.\n\nThe public transportation system in Singapore is also integrated, with a single card, known as the EZ-Link card, that can be used to pay for fares on buses and trains. This makes it easy for commuters to switch between different modes of transport, and also provides a convenient way to pay for fares. In addition, the city-state has a number of taxi companies and ride-hailing services, such as Grab and Gojek, which provide an alternative mode of transport for those who prefer a more personalized service.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $1.40 | $130 | Extensive coverage, frequent services |\n| Metro / Subway | $1.40 | $130 | Modern and efficient, 6 lines |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $2.50 | N/A | Limited routes, peak hour services |\n| Commuter Train | $1.40-2.50 | $130 | Limited services, mostly peak hours |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $3.20 | $0.60 | $10-15 | Available at taxi stands and on streets |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $2.50 | $0.50 | $8-12 | Grab and Gojek available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-30 | To city center, depending on traffic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $2.10 | 95 octane |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.80 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $60-100 | Economy car, depending on rental company |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $2-5 | Limited parking spaces, fees vary |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $2-5 | Electronic payment system, fees vary |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $20-40 | To neighboring cities in Malaysia |\n| Domestic Flight | $50-100 | Limited routes, mostly to neighboring islands |\n| Train (long-distance) | $50-100 | Limited services, mostly to neighboring countries |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transport, consider purchasing a monthly transit pass, which can be used on buses and trains.\n- Use the EZ-Link card to pay for fares on public transportation, as it is convenient and easy to use.\n- Download the Grab or Gojek app to book a ride-hailing service, which can be more convenient than hailing a taxi on the street.\n- Be aware of peak hour surcharges when using ride-hailing services, which can increase the cost of a ride.\n- Consider walking or cycling for short distances, as Singapore is a relatively small city-state with a grid-like road network.\n- Always use a licensed taxi or ride-hailing service, and agree on the fare before starting the journey to avoid any disputes.",
