The airport is connected to over 200 destinations worldwide, including direct flights to major cities in Europe, North America, Australia, and Asia. If you prefer to enter Singapore by land, you can cross the border from Malaysia via the Causeway or the Second Link, with bus and taxi services available from Johor Bahru. Alternatively, you can also take a ferry from Indonesia's Batam or Bintan islands to Singapore's Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal.\n\nFor those traveling from neighboring countries, overland entry points are convenient options. The Causeway, which connects Singapore to Johor Bahru, Malaysia, is a popular route, with 24-hour bus and taxi services available. Additionally, the Second Link, which connects Singapore to Malaysia's Gelang Patah, is another option for travelers. It is essential to note that visa requirements and customs regulations apply to overland entry points, so it is crucial to check the requirements before entering Singapore.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nSingapore has a limited domestic air network, with only a few flights connecting the city-state to nearby islands. The main domestic airline is SilkAir, a subsidiary of Singapore Airlines, which operates flights to several destinations, including Pulau Tioman in Malaysia. However, due to the small size of the country, domestic flights are not a popular mode of transportation, and most travelers prefer to use the efficient public transportation system or taxis to get around. Booking domestic flights can be done online or through a travel agent, with approximate costs ranging from SGD 100 to SGD 300 (USD 75 to USD 225) for a one-way ticket.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nSingapore has an extensive rail network, with the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system being the backbone of the public transportation system.

The MRT operates from 5:30 am to 12:30 am, with frequencies ranging from 2 to 10 minutes, depending on the time of day and the line.

You can use the TransitLink website or mobile app to plan your journey and book tickets in advance. The EZ-Link card can also be used to pay for bus fares.
