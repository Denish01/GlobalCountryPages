The cost of utilities in Singapore is generally stable, with minimal fluctuation throughout the year. However, there may be some seasonal variation in electricity and water consumption, with higher usage during the hotter summer months. The Public Utilities Board (PUB) and the Energy Market Authority (EMA) are the main regulatory bodies responsible for overseeing the utility sector in Singapore.\n\nThe cost of utilities in Singapore is influenced by various factors, including the size of the apartment, the number of occupants, and the level of consumption. The use of air conditioning, which is a common feature in Singapore's tropical climate, can significantly impact electricity bills. Additionally, the cost of water is relatively high in Singapore, due to the country's limited natural resources and the need to rely on desalination and water recycling.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $80-$120 | $120-$180 | $180-$250 | |\n| Water | $20-$30 | $30-$40 | $40-$50 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $10-$20 | $10-$20 | $10-$20 | |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10-$20 | $10-$20 | $10-$20 | (included in rent or separately billed) |\n| **Total** | **$140-$220** | **$220-$320** | **$320-$440** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $30-$50 | 100-500 Mbps | Singtel, StarHub, M1 |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $60-$100 | 1-10 Gbps | Singtel, StarHub, M1 |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-$30 | 1-10 GB | Singtel, StarHub, M1 |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-$50 | 10-50 GB | Singtel, StarHub, M1 |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $50-$150 | varies | Singtel, StarHub, M1 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5-$10 | (e.g. meWatch, HOOQ) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Singapore, residents typically need to contact the relevant service providers (e.g. SP Group for electricity and water) and provide identification and proof of address.\n- Prepaid electricity options are available in Singapore, but postpaid plans are more common and often more convenient.\n- When choosing an internet service provider, consider factors such as speed, data allowance, and customer support.\n- To save on utility bills, residents can take steps such as using energy-efficient appliances, reducing water consumption, and opting for **green tariffs** that support renewable energy. \n- Additionally, residents can also consider **time-of-use pricing** plans, which charge lower rates for electricity used during off-peak hours, to further reduce their utility bills.",
