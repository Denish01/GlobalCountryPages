[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Singapore is situated near the equator and has a tropical rainforest climate, with no distinct seasons. The country experiences a relatively constant temperature throughout the year, with average temperatures ranging from 23 to 33 degrees Celsius. The climate is characterized by high humidity and abundant rainfall, with two main monsoon seasons: the Northeast Monsoon from December to March and the Southwest Monsoon from June to September. The monsoon seasons bring heavy rainfall and strong winds, making it less ideal for outdoor activities. However, the rain showers are usually short and followed by sunshine, making it possible to still enjoy the city-state's attractions.

The dry season, which falls in the months of February to August, is the best time to visit Singapore, with less rainfall and more sunshine. This period is ideal for outdoor activities such as visiting the Gardens by the Bay, exploring the MacRitchie Reservoir Park, or taking a stroll along the Marina Bay Waterfront. The dry season is also the peak tourist season, with schools on summer break and families on vacation, making it a great time to enjoy the city's theme parks, such as Universal Studios Singapore and Adventure Cove Waterpark.

The monsoon seasons, on the other hand, can be a challenge for travelers, with heavy rainfall and flash floods possible. However, the monsoon seasons also bring a unique charm to the city, with the rain washing away the dust and grime, and the lush greenery thriving in the wet conditions. Visitors can still enjoy the city's indoor attractions, such as the National Gallery Singapore, the Singapore Art Museum, and the various shopping malls, during the monsoon seasons.
