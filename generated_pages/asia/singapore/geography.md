[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Singapore is an island city-state located in Southeast Asia, situated at the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula. The country is bordered by Malaysia to the north and Indonesia's Riau Islands to the south. It is also surrounded by the Singapore Strait to the south, the South China Sea to the east, and the Malacca Strait to the west. This strategic location has made Singapore an important hub for trade and commerce in the region.

The country's borders with Malaysia are marked by a combination of natural and artificial boundaries, including the Johor-Singapore Causeway, which connects the two countries. The border with Indonesia is entirely maritime, with the two countries separated by the Singapore Strait. Singapore's unique location has allowed it to develop a distinct culture and identity, shaped by its history, geography, and cultural influences from its neighboring countries.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Singapore's terrain is generally flat, with no significant mountains or hills. The highest point, Bukit Timah, is a relatively small hill that stands at 163.63 meters above sea level. The country's landscape is dominated by low-lying plains, with many areas being reclaimed from the sea over the years. The western part of the island is home to a series of reservoirs and water catchment areas, which provide a significant portion of the country's freshwater supply.

The eastern part of the island is characterized by a mix of sandy beaches, mangrove forests, and rocky shores. The coastline is generally rocky, with many small islands and islets scattered off the coast. The southern part of the island is home to a number of **nature reserves**, including the **Bukit Timah Nature Reserve** and the **Central Catchment Nature Reserve**, which provide a habitat for a wide range of flora and fauna. The urban landscape of Singapore is characterized by a mix of high-rise buildings, gardens, and parks, with a strong emphasis on green spaces and urban planning.
