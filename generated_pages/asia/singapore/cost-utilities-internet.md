[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Singapore has a well-developed utility infrastructure, with a high level of reliability and efficiency. The cost of utilities in Singapore is generally stable, with minimal fluctuation throughout the year. However, there may be some seasonal variation in electricity and water consumption, with higher usage during the hotter summer months. The Public Utilities Board (PUB) and the Energy Market Authority (EMA) are the main regulatory bodies responsible for overseeing the utility sector in Singapore.

The cost of utilities in Singapore is influenced by various factors, including the size of the apartment, the number of occupants, and the level of consumption. The use of air conditioning, which is a common feature in Singapore's tropical climate, can significantly impact electricity bills. Additionally, the cost of water is relatively high in Singapore, due to the country's limited natural resources and the need to rely on desalination and water recycling.
