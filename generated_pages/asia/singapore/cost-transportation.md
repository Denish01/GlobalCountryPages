[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Singapore has a well-developed and efficient public transportation system, with a comprehensive network of buses and trains that cover most areas of the city-state. The quality of public transit in Singapore is high, with modern and clean vehicles, and a reliable schedule. Most people in Singapore get around using the public transportation system, which includes buses and trains, as it is convenient and affordable. The city-state's small size and grid-like road network also make it easy to navigate, with many people choosing to walk or cycle for short distances.

The public transportation system in Singapore is also integrated, with a single card, known as the EZ-Link card, that can be used to pay for fares on buses and trains. This makes it easy for commuters to switch between different modes of transport, and also provides a convenient way to pay for fares. In addition, the city-state has a number of taxi companies and ride-hailing services, such as Grab and Gojek, which provide an alternative mode of transport for those who prefer a more personalized service.
