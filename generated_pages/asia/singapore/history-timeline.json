The island's strategic location at the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula made it an attractive spot for trade and commerce. In the 16th century, Singapore was part of the **Malay Kingdom of Johor**, and later, it was colonized by the **British** in 1819. The British established Singapore as a free trade port, which led to rapid economic growth and immigration from various parts of the world. During World War II, Singapore was occupied by **Japan**, and after the war, the island began to move towards independence. In 1963, Singapore joined **Malaysia**, but it was expelled from the federation two years later and became an independent country. Since then, Singapore has developed into a modern, prosperous nation with a strong economy and a high standard of living.\n\nThe pre-colonial period in Singapore was marked by the presence of various ethnic groups, including the **Malays**, **Chinese**, and **Indians**. The island's early history was also influenced by the **Srivijaya Empire**, which was a powerful trading empire that dominated the region from the 7th to the 13th centuries. The colonial period, which lasted from 1819 to 1942, saw the establishment of Singapore as a major trading center and the development of its infrastructure, including the construction of roads, bridges, and buildings. The post-war period was marked by the country's struggle for independence and its subsequent development into a modern nation.\n\nThe modern era in Singapore has been characterized by rapid economic growth, urbanization, and technological advancements. The country has become a major financial center and a hub for international trade and commerce. The government has implemented various policies to promote economic development, including the establishment of free trade agreements and the development of **special economic zones**. Singapore has also become a popular tourist destination, with over 14 million visitors per year.\n\nThe country's history has been shaped by the interactions of various ethnic groups and the influence of external powers.
