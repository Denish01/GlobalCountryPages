[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Hong Kong's population size is significant, given its relatively small land area, resulting in one of the highest population densities in the world. The population growth rate has been steadily declining over the years, with a current rate of 0.4%, which is largely attributed to a low fertility rate and an aging population. Urbanization is widespread, with the entire population residing in urban areas, and the majority living in high-rise apartments. Migration patterns in Hong Kong are characterized by a significant influx of immigrants from mainland China, as well as a large expatriate community. The population is also experiencing a shift towards an aging population, with significant implications for the workforce, healthcare, and social security systems.

The population of Hong Kong is also characterized by a high life expectancy, with an average lifespan of 85.3 years, which is one of the highest in the world. This is largely due to the region's high standard of living, access to quality healthcare, and a strong emphasis on education and health. However, the low fertility rate of 1.07 children per woman poses significant challenges for the region's future population growth and sustainability.

The government of Hong Kong has implemented various policies to address the challenges posed by the population's demographic trends, including measures to increase the fertility rate, support the elderly, and promote immigration. These efforts aim to ensure the long-term sustainability of the region's population and economy.
