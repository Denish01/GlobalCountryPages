[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Hong Kong's utility infrastructure is well-developed, with a reliable supply of electricity, water, and gas. The costs of utilities in Hong Kong are generally stable, with some seasonal variation in electricity and gas consumption. During the summer months, electricity consumption tends to increase due to the use of air conditioning, while in the winter months, gas consumption may increase for heating. The overall cost of utilities is also influenced by the inflation rate, which was 1.7% in 2024, and the GDP per capita PPP, which was $75,196 in 2024.

The quality of utility services in Hong Kong is high, with a wide range of providers offering competitive pricing and reliable services. However, the cost of utilities can vary depending on the location, size, and type of accommodation. For example, apartments in the city center tend to be more expensive than those in the suburbs. Additionally, the cost of utilities can be affected by the type of building and its age, with newer buildings often having more energy-efficient systems.
