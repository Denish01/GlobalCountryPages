  "content": "The population of Hong Kong is comprised of approximately 7.5 million people, with a diverse mix of ethnic groups, languages, and religions, making it a unique and culturally rich special administrative region.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nTotal Population: 7.5 million\nPopulation Growth Rate: 0.4%\nMedian Age: 43.4 years\nUrban Population: 100%\nPopulation Density: 6,777 per km2\nLife Expectancy: 85.3 years\nFertility Rate: 1.07 children per woman\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]\nHong Kong's population size is significant, given its relatively small land area, resulting in one of the highest population densities in the world. The population growth rate has been steadily declining over the years, with a current rate of 0.4%, which is largely attributed to a low fertility rate and an aging population. Urbanization is widespread, with the entire population residing in urban areas, and the majority living in high-rise apartments. Migration patterns in Hong Kong are characterized by a significant influx of immigrants from mainland China, as well as a large expatriate community. The population is also experiencing a shift towards an aging population, with significant implications for the workforce, healthcare, and social security systems.\n\nThe population of Hong Kong is also characterized by a high life expectancy, with an average lifespan of 85.3 years, which is one of the highest in the world. This is largely due to the region's high standard of living, access to quality healthcare, and a strong emphasis on education and health. However, the low fertility rate of 1.07 children per woman poses significant challenges for the region's future population growth and sustainability.\n\nThe government of Hong Kong has implemented various policies to address the challenges posed by the population's demographic trends, including measures to increase the fertility rate, support the elderly, and promote immigration. These efforts aim to ensure the long-term sustainability of the region's population and economy.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Chinese | 92% | Mainland China, Hong Kong | Predominant ethnic group |\n| Filipino | 2.7% | Philippines | Significant expatriate community |\n| Indonesian | 1.9% | Indonesia | Large domestic helper population |\n| South Asian | 1.4% | India, Pakistan, Nepal | Diverse community with various cultural practices |\n| White | 0.8% | Western countries | Expatriate community, mostly professionals |\n| Other | 1.2% | Various countries | Includes Koreans, Japanese, and Thais |\n[/TABLE]\nThe ethnic diversity in Hong Kong is significant, with the Chinese being the predominant ethnic group, making up approximately 92% of the population.
