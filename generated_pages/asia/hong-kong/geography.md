[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Hong Kong is situated on the southeastern coast of China, bordering the Guangdong province to the north and the special administrative region of Macau to the west. The region is surrounded by the South China Sea to the east, south, and west, and is separated from the Chinese mainland by the Sham Chun River to the north. Hong Kong's strategic location on the Pearl River Delta has made it an important center for trade and commerce in the region. The region's proximity to the South China Sea also makes it a significant hub for maritime trade, with the Port of Hong Kong being one of the busiest container ports in the world.

The region's borders are marked by a series of islands, including Hong Kong Island, Kowloon Peninsula, and the New Territories, which are connected to the mainland by several bridges and tunnels. The border with China is approximately 30 kilometers long, while the border with Macau is about 0.34 kilometers long. Hong Kong's unique location has allowed it to develop a distinct cultural and economic identity, separate from the rest of China. The region's history as a British colony has also had a significant impact on its language, customs, and architecture, making it a fascinating blend of East and West.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Hong Kong's terrain is characterized by a mix of rugged mountains, hills, and coastal plains. The region's highest point, Tai Mo Shan, is located in the New Territories and rises to an elevation of 957 meters. The Kowloon Hills and the Lion Rock are other notable mountain ranges in the region, with steep slopes and scenic views. The terrain is also dotted with numerous islands, including Lantau Island, which is home to the Hong Kong International Airport. The islands are volcanic in origin, with a mix of granite and sedimentary rocks.

The region's coastline is approximately 733 kilometers long, with a mix of sandy beaches, rocky shores, and mangrove swamps. The coastline is also home to several harbors and bays, including Victoria Harbour, which is one of the most iconic and bustling harbors in the world. The harbor is surrounded by towering skyscrapers and is a major hub for trade and commerce. The region's terrain and landscape have been shaped by millions of years of geological activity, including volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and erosion. As a result, the region is home to a diverse range of flora and fauna, including many rare and endangered species.

The region's landscape has also been shaped by human activity, including deforestation, urbanization, and land reclamation. Many of the region's natural habitats have been destroyed or degraded, leading to a loss of biodiversity and ecosystem disruption. However, in recent years, the government has implemented several conservation efforts, including the establishment of country parks and nature reserves, to protect the region's natural heritage. These efforts have helped to preserve many of the region's unique landscapes and ecosystems, including the Mai Po Nature Reserve, which is a wetland of international importance.
