The comfortable lifestyle of $7,000 per month, on the other hand, provides a very high standard of living, with the ability to afford a large apartment, eat out frequently, and enjoy many of the city's luxury amenities.\n\nIn comparison to neighboring countries, Hong Kong is significantly more expensive than China and Macau, but similar in price to other major cities in Asia such as Singapore and Tokyo. However, the city's unique blend of East and West, its stunning natural beauty, and its world-class infrastructure make it a desirable destination for many people. For those who can afford it, Hong Kong offers a unique and exciting lifestyle that is hard to find elsewhere.
