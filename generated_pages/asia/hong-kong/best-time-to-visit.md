[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Hong Kong has a **subtropical climate**, with four distinct seasons. The **dry season**, which runs from October to February, is characterized by mild temperatures and low humidity, making it the best time to visit. The **wet season**, from March to September, is marked by high temperatures and humidity, with occasional **typhoons** that can disrupt travel plans. The climate is influenced by its location in Southeast Asia, with the **monsoon season** bringing heavy rainfall during the summer months. Understanding the seasons is crucial in planning a trip to Hong Kong, as it can significantly affect the overall travel experience.

The **spring season**, from March to May, is a transitional period, with temperatures gradually warming up and humidity increasing. This is a good time to visit if you prefer milder weather, but it can be a bit crowded due to the **Easter holidays**. The **autumn season**, from September to November, is another popular time to visit, with comfortable temperatures and a range of festivals and events.

The **summer season**, from June to August, is the peak tourist season, with schools on summer break and families on vacation. However, the hot and humid weather can be challenging, especially for those not accustomed to it. The **winter season**, from December to February, is the coolest and driest time of the year, with mild temperatures and low humidity, making it an ideal time to explore the city.
