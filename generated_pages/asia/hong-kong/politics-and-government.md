[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Hong Kong operates under the Basic Law, which came into effect in 1997 when the territory was transferred from British to Chinese sovereignty. The political system is characterized by a high degree of autonomy, with the exception of foreign affairs and defense, which are handled by the Chinese government. The **separation of powers** is not strictly applied, as the **Chief Executive** serves as both the head of state and head of government. The Legislative Council, on the other hand, is responsible for enacting laws and approving the government's budget.

The political system in Hong Kong is often described as a **hybrid regime**, combining elements of liberal democracy and authoritarianism. While the territory enjoys a high degree of freedom and autonomy, the Chinese government has significant influence over the election of the Chief Executive and the composition of the Legislative Council. The **Election Committee**, which elects the Chief Executive, is composed of 1,500 members representing various sectors of society, including business, finance, and social services.

The government of Hong Kong has a unitary structure, with the Chief Executive serving as the head of the administration. The government is divided into several **policy bureaus**, each responsible for a specific area of policy, such as education, health, and finance. The bureaus are headed by **secretaries**, who are appointed by the Chief Executive. The government also has a number of **departments** and **agencies**, which are responsible for implementing policies and delivering public services.
