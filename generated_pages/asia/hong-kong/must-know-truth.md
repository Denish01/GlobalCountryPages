# The Truth About Hong Kong - History & Real Facts

Hong Kong is a special administrative region of China with a unique blend of East and West, where most people get wrong the notion that it is an independent country, when in reality it has been a part of China since 1997, operating under the "one country, two systems" framework.

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
Hong Kong was a British colony from 1842 to 1997, with the First Opium War marking the beginning of British rule. The Treaty of Nanking, signed on August 29, 1842, ceded Hong Kong Island to the British, followed by the signing of the Convention of Peking on October 18, 1860, which added the Kowloon Peninsula to British territory. The British government leased the New Territories from China for 99 years, starting from July 1, 1898, which was set to expire on June 30, 1997. On July 1, 1997, Hong Kong was transferred to China, becoming a special administrative region with a high degree of autonomy.

The **Sino-British Joint Declaration**, signed on December 19, 1984, laid out the framework for the transfer of sovereignty, ensuring that Hong Kong would maintain its capitalist system, way of life, and existing laws for 50 years. This declaration established the "one country, two systems" principle, which has been in place since the handover in 1997. The Basic Law, Hong Kong's constitutional document, was adopted on April 4, 1990, and came into effect on July 1, 1997, outlining the region's political structure and relationship with China.

The historical context of Hong Kong is complex, with the region having been under British rule for over 150 years. The **Treaty of Nanking** and the **Convention of Peking** are key documents that have shaped the region's history. The **Sino-British Joint Declaration** and the **Basic Law** are also crucial in understanding the current relationship between Hong Kong and China. The transition from a British colony to a special administrative region of China has been a significant event in Hong Kong's history, with the region continuing to maintain its unique blend of East and West.

The **one country, two systems** framework has allowed Hong Kong to maintain a high degree of autonomy, with its own economic, social, and cultural systems. The region has continued to thrive as a financial and trade center, with a strong focus on international trade and commerce. The historical context of Hong Kong is essential in understanding the region's current situation and its relationship with China.
