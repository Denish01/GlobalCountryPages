[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Hong Kong's healthcare system is a mix of public and private providers, with a strong emphasis on quality and accessibility. The public healthcare system is managed by the Hospital Authority, which operates 41 public hospitals and institutions, while the private sector offers a range of medical services, from general practice to specialized care. The quality of care in Hong Kong is generally excellent, with well-trained medical professionals and modern facilities. However, there can be long waiting times for non-emergency procedures in the public system, which may prompt some patients to seek private care. In terms of access, urban areas tend to have more comprehensive healthcare services than rural areas, although the government has made efforts to improve healthcare infrastructure in outlying regions.

The public healthcare system in Hong Kong is generally affordable, with subsidized rates for residents, although non-residents may be required to pay more for services. The private sector, on the other hand, can be quite expensive, although many private hospitals and clinics offer high-quality care and amenities. Overall, Hong Kong's healthcare system is well-regarded and provides a high level of care to its population.

One of the key strengths of Hong Kong's healthcare system is its emphasis on **preventive care**, with a range of programs and services aimed at promoting healthy lifestyles and detecting diseases early. The government also places a strong focus on **infection control** and **patient safety**, which has helped to minimize the risk of hospital-acquired infections and medical errors.
