[/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nHong Kong has a relatively liberal visa policy, with over 170 countries and territories having visa-free access or being eligible for a visa on arrival. Citizens of these countries can enter Hong Kong without a pre-arranged visa, and their length of stay varies from 7 to 180 days, depending on their nationality. The visa policy is designed to facilitate tourism, business, and cultural exchange, while maintaining national security and immigration control. Hong Kong's visa policy is separate from that of mainland China, and travelers should not assume that a Chinese visa is valid for entry into Hong Kong.\n\nThe Hong Kong government has implemented various measures to streamline the visa application process, including the introduction of electronic visas and online application systems. However, it is essential for travelers to check the latest visa requirements and regulations before planning their trip to Hong Kong.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Can enter multiple times within the 90-day period |\n| UK Citizens | No | Visa-free | 180 days | Can enter multiple times within the 180-day period |\n| EU Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Can enter multiple times within the 90-day period, except for Bulgaria, Croatia, and Romania, which have a 14-day limit |\n| Canadian Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Can enter multiple times within the 90-day period |\n| Australian Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Can enter multiple times within the 90-day period |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | Pre-arrival registration | 14 days | Must register online at least 24 hours before arrival |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Special administrative region travel permit | varies | Must obtain a special permit from the Chinese government |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can enter Hong Kong visa-free or on arrival, depending on their nationality.

They must provide an invitation letter from a Hong Kong-based company and proof of their business activities.

Upon arrival, travelers must proceed to the immigration counter, where they will be required to present their travel documents and complete a landing slip.

Travelers must also declare any dutiable goods or prohibited items and pay any applicable taxes or duties.\n\nTravelers can expect a relatively efficient and streamlined process at Hong Kong's immigration counters, with automated systems and e-channels available for eligible travelers. However, it is essential to ensure that all required documents are in order and that travelers are aware of the specific entry requirements for their nationality and purpose of visit.\n\n[SECTION] Common Mistakes To Avoid [/SECTION]\n- Failing to check the latest visa requirements and regulations before traveling\n- Not having a valid passport with at least six months' validity\n- Insufficient proof of onward travel or return ticket\n- Inadequate proof of sufficient funds to support stay\n- Not declaring dutiable goods or prohibited items\n- Not having the required documents, such as a hotel booking or travel itinerary, ready for presentation at immigration counter",
