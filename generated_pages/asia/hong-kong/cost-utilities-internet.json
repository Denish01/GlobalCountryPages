The costs of utilities in Hong Kong are generally stable, with some seasonal variation in electricity and gas consumption. During the summer months, electricity consumption tends to increase due to the use of air conditioning, while in the winter months, gas consumption may increase for heating. The overall cost of utilities is also influenced by the inflation rate, which was 1.7% in 2024, and the GDP per capita PPP, which was $75,196 in 2024.\n\nThe quality of utility services in Hong Kong is high, with a wide range of providers offering competitive pricing and reliable services. However, the cost of utilities can vary depending on the location, size, and type of accommodation. For example, apartments in the city center tend to be more expensive than those in the suburbs. Additionally, the cost of utilities can be affected by the type of building and its age, with newer buildings often having more energy-efficient systems.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $80 | $120 | $180 | |\n| Water | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $15 | $20 | |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | (included in rent) |\n| **Total** | **$120** | **$180** | **$260** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $20-30 | 30 Mbps | PCCW, HKT |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $40-60 | 1000 Mbps | PCCW, HKT, Netvigator |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-20 | 5 GB | CSL, SmarTone |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-50 | 10 GB | CSL, SmarTone, 3 Hong Kong |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $50-100 | varies | PCCW, HKT, Netvigator |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (e.g. Viu, TVBAnywhere) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Hong Kong, it is recommended to contact the providers directly, such as CLP Power for electricity and Hong Kong Water for water supply.\n- Prepaid electricity meters are available, but postpaid plans are more common and often more convenient.\n- For internet services, PCCW and HKT are two of the largest providers, offering a range of plans and speeds.\n- To save on utility bills, it is recommended to use energy-efficient appliances, turn off lights and electronics when not in use, and take advantage of promotions and discounts offered by providers.\n- It is also a good idea to compare prices and plans from different providers to find the best deals for your needs and budget.",
