[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Hong Kong has a relatively liberal visa policy, with over 160 countries and territories enjoying visa-free access for varying periods of time. This makes it a popular destination for tourists, business travelers, and students. The visa policy is designed to facilitate travel and trade, while also ensuring the security and integrity of the region. Visitors from eligible countries can enter Hong Kong without a visa for a specified period, which ranges from 7 to 180 days, depending on their nationality.

The Hong Kong government has implemented various measures to streamline the visa application process and make it more convenient for visitors. For example, the online visa application system allows applicants to submit their applications and supporting documents electronically, reducing the need for paper-based submissions.
