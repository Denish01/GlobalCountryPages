[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Hong Kong has a relatively liberal visa policy, with over 170 countries and territories having visa-free access or being eligible for a visa on arrival. Citizens of these countries can enter Hong Kong without a pre-arranged visa, and their length of stay varies from 7 to 180 days, depending on their nationality. The visa policy is designed to facilitate tourism, business, and cultural exchange, while maintaining national security and immigration control. Hong Kong's visa policy is separate from that of mainland China, and travelers should not assume that a Chinese visa is valid for entry into Hong Kong.

The Hong Kong government has implemented various measures to streamline the visa application process, including the introduction of electronic visas and online application systems. However, it is essential for travelers to check the latest visa requirements and regulations before planning their trip to Hong Kong.
