# Kazakhstan Visa & Entry Requirements

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Kazakhstan before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Kazakhstan has a moderate visa policy, allowing citizens of certain countries to enter visa-free or obtain a visa on arrival. The country has been working to liberalize its visa regime in recent years, making it easier for tourists and business travelers to visit. Currently, citizens of over 60 countries can enter Kazakhstan without a visa, including those from the European Union, the United States, and Japan. However, the length of stay and requirements for registration vary depending on nationality.

The visa policy of Kazakhstan is designed to facilitate travel and trade while ensuring national security. The country has introduced an electronic visa system, which allows eligible citizens to apply for a visa online and receive it via email. This system has streamlined the application process and reduced processing times. Additionally, Kazakhstan has introduced a visa-free regime for transit passengers, allowing them to stay in the country for up to 72 hours without a visa.
