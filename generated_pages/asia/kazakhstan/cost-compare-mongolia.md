Kazakhstan and Mongolia are two neighboring countries in Central Asia with distinct economic profiles. Kazakhstan has a more diversified economy, with significant oil and gas reserves, while Mongolia's economy is heavily reliant on mining and agriculture. As a result, Kazakhstan has a higher GDP per capita and a more stable economy, which is reflected in its lower cost of living. The cost of living in Kazakhstan is generally lower due to its larger economy and more developed infrastructure, which leads to lower prices for housing, food, and transportation.
