The country's strategic location at the crossroads of Europe and Asia has also led to the incorporation of various international influences, including Russian, Chinese, and Central Asian flavors. Regional variations are also notable, with the northern regions favoring more Russian-style dishes, while the southern regions have a stronger Uzbek and Turkmen influence. The country's cuisine is also shaped by its Islamic heritage, with many restaurants serving halal food and avoiding pork and alcohol.\n\nKazakh cuisine is often hearty and simple, with a focus on local ingredients and traditional cooking methods. **Shashlik**, or skewers of marinated meat, are a popular dish throughout the country, while **Kuyrdak**, a traditional soup made with meat and noodles, is a staple in many Kazakh households. The country's cuisine is also known for its rich variety of breads, including **Naan** and **Baursak**, which are often served with meals or as a snack.\n\nThe country's modernization and urbanization have also led to the development of a more contemporary food scene, with many restaurants in cities like Astana and Almaty serving a range of international cuisine, from Italian to Japanese. However, traditional Kazakh cuisine remains a vital part of the country's cultural heritage, and visitors can experience it firsthand by trying local dishes and drinks.\n\n[SECTION] Must-Try Dishes [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Dish | Type | Description | Where to Find |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Beshbarmak | National Dish | horse meat and noodle dish | traditional restaurants |\n| Shashlik | Skewers | marinated meat skewers | street food stalls and restaurants |\n| Kuyrdak | Soup | traditional soup made with meat and noodles | local eateries |\n| Manty | Dumplings | steamed dumplings filled with meat and onions | markets and restaurants |\n| Plov | Rice Dish | pilaf made with meat, onions, and carrots | traditional restaurants |\n| Shashlik Kebabs | Skewers | marinated meat skewers, often served with onions and bread | street food stalls |\n| Baursak | Bread | traditional fried bread, often served with tea | markets and bakeries |\n| Kazi | Meat Dish | horse meat sausage, often served with bread and onions | traditional restaurants |\n| Kurut | Snack | dried milk balls, often served as a snack | markets and street food stalls |\n| Kuyrdak Somsa | Pastry | traditional pastry filled with meat and onions | bakeries and markets |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Street Food & Snacks [/SECTION]\n- **Shashlik Kebabs**: marinated meat skewers, often served with onions and bread, $3-5 USD\n- **Baursak**: traditional fried bread, often served with tea, $1-2 USD\n- **Kurut**: dried milk balls, often served as a snack, $2-3 USD\n- **Manty**: steamed dumplings filled with meat and onions, $5-7 USD\n- **Somsa**: traditional pastry filled with meat and onions, $2-3 USD\n- **Kuyrdak**: traditional soup made with meat and noodles, $3-5 USD\n\n[SECTION] Drinks [/SECTION]\n- **Kumis**: traditional fermented horse milk drink, $2-3 USD\n- **Shubat**: fermented camel milk drink, $3-5 USD\n- **Chai**: traditional tea, often served with bread and sweets, $1-2 USD\n- **Kazakh beer**: local beer, $3-5 USD\n- **Vodka**: popular spirit, often served with meals, $5-10 USD\n- **Airan**: yogurt-based drink, often served with meals, $2-3 USD\n\n[SECTION] Dining Customs [/SECTION]\n- Table manners are generally formal, with an emphasis on respect for elders and tradition\n- It is customary to wait for the host to invite you to sit and start eating\n- Hands should be washed before meals, and it is considered impolite to eat with the left hand\n- Tipping is not expected, but 5-10% of the total bill is appreciated\n- Reservations are not always necessary, but it is recommended for popular restaurants\n- Dress codes are generally casual, but more formal attire may be required for high-end restaurants\n\n[SECTION] Where to Eat [/SECTION]\n- **Traditional restaurants**: serve traditional Kazakh cuisine, often with a focus on local ingredients and cooking methods\n- **Markets**: offer a range of street food and local snacks, including **Shashlik Kebabs** and **Baursak**\n- **Food courts**: provide a variety of international cuisine, from Italian to Japanese\n- **Cafes**: serve traditional tea and coffee, often with pastries and sweets\n- **Bakeries**: offer a range of traditional breads, including **Naan** and **Baursak**\n\n[SECTION] Food Markets & Food Experiences [/SECTION]\n- **Green Market**: a large market in Almaty offering a range of fresh produce, meats, and local snacks\n- **Panfilov Market**: a bustling market in Astana selling traditional Kazakh cuisine, including **Shashlik Kebabs** and **Manty**\n- **Almaty Food Festival**: an annual festival celebrating traditional Kazakh cuisine and local ingredients\n- **Kazakh Culinary Tour**: a guided tour of local restaurants and markets, offering a taste of traditional Kazakh cuisine\n- **Astana Food Court**: a modern food court in the capital city, offering a range of international cuisine and local snacks",
