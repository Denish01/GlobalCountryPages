[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Kazakhstan has a mixed economy, with a strong focus on natural resources, particularly oil and gas. The country's economy is classified as upper-middle income, with a GDP per capita of around $8,700. Over the past few decades, Kazakhstan has experienced rapid economic growth, driven by large-scale investments in the energy sector and strategic location along key trade routes. The country has made significant progress in diversifying its economy, with a growing services sector and increasing investments in manufacturing and agriculture. However, the economy remains heavily reliant on oil exports, making it vulnerable to fluctuations in global energy prices.

Kazakhstan's economic development has been shaped by its strategic location at the crossroads of Europe and Asia. The country has invested heavily in developing its transportation infrastructure, including roads, railways, and ports, to facilitate trade between Europe and Asia. This has made Kazakhstan an important transit country for goods and energy, generating significant revenue from transportation and logistics services. The government has also implemented policies to attract foreign investment, including the creation of special economic zones and tax incentives for foreign companies.

Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, Kazakhstan's economy has continued to grow, albeit at a slower pace. The government has implemented measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, including fiscal stimulus packages and support for small and medium-sized enterprises. Looking ahead, Kazakhstan's economic trajectory is expected to be shaped by its continued integration into global trade networks, including the Eurasian Economic Union and the Belt and Road Initiative.
