        <h2>How Kazakhstan Is Divided</h2>
        <p>Kazakhstan is divided into 14 provinces, also known as oblys, and 3 cities with special status. The provinces are further divided into districts, which are then divided into villages and towns. The 3 cities with special status, Almaty, Astana, and Baikonur, are not part of any province and are directly under the central government. This administrative structure allows for efficient governance and management of the country's vast territory.</p>
        <p>The 14 provinces of Kazakhstan are Akmola, Aktobe, Almaty, Atyrau, East Kazakhstan, Karaganda, Kostanay, Kyzylorda, Mangystau, North Kazakhstan, Pavlodar, South Kazakhstan, West Kazakhstan, and Zhambyl. Each province has its own capital city and is responsible for managing local affairs, such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure development. The central government, on the other hand, is responsible for national policies, foreign affairs, and defense.</p>

        <p>Kazakhstan has a well-developed transportation network, with domestic flights, trains, and buses connecting major cities. The country's rail network is extensive, with many trains running between cities, including the popular Turkestan-Siberian Railway. Domestic flights are also available, with many airlines operating flights between major cities. Buses are also a popular mode of transportation, with many private companies operating bus services between cities.

However, the country is investing heavily in road development, with many new highways and roads being built.</p>
        <p>Overall, getting around Kazakhstan is relatively easy, with many transportation options available. However, it is recommended to plan ahead and book tickets in advance, especially during peak travel seasons. Additionally, visitors should be prepared for long travel times and distances, due to the country's vast territory. [CALLOUT] It is also recommended to learn some basic Kazakh and Russian phrases, as not many people speak English outside of major cities.</p>
