        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Kazakhstan, the world's largest landlocked country, has a rich and diverse history that spans over 2,500 years. The territory was first inhabited by various nomadic tribes, including the <strong>Saka</strong> and <strong>Massagetae</strong>, who were later influenced by the <strong>Mongol Empire</strong> in the 13th century. In the 19th century, Kazakhstan became a part of the <strong>Russian Empire</strong>, which had a significant impact on the country's language, culture, and economy. On December 16, 1991, Kazakhstan declared its independence from the <strong>Soviet Union</strong>, becoming the last of the Soviet republics to do so.</p>
        <p>The early years of independence were marked by significant economic and social challenges, including a decline in industrial production and a rise in poverty. However, under the leadership of President <strong>Nursultan Nazarbayev</strong>, Kazakhstan was able to implement various economic reforms and attract foreign investment, which helped to stabilize the economy. In 1997, the capital city was moved from <strong>Almaty</strong> to <strong>Astana</strong>, which was previously known as Akmola. This move was aimed at reducing the country's dependence on the southern region and promoting economic development in the north.</p>
        <p>Kazakhstan's strategic location has made it an important player in regional and international affairs. The country has been a member of the <strong>Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)</strong> since its inception in 1991 and has also been actively involved in the <strong>Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO)</strong> and the <strong>Eurasian Economic Union (EEU)</strong>. In recent years, Kazakhstan has sought to diversify its economy and reduce its dependence on oil exports, which have been the main driver of the country's economic growth.</p>
        <p>The country's history and cultural heritage are reflected in its diverse architecture, music, and art. The <strong>Kazakh</strong> people have a rich tradition of storytelling, music, and dance, which are often performed during traditional festivals and celebrations. The country is also home to several important historical sites, including the <strong>Mausoleum of Khoja Ahmed Yasawi</strong> and the <strong>Turkistan Fortress</strong>, which are both UNESCO World Heritage Sites.</p>
