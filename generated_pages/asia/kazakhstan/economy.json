The country's economy is classified as upper-middle income, with a GDP per capita of around $8,700. Over the past few decades, Kazakhstan has experienced rapid economic growth, driven by large-scale investments in the energy sector and strategic location along key trade routes. The country has made significant progress in diversifying its economy, with a growing services sector and increasing investments in manufacturing and agriculture. However, the economy remains heavily reliant on oil exports, making it vulnerable to fluctuations in global energy prices.\n\nKazakhstan's economic development has been shaped by its strategic location at the crossroads of Europe and Asia. The country has invested heavily in developing its transportation infrastructure, including roads, railways, and ports, to facilitate trade between Europe and Asia. This has made Kazakhstan an important transit country for goods and energy, generating significant revenue from transportation and logistics services. The government has also implemented policies to attract foreign investment, including the creation of special economic zones and tax incentives for foreign companies.\n\nDespite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, Kazakhstan's economy has continued to grow, albeit at a slower pace. The government has implemented measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, including fiscal stimulus packages and support for small and medium-sized enterprises. Looking ahead, Kazakhstan's economic trajectory is expected to be shaped by its continued integration into global trade networks, including the Eurasian Economic Union and the Belt and Road Initiative.\n\n[SECTION] Key Industries [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Industry | Contribution | Details |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Oil and Gas | 20% of GDP | Kazakhstan is a significant oil producer, with major fields in the Caspian Sea and western regions |\n| Mining | 15% of GDP | The country is rich in mineral resources, including coal, iron ore, and copper |\n| Agriculture | 10% of GDP | Kazakhstan is a major producer of wheat, cotton, and livestock products |\n| Manufacturing | 8% of GDP | The sector is growing, with a focus on food processing, textiles, and machinery |\n| Services | 40% of GDP | The services sector is the largest contributor to GDP, including finance, transportation, and logistics |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Trade Profile [/SECTION]\n**Top Exports:** \n- **Oil and Gas**: Kazakhstan's main export, with major markets in China, Russia, and Europe\n- **Minerals**: The country exports significant quantities of coal, iron ore, and copper to countries such as China and Japan\n- **Agricultural Products**: Wheat, cotton, and livestock products are exported to countries in the Middle East, Europe, and Asia\n- **Machinery**: Kazakhstan exports machinery and equipment to countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)\n- **Chemicals**: The country exports chemicals and petrochemicals to countries in Europe and Asia\n**Top Imports:** \n- **Machinery and Equipment**: Kazakhstan imports machinery and equipment from countries such as China, Russia, and Germany\n- **Transportation Vehicles**: The country imports vehicles from countries such as Russia, China, and Japan\n- **Electronics**: Kazakhstan imports electronics from countries such as China, South Korea, and Japan\n- **Food Products**: The country imports food products from countries such as Russia, China, and Europe\n- **Pharmaceuticals**: Kazakhstan imports pharmaceuticals from countries such as Russia, China, and Europe\n**Key Trading Partners:** \n- China: Kazakhstan's largest trading partner, with significant trade in oil, gas, and minerals\n- Russia: A major trading partner, with significant trade in energy, machinery, and agricultural products\n- Germany: A key trading partner in Europe, with significant trade in machinery, equipment, and chemicals\n- Ukraine: A significant trading partner in the CIS region, with trade in agricultural products, machinery, and equipment\n- Italy: A key trading partner in Europe, with significant trade in machinery, equipment, and textiles\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n- Kazakhstan has a well-developed transportation network, including over 100,000 km of roads and 15,000 km of railways\n- The country has a growing energy sector, with significant investments in renewable energy, including wind and solar power\n- Internet penetration is around 70%, with mobile phone coverage available in most areas\n- Kazakhstan has several major ports, including the port of Aktau on the Caspian Sea, and international airports in Almaty and Astana\n- The country is also investing in the development of its logistics and transportation infrastructure, including the creation of special economic zones and free trade zones\n\n[SECTION] Economic Outlook [/SECTION]\nKazakhstan's economy is expected to continue growing, driven by investments in the energy sector, transportation infrastructure, and manufacturing.
