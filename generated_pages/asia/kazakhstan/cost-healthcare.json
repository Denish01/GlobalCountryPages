  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Kazakhstan can vary significantly depending on the type of service, location, and whether you choose public or private healthcare options, with the average health expenditure per capita being around $490 per year. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $490 (2023)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 27.6% (2023)\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 103\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: KZT\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nKazakhstan has a mixed healthcare system, which combines elements of both public and private healthcare. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to private healthcare, but it is more affordable and widely available. Locals typically use the public healthcare system, while foreigners and those who can afford it often opt for private healthcare. The public healthcare system is funded by the government and provides basic medical care, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and surgeries. However, the quality of care can vary significantly depending on the location and the specific hospital or clinic. Private healthcare, on the other hand, offers higher-quality care and more modern facilities, but it can be quite expensive.\n\nIn Kazakhstan, it is recommended to have health insurance, especially for foreigners and those who plan to stay in the country for an extended period. The government has introduced a mandatory health insurance program for citizens, but it does not cover all medical expenses, and the quality of care can be limited. Private health insurance can help fill the gap and provide access to better-quality care. Additionally, many private hospitals and clinics require payment upfront, so having health insurance can help cover unexpected medical expenses.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $5-10 | $20-50 | Public hospitals may have long wait times |\n| Specialist Consultation | $10-20 | $50-100 | Private clinics may offer more specialized care |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-20 | $30-70 | Private dentists may offer more modern equipment |\n| Eye Exam | $5-10 | $20-50 | Public hospitals may have limited eye care services |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $5-10 | $20-50 | Private labs may offer faster results |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $20-50 | Public hospitals may have limited emergency services |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $20-100 | Private hospitals may offer more comfortable rooms |\n| Basic Surgery | $100-500 | Private clinics may offer more specialized surgeons |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $200-1,000 | Private hospitals may offer more modern maternity services |\n| MRI Scan | $100-300 | Private clinics may offer more advanced imaging technology |\n| X-Ray | $10-50 | Public hospitals may have limited imaging services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-50 | Public hospital care, basic medical services |\n| Comprehensive Private | $50-100 | Private hospital care, specialized services, dental and eye care |\n| International / Expat | $100-200 | Global coverage, emergency evacuation, high-end medical services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medication can cost between $5-20 per month, depending on the type and brand.\n- Over-the-counter medication is widely available and can cost between $2-10 per packet.\n- Pharmacies are readily available in major cities, but may be limited in rural areas.\n- Some medications may require a prescription from a local doctor, while others can be purchased over-the-counter.\n- Prices for medication can vary depending on the location and the specific pharmacy.\n- It is recommended to bring any necessary prescription medication with you when traveling to Kazakhstan, as availability and quality may vary.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the local emergency number, 103, or visit the nearest hospital. Ambulance services are available, but may not always be equipped with modern medical equipment. For foreigners, it is recommended to visit a private hospital or clinic, as they often have more modern facilities and English-speaking staff. Some of the best hospitals for foreigners in Kazakhstan include the **International Medical Center** in Astana and the **European Medical Center** in Almaty. These hospitals offer high-quality care and have experience treating international patients. However, it is still important to have health insurance, as medical expenses can add up quickly, even in an emergency situation.\n\nIt is also a good idea to research local hospitals and clinics before an emergency arises, and to have a plan in place for emergency care. This can include knowing the location of the nearest hospital, having a list of emergency contact numbers, and having a basic understanding of the local healthcare system. By being prepared and having the right resources, you can help ensure that you receive the best possible care in the event of a medical emergency in Kazakhstan.",
