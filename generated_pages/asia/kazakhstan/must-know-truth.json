  "content": "[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]\nKazakhstan, the world's largest landlocked country, has a rich and diverse history that spans over 2,500 years. The territory was first inhabited by various nomadic tribes, including the **Saka** and **Massagetae**, who were later influenced by the **Mongol Empire** in the 13th century. In the 19th century, Kazakhstan became a part of the **Russian Empire**, which had a significant impact on the country's language, culture, and economy. On December 16, 1991, Kazakhstan declared its independence from the **Soviet Union**, becoming the last of the Soviet republics to do so.\n\nThe early years of independence were marked by significant economic and social challenges, including a decline in industrial production and a rise in poverty. However, under the leadership of President **Nursultan Nazarbayev**, Kazakhstan was able to implement various economic reforms and attract foreign investment, which helped to stabilize the economy. In 1997, the capital city was moved from **Almaty** to **Astana**, which was previously known as Akmola. This move was aimed at reducing the country's dependence on the southern region and promoting economic development in the north.\n\nKazakhstan's strategic location has made it an important player in regional and international affairs. The country has been a member of the **Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)** since its inception in 1991 and has also been actively involved in the **Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO)** and the **Eurasian Economic Union (EEU)**. In recent years, Kazakhstan has sought to diversify its economy and reduce its dependence on oil exports, which have been the main driver of the country's economic growth.\n\nThe country's history and cultural heritage are reflected in its diverse architecture, music, and art. The **Kazakh** people have a rich tradition of storytelling, music, and dance, which are often performed during traditional festivals and celebrations. The country is also home to several important historical sites, including the **Mausoleum of Khoja Ahmed Yasawi** and the **Turkistan Fortress**, which are both UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\n\n[SECTION] Common Misconceptions [/SECTION]\n[CALLOUT] Misconception: \"Kazakhstan is a small country\"\nReality: Kazakhstan is the world's largest landlocked country, covering an area of approximately 2.7 million square kilometers, which is roughly the size of Western Europe.
