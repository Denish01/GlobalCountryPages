[SECTION] Food Culture Overview [/SECTION]
Kazakhstan's cuisine is defined by its nomadic heritage, with a focus on meat, particularly horse meat, as well as noodles, onions, and bread. The country's strategic location at the crossroads of Europe and Asia has also led to the incorporation of various international influences, including Russian, Chinese, and Central Asian flavors. Regional variations are also notable, with the northern regions favoring more Russian-style dishes, while the southern regions have a stronger Uzbek and Turkmen influence. The country's cuisine is also shaped by its Islamic heritage, with many restaurants serving halal food and avoiding pork and alcohol.

Kazakh cuisine is often hearty and simple, with a focus on local ingredients and traditional cooking methods. **Shashlik**, or skewers of marinated meat, are a popular dish throughout the country, while **Kuyrdak**, a traditional soup made with meat and noodles, is a staple in many Kazakh households. The country's cuisine is also known for its rich variety of breads, including **Naan** and **Baursak**, which are often served with meals or as a snack.

The country's modernization and urbanization have also led to the development of a more contemporary food scene, with many restaurants in cities like Astana and Almaty serving a range of international cuisine, from Italian to Japanese. However, traditional Kazakh cuisine remains a vital part of the country's cultural heritage, and visitors can experience it firsthand by trying local dishes and drinks.
