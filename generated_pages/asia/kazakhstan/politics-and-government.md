[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Kazakhstan is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The president serves as the head of state and is directly elected by the people for a five-year term. The prime minister is the head of government and is appointed by the president. The parliament, known as the **Mazhilis**, is a bicameral legislature consisting of the Senate and the Mazhilis. The Senate has 47 members, with 15 appointed by the president and 32 elected by the **mäslihats** (local councils). The Mazhilis has 107 members, all of whom are directly elected by the people for five-year terms. The separation of powers in Kazakhstan is designed to provide a system of checks and balances, with each branch having distinct responsibilities and powers.

The political system in Kazakhstan is characterized by a strong presidency, with the president holding significant executive powers. The president is also the commander-in-chief of the armed forces and has the power to appoint and dismiss the prime minister and other government officials. The parliament, on the other hand, has the power to pass laws, approve the budget, and exercise oversight over the government. The judicial branch is independent and has the power to interpret laws and resolve disputes.

Kazakhstan is a **unitary state**, with a centralized government and a single, unified system of laws. The country is divided into 14 provinces, each with its own governor and local government. The provinces have some degree of autonomy, but the central government retains significant powers and control over key areas such as taxation, defense, and foreign policy.
