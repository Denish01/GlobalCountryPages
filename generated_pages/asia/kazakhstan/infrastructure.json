  "content": "Kazakhstan's infrastructure is a mix of modern and outdated systems, with significant investments being made to improve the country's roads, energy, and telecommunications networks. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 100% of population\nInternet Penetration: 78.9%\nRoad Network: 97,700 km, with varying quality\nRail Network: 16,000 km\nMajor Airports: 11\nMajor Ports: 0, landlocked\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nKazakhstan has been investing heavily in its infrastructure development, with a focus on improving the country's connectivity and economic competitiveness. The government has launched several initiatives to upgrade the country's roads, railways, and airports, as well as to increase access to electricity, water, and sanitation. However, despite these efforts, there remains a significant gap between urban and rural areas, with many rural communities still lacking access to basic services. The country's infrastructure development is also hindered by its vast territory and harsh climate, which can make it difficult and expensive to build and maintain infrastructure.\n\nIn recent years, Kazakhstan has made significant progress in developing its infrastructure, with the government investing billions of dollars in new projects. The country has also been actively promoting public-private partnerships to attract foreign investment and expertise. As a result, Kazakhstan's infrastructure is becoming increasingly modern and efficient, with new roads, railways, and airports being built to international standards. However, more needs to be done to address the urban-rural gap and to ensure that all communities have access to basic services.\n\nKazakhstan's infrastructure development is also closely tied to its economic development, with the government seeking to diversify the country's economy and reduce its dependence on oil exports. The development of new industries, such as manufacturing and tourism, will require significant investments in infrastructure, including roads, railways, and telecommunications networks. As a result, the government is prioritizing infrastructure development as a key driver of economic growth and competitiveness.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 97,700 km | Good | High-quality roads connect major cities, but rural areas often have poor roads |\n| Railways | 16,000 km | Moderate | Rail network is extensive, but much of it is outdated and in need of upgrade |\n| Airports | 11 international, 20 domestic | Good | Major airports are modern and well-equipped, but smaller airports may lack facilities |\n| Ports | 0 major | N/A | Kazakhstan is landlocked, but has access to the Caspian Sea via a port in Aktau |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- Kazakhstan has a diverse energy mix, with **coal**, **oil**, and **natural gas** being the main sources of power generation.\n- The country has made significant progress in increasing its **renewable energy** capacity, with a focus on **wind** and **solar power**.\n- However, the energy sector is still dominated by **fossil fuels**, which can make it vulnerable to price fluctuations and supply disruptions.\n- Kazakhstan has a relatively reliable electricity grid, with **outages** being rare in urban areas.\n- The government has launched initiatives to improve **energy efficiency** and reduce **energy consumption**, with a focus on promoting **sustainable development**.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- Kazakhstan has made significant progress in increasing access to **safe drinking water**, with over 90% of the population having access to **tap water**.\n- However, **water quality** can be a concern, particularly in rural areas where **water treatment** facilities may be lacking.\n- **Sanitation** coverage is also a concern, with many rural communities lacking access to **modern sanitation** facilities.\n- The government has launched initiatives to improve **water management** and increase access to **safe sanitation**, with a focus on promoting **public health**.\n- Kazakhstan has also made progress in protecting its **water resources**, with a focus on reducing **water pollution** and promoting **sustainable use**.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- Kazakhstan has a relatively well-developed **telecommunications** network, with over 70% of the population having access to **mobile phone** services.\n- The country has also made significant progress in increasing **internet penetration**, with over 70% of the population having access to **broadband** services.\n- **Fiber-optic** networks are being rolled out in major cities, with a focus on promoting **high-speed internet** access.\n- Kazakhstan has also launched initiatives to promote **digital literacy** and increase access to **online services**, with a focus on promoting **e-government** and **e-commerce**.\n- The government has also invested in **postal services**, with a focus on improving **mail delivery** and **logistics**.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The government has launched a number of major infrastructure projects, including the development of a new **railway** line connecting Kazakhstan to China and Europe.\n- Kazakhstan is also investing in the development of its **airports**, with a focus on increasing **cargo** and **passenger** capacity.\n- The country has launched initiatives to improve its **road network**, with a focus on upgrading **highways** and **interchanges**.\n- Kazakhstan is also investing in the development of its **energy sector**, with a focus on increasing **renewable energy** capacity and improving **energy efficiency**.\n- The government has also launched initiatives to improve **water management** and increase access to **safe sanitation**, with a focus on promoting **public health** and **sustainable development**.",
