[SECTION] Overview: Kazakhstan vs Russia [/SECTION]
Kazakhstan and Russia are two of the largest countries in the world, sharing a long border and a rich cultural heritage. However, when it comes to the cost of living, Kazakhstan offers a more affordable option for those looking to live, work, or study in the region. The economic context of Kazakhstan is driven by its oil and gas industry, which has led to significant investments in infrastructure and a growing middle class. On the other hand, Russia's economy is more diversified, with a strong focus on manufacturing, energy, and services. Despite these differences, Kazakhstan's lower cost of living makes it an attractive option for those looking to stretch their budget further.

In terms of overall cost levels, Kazakhstan is generally 20-30% cheaper than Russia, with lower prices for housing, food, transportation, and utilities. However, it's worth noting that prices can vary significantly depending on the location, with cities like Astana and Almaty in Kazakhstan, and Moscow and St. Petersburg in Russia, tend to be more expensive than smaller towns and rural areas. Additionally, the cost of living in Kazakhstan can vary depending on the region, with the western regions tend to be more expensive due to the oil and gas industry.
