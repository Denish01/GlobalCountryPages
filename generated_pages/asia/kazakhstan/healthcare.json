  "content": "Healthcare in Kazakhstan is a mixed system that offers both public and private options, with varying levels of quality and accessibility across the country.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nQuality Rating: Good\nEmergency Number: 103\nHospital Standard: Good\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: widespread\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nKazakhstan's healthcare system is a mixed model that combines elements of public and private healthcare. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of good quality, with well-equipped hospitals and qualified medical staff in urban areas. However, the quality of care can vary significantly in rural areas, where facilities and resources may be more limited. The private healthcare sector is also well-developed, with many high-quality clinics and hospitals catering to expatriates and affluent locals. Kazakhstan has made significant progress in recent years in improving its healthcare system, with a focus on increasing access to healthcare services, particularly in rural areas.\n\nThe public healthcare system in Kazakhstan is generally free or low-cost for citizens, with most medical services covered by the state. However, the system can be bureaucratic and waiting times for non-emergency procedures can be long. Private healthcare, on the other hand, offers faster access to medical services and higher-quality care, but at a significantly higher cost. Many expatriates and affluent locals opt for private health insurance to cover the cost of private healthcare services.\n\nDespite the progress made in improving the healthcare system, Kazakhstan still faces challenges in terms of healthcare accessibility and quality, particularly in rural areas. The country has a significant shortage of medical professionals, particularly in specialized fields, and many medical facilities lack modern equipment and technology. However, the government has implemented initiatives to address these challenges, including programs to attract and retain medical professionals, and investments in modern medical equipment and technology.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| National Scientific Medical Center | Astana | Public | Cardiology, Oncology, Neurosurgery | Yes |\n| University Medical Center | Almaty | Public | General Medicine, Surgery, Pediatrics | Limited |\n| Medical Center Hospital | Astana | Private | General Medicine, Surgery, Orthopedics | Yes |\n| International Clinic | Almaty | Private | General Medicine, Pediatrics, Dental | Yes |\n| City Hospital No. 1 | Karaganda | Public | General Medicine, Surgery, Emergency | Limited |\n| Central Hospital | Shymkent | Public | General Medicine, Surgery, Obstetrics | Limited |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Private health insurance** is recommended for expatriates and individuals who want to access private healthcare services.\n- **Local insurance options** are available, but may not provide the same level of coverage as international insurance plans.\n- **Expatriate health insurance** plans are available from international insurance providers, and often offer more comprehensive coverage than local plans.\n- The **cost of health insurance** in Kazakhstan can vary widely, depending on the type and level of coverage, as well as the individual's age and health status.\n- **Group health insurance** plans are also available for companies and organizations, and can provide a more cost-effective option for employees.\n- **Travel insurance** is also recommended for visitors to Kazakhstan, as it can provide coverage for unexpected medical emergencies.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Medications** are widely available in Kazakhstan, including both prescription and over-the-counter medications.\n- **Prescription requirements** vary depending on the type of medication, but many medications are available over-the-counter.\n- **Common brands** of medications are available in Kazakhstan, including international brands such as Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline.\n- **Costs** of medications in Kazakhstan can vary widely, depending on the type and brand of medication, as well as the location and type of pharmacy.\n- **Pharmacy access** is widespread in urban areas, with many pharmacies located in shopping centers and near hospitals.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Hepatitis A** and **hepatitis B** vaccinations are recommended for travelers to Kazakhstan.\n- **Rabies** vaccination is also recommended, particularly for individuals who will be working with animals or spending time in rural areas.\n- **Typhoid** vaccination is recommended for individuals who will be eating or drinking outside of major restaurants and hotels.\n- **Malaria** is present in some areas of Kazakhstan, particularly in the southern regions.\n- **Water safety** is a concern in Kazakhstan, and travelers are advised to drink bottled or filtered water.\n- **Food safety** is also a concern, and travelers are advised to eat at reputable restaurants and avoid undercooked meat and raw vegetables.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **Medical tourism** is a growing industry in Kazakhstan, with many high-quality hospitals and clinics catering to international patients.\n- **Popular procedures** include orthopedic surgery, cosmetic surgery, and dental procedures.\n- **Accredited hospitals** include the National Scientific Medical Center and the University Medical Center.\n- **Cost savings** can be significant for medical tourists, with prices for procedures often lower than in Western countries.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- In the event of a **medical emergency**, call the emergency number 103.\n- **Ambulance reliability** can vary depending on the location, but most major cities have reliable ambulance services.\n- **Nearest hospitals** can be found by asking locals or using a mapping app.\n- **Insurance claims** should be submitted to the insurance provider as soon as possible after the emergency.\n- **Medical evacuation** may be necessary in some cases, particularly if the individual requires specialized care not available in Kazakhstan.",
