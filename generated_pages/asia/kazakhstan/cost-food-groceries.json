However, prices can vary depending on the location, with cities like Astana and Almaty tend to be more expensive than smaller towns. The country's strategic location and extensive trade networks also contribute to the relatively low prices of food staples like grains, meat, and dairy products. The eating-out culture in Kazakhstan is not as prevalent as in other countries, with many locals preferring to cook at home, which can help keep food costs down.\n\nThe main drivers of food prices in Kazakhstan are inflation, which stood at 8.8% in 2024, and seasonal fluctuations in supply and demand. The country's economy is also heavily reliant on oil exports, which can impact the overall cost of living, including food prices. Despite these factors, Kazakhstan offers a wide range of affordable food options, from traditional dishes like **beshbarmak** (noodle soup) and **shashlik** (skewered meat) to modern restaurants serving international cuisine. For those looking to cook at home, local markets and supermarkets offer a variety of fresh produce, meat, and dairy products at competitive prices.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $0.80-$1.20 | 300-400 KZT | |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $0.50-$1.00 | 200-300 KZT | |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $1.00-$1.50 | 400-600 KZT | |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $1.20-$2.00 | 500-800 KZT | |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $3.00-$4.50 | 1,200-1,800 KZT | |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $5.00-$7.00 | 2,000-2,800 KZT | |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $1.50-$2.50 | 600-1,000 KZT | |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $1.00-$2.00 | 400-800 KZT | |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $0.50-$1.00 | 200-400 KZT | |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $0.50-$1.00 | 200-400 KZT | |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $5.00-$7.00 | 2,000-2,800 KZT | |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $0.50-$1.00 | 200-400 KZT | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $3-$5 | (typical dishes like shashlik or beshbarmak) |\n| Casual Restaurant | $10-$15 | (one person, 2-3 courses) |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $20-$30 | (3 courses, including drinks) |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $50-$70 | (upscale, 3-4 courses) |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $2-$3 | |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $4-$5 | |\n| Cappuccino | $2-$3 | |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $1-$2 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nWhen it comes to shopping for groceries, Kazakhstan offers a mix of modern supermarkets and traditional local markets.

The price difference between supermarkets and local markets can be significant, with local markets often offering better value for money. For example, a kilogram of apples can cost around $1.50 at a local market, compared to $2.50 at a supermarket.\n\nFor those looking to save money, local markets are the way to go. Not only do they offer fresh produce at lower prices, but they also provide an opportunity to experience the local culture and interact with vendors. However, be prepared to **haggle**, as bargaining is a common practice at local markets.
