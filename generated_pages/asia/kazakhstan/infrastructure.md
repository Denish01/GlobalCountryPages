[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Kazakhstan has been investing heavily in its infrastructure development, with a focus on improving the country's connectivity and economic competitiveness. The government has launched several initiatives to upgrade the country's roads, railways, and airports, as well as to increase access to electricity, water, and sanitation. However, despite these efforts, there remains a significant gap between urban and rural areas, with many rural communities still lacking access to basic services. The country's infrastructure development is also hindered by its vast territory and harsh climate, which can make it difficult and expensive to build and maintain infrastructure.

In recent years, Kazakhstan has made significant progress in developing its infrastructure, with the government investing billions of dollars in new projects. The country has also been actively promoting public-private partnerships to attract foreign investment and expertise. As a result, Kazakhstan's infrastructure is becoming increasingly modern and efficient, with new roads, railways, and airports being built to international standards. However, more needs to be done to address the urban-rural gap and to ensure that all communities have access to basic services.

Kazakhstan's infrastructure development is also closely tied to its economic development, with the government seeking to diversify the country's economy and reduce its dependence on oil exports. The development of new industries, such as manufacturing and tourism, will require significant investments in infrastructure, including roads, railways, and telecommunications networks. As a result, the government is prioritizing infrastructure development as a key driver of economic growth and competitiveness.
