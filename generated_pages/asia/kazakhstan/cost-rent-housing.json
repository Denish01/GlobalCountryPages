The rental market is relatively stable, with typical lease terms ranging from 6 to 12 months, and deposit requirements usually equivalent to one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected by law, with provisions for rent control and eviction procedures. Compared to its regional neighbors, Kazakhstan's housing costs are relatively moderate, with prices lower than in Russia and China, but higher than in Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan.\n\nThe government has implemented various initiatives to support the development of the housing sector, including subsidies for affordable housing and incentives for private sector investment. However, the market is still subject to fluctuations in the economy, particularly in the oil and gas sector, which can impact housing demand and prices. Additionally, the country's vast territory and regional disparities in economic development can result in significant variations in housing costs and availability across different regions.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $250-$400 | $150-$250 | Basic amenities, 20-30 sqm |\n| 1 Bedroom | $300-$500 | $200-$350 | Standard amenities, 40-60 sqm |\n| 2 Bedroom | $450-$700 | $300-$550 | Mid-range amenities, 70-100 sqm |\n| 3 Bedroom | $700-$1,200 | $500-$900 | High-end amenities, 120-150 sqm |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $1,500-$3,000 | Prime locations, modern apartments |\n| Suburbs | $800-$1,800 | Residential areas, older buildings |\n| Rural | $200-$500 | Limited amenities, traditional housing |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Diplomatic Town** in Astana: $400-$700 USD per month for a one-bedroom apartment, with modern amenities and a safe environment.\n- **Left Bank** in Astana: $300-$600 USD per month for a one-bedroom apartment, with a mix of old and new buildings, and easy access to the city center.\n- **Almaty City Center**: $250-$500 USD per month for a one-bedroom apartment, with a vibrant atmosphere and proximity to shops and restaurants.\n- **Turksib** in Almaty: $200-$400 USD per month for a one-bedroom apartment, with a more laid-back atmosphere and a mix of old and new housing.\n- **Nurly Zhol** in Astana: $350-$650 USD per month for a one-bedroom apartment, with modern amenities and a convenient location near the city's main attractions.\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Kazakhstan [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods thoroughly to find the best balance of price and quality.\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent to navigate the local market.\n- Be prepared to negotiate prices, particularly for longer-term leases.\n- Check the condition of the apartment and any necessary repairs before signing a lease.\n- Utilities such as heat, water, and electricity are usually included in the rent, but internet and TV may be extra.\n- Furnished apartments are less common, but can be found in some modern buildings and expat-friendly neighborhoods.",
