  "content": "The primary languages spoken in Kazakhstan are Kazakh and Russian, with Kazakh being the official language and Russian widely used as a lingua franca.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nOfficial Language(s): Kazakh, Russian\nWidely Spoken: English, German, Turkish\nEnglish Proficiency: Low\nScript: Cyrillic\nLanguage Family: Turkic\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]\nKazakhstan's linguistic landscape is characterized by the dominance of Kazakh and Russian, with other languages such as English, German, and Turkish also being spoken. The country's geography and history have contributed to the development of regional dialects, with the northern regions having a stronger Russian influence and the southern regions having a stronger Kazakh influence. Minority languages such as Uyghur, Uzbek, and Tajik are also spoken in various parts of the country. English is not widely understood, particularly outside of major cities like Astana and Almaty, and visitors may need to rely on Russian or Kazakh to communicate.\n\nThe use of language in Kazakhstan is closely tied to the country's cultural and social context. For example, Kazakh is often used in formal situations and official government business, while Russian is more commonly used in informal settings and in business. The country's language policy has also been influenced by its history as a former Soviet republic, with Russian having been the dominant language during the Soviet era. Today, the Kazakh government is working to promote the use of Kazakh as the primary language, while also recognizing the importance of Russian and other languages in the country's linguistic landscape.\n\nDespite the challenges of communicating in Kazakhstan, visitors can still get by with some basic knowledge of Kazakh and Russian phrases. Many younger Kazakhs and those in the tourism industry are learning English, and some restaurants and hotels may have English-speaking staff. However, it is still a good idea for visitors to learn some basic phrases in Kazakh and Russian to help navigate everyday situations.\n\n[SECTION] Essential Phrases [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| English | Local Language | Pronunciation | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hello | Сәлем (Kazakh), Здравствуйте (Russian) | sa-lem, zdrah-stvooy-tye | formal |\n| Thank you | Рахмет (Kazakh), Спасибо (Russian) | rakh-met, spa-see-bah |  |\n| Please | Өтінемін (Kazakh), Пожалуйста (Russian) | oh-tee-neh-meen, pah-zhahl-stah |  |\n| Yes / No | Иә (Kazakh), Да/Нет (Russian) | ee-ah, dah/nyet |  |\n| Excuse me | Кешіріңіз (Kazakh), Извините (Russian) | keh-shee-reeng-ez, eez-vee-nee-tay |  |\n| How much? | Қанша?
