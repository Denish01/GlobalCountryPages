The tax system in Kazakhstan is administered by the State Revenue Committee, which is responsible for collecting taxes, enforcing tax laws, and providing tax services to taxpayers. The tax year in Kazakhstan runs from January 1 to December 31, and taxpayers are required to file their tax returns and pay any taxes due by April 31 of the following year.
