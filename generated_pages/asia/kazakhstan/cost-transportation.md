Kazakhstan is a vast country with a diverse range of transportation options, including public buses, minibuses, taxis, and ride-hailing services. The quality of public transit varies greatly between cities, with larger cities like Almaty and Astana having more comprehensive and reliable systems. Most people in Kazakhstan get around using public transportation, with buses and minibuses being the most affordable options. However, the use of private cars is becoming increasingly popular, especially in urban areas.

In general, the transportation infrastructure in Kazakhstan is well-developed, with a network of roads, railways, and airports connecting major cities and towns.
