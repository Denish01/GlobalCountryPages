[SECTION] How Kazakhstan Is Divided [/SECTION]
Kazakhstan is divided into 14 provinces, also known as oblys, and 3 cities with special status. The provinces are further divided into districts, which are then divided into villages and towns. The 3 cities with special status, Almaty, Astana, and Baikonur, are not part of any province and are directly under the central government. This administrative structure allows for efficient governance and management of the country's vast territory.

The 14 provinces of Kazakhstan are Akmola, Aktobe, Almaty, Atyrau, East Kazakhstan, Karaganda, Kostanay, Kyzylorda, Mangystau, North Kazakhstan, Pavlodar, South Kazakhstan, West Kazakhstan, and Zhambyl. Each province has its own capital city and is responsible for managing local affairs, such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure development. The central government, on the other hand, is responsible for national policies, foreign affairs, and defense.
