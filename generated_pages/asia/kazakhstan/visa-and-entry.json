[/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nKazakhstan has a moderate visa policy, allowing citizens of certain countries to enter visa-free or obtain a visa on arrival. The country has been working to liberalize its visa regime in recent years, making it easier for tourists and business travelers to visit. Currently, citizens of over 60 countries can enter Kazakhstan without a visa, including those from the European Union, the United States, and Japan. However, the length of stay and requirements for registration vary depending on nationality.\n\nThe visa policy of Kazakhstan is designed to facilitate travel and trade while ensuring national security. The country has introduced an electronic visa system, which allows eligible citizens to apply for a visa online and receive it via email. This system has streamlined the application process and reduced processing times. Additionally, Kazakhstan has introduced a visa-free regime for transit passengers, allowing them to stay in the country for up to 72 hours without a visa.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | No | Visa-free | 30 days | Registration required after 5 days |\n| UK Citizens | No | Visa-free | 30 days | Registration required after 5 days |\n| EU Citizens | No | Visa-free | 30 days | Registration required after 5 days |\n| Canadian Citizens | No | Visa-free | 30 days | Registration required after 5 days |\n| Australian Citizens | No | Visa-free | 30 days | Registration required after 5 days |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | eVisa | 30 days | Must apply online in advance |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Visa required | 30 days | Must apply at a Kazakh embassy or consulate |\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can enter Kazakhstan visa-free for up to 30 days, depending on their nationality.
