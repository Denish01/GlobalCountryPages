[SECTION] Overview: Kazakhstan vs Turkmenistan [/SECTION]
Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan are two neighboring countries in Central Asia with distinct economic profiles. Kazakhstan has a more diversified economy, with a strong focus on oil and gas production, while Turkmenistan's economy is largely driven by its vast natural gas reserves. In terms of cost of living, Kazakhstan tends to be cheaper than Turkmenistan, particularly when it comes to housing, food, and transportation. However, the cost difference is not drastic, and both countries offer a relatively affordable lifestyle compared to other parts of the world. Kazakhstan's larger economy and more developed infrastructure also contribute to its slightly lower cost of living.

The economic context of both countries plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. Kazakhstan's economy has been growing steadily over the years, with a GDP growth rate of around 4-5% per annum. In contrast, Turkmenistan's economy has been more volatile, with a significant decline in GDP growth in recent years due to the drop in global energy prices. This has led to a decrease in the purchasing power of the local currency, making imports more expensive and contributing to higher prices for certain goods and services. As a result, Kazakhstan is generally around 15-20% cheaper than Turkmenistan, making it a more attractive option for expats, students, and retirees looking for an affordable lifestyle.
