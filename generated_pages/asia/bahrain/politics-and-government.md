[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Bahrain operates under a constitutional monarchy framework, where the King serves as the head of state and the Prime Minister as the head of government. The system is designed to provide a balance of power between the monarch, the legislative body, and the judicial system. The **separation of powers** is a key principle, with each branch having distinct roles and responsibilities. Bahrain's political system is unitary, with a centralized government overseeing the entire country.

The National Assembly, the legislative body, is composed of two chambers: the Council of Representatives and the Consultative Council. The Council of Representatives is elected by the people, while the Consultative Council is appointed by the King. This bicameral system allows for representation of the people's interests, as well as input from appointed experts and advisors. The **Shura Council**, or Consultative Council, plays a crucial role in advising the government on key policy issues.

Bahrain's **Constitution**, adopted in 2002, outlines the framework of the government and the relationship between the branches. It establishes the principles of **democracy**, **human rights**, and the **rule of law**, providing a foundation for the country's governance structure. The Constitution also enshrines the role of **Sharia law** in the country's legal system, ensuring that Islamic principles are integrated into the legislation and governance of the country.
