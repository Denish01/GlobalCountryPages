The quality of public transit is generally good, with frequent bus services and affordable fares. Most people in Bahrain get around using their own vehicles, but public transportation is a viable option for those without cars. The country's small size and relatively low traffic congestion make it easy to navigate, and the government has invested heavily in improving the road network and public transportation infrastructure.\n\nThe main transportation modes in Bahrain are buses, taxis, and private vehicles. The public bus network is extensive, with routes covering most areas of the country, and buses are generally clean and well-maintained. Taxis are also widely available, and ride-hailing services have become increasingly popular in recent years. For those who prefer to drive, the road network is well-developed, and fuel is relatively cheap, with gasoline costing around $0.60 USD per liter.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.50 | $30 | Comprehensive coverage, frequent services |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available in Bahrain |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $1.00 | N/A | Limited routes, mostly used for short trips |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available in Bahrain |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $2.50 | $0.50 | $5-10 | Widely available, but may not always use meter |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $2.00 | $0.30 | $3-6 | Talabat and Careem are popular options |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $10-20 | To city center, depending on traffic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $0.60 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $0.50 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-60 | Economy car, depending on rental company |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-2 | Limited parking options in city center |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $1-5 | Limited toll roads, mostly on highways |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-20 | Limited options, mostly to Saudi Arabia and Qatar |\n| Domestic Flight | $50-100 | Limited routes, mostly to other Gulf countries |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available in Bahrain |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider using public buses or ride-hailing services instead of taxis.\n- Download the Talabat or Careem app to book ride-hailing services.\n- Always negotiate the fare with taxi drivers before starting your journey, as they may not always use the meter.\n- Be aware of peak hour traffic, especially during rush hour, and plan your journey accordingly.\n- Consider renting a car for longer trips or for exploring the countryside, as public transportation options may be limited.\n- Always wear a seatbelt and follow local traffic rules to ensure your safety on the road.",
