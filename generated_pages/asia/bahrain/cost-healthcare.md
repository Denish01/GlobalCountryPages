[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Bahrain has a mixed healthcare system, with both public and private healthcare providers offering a range of services. The public healthcare system is generally of high quality and is available to all citizens, with foreigners also able to access these services, although they may need to pay out-of-pocket. The private healthcare system in Bahrain is also of high quality, with many modern and well-equipped hospitals and clinics, and is often preferred by expats and those who can afford it. In general, the public healthcare system is more affordable, but may have longer waiting times and less availability of specialized care, while the private system is more expensive but offers faster access to specialized care and more amenities.

The healthcare system in Bahrain works differently for locals and foreigners, with citizens generally having access to free or low-cost public healthcare, while foreigners may need to pay out-of-pocket or have private insurance to cover their medical expenses. It is recommended that foreigners have some form of health insurance to cover their medical expenses, as out-of-pocket costs can be high. Many employers in Bahrain offer health insurance as part of their employment packages, but individuals may also need to purchase their own insurance to cover their specific needs.
