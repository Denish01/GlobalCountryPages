[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Bahrain has a **hot desert climate**, with very little rainfall throughout the year. The country experiences two main seasons: a **hot summer** from April to October and a **mild winter** from November to March. The summer months are characterized by extremely high temperatures, often reaching 40°C (104°F), while the winter months are mild, with average temperatures ranging from 15°C (59°F) to 25°C (77°F). The best time to visit Bahrain is during the winter months, when the weather is pleasant and ideal for sightseeing and outdoor activities.

The **dry season** in Bahrain lasts from November to March, with minimal rainfall and low humidity. This period is ideal for tourists, as the weather is comfortable, and outdoor activities such as visiting historical sites, going to the beach, and taking part in water sports can be enjoyed. On the other hand, the **wet season**, which occurs from April to October, is characterized by extremely hot weather, with temperatures often reaching 45°C (113°F) in the summer months. This period is not ideal for tourists, as the heat can be unbearable, and outdoor activities may be limited.

The seasons in Bahrain also affect travel, as the peak tourist season coincides with the winter months. During this time, popular tourist destinations such as the **Bahrain Fort**, the **Al Fateh Grand Mosque**, and the **Bahrain National Museum** can be crowded, and prices for accommodations and tourist services may be higher. On the other hand, the summer months are considered the low season, and tourists can enjoy lower prices and fewer crowds, but the heat may be a significant drawback.
