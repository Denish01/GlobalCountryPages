The public healthcare system is generally of high quality and is available to all citizens, with foreigners also able to access these services, although they may need to pay out-of-pocket. The private healthcare system in Bahrain is also of high quality, with many modern and well-equipped hospitals and clinics, and is often preferred by expats and those who can afford it. In general, the public healthcare system is more affordable, but may have longer waiting times and less availability of specialized care, while the private system is more expensive but offers faster access to specialized care and more amenities.\n\nThe healthcare system in Bahrain works differently for locals and foreigners, with citizens generally having access to free or low-cost public healthcare, while foreigners may need to pay out-of-pocket or have private insurance to cover their medical expenses. It is recommended that foreigners have some form of health insurance to cover their medical expenses, as out-of-pocket costs can be high. Many employers in Bahrain offer health insurance as part of their employment packages, but individuals may also need to purchase their own insurance to cover their specific needs.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | |\n| Specialist Consultation | $50-$100 | $100-$200 | |\n| Dental Checkup | $30-$70 | $70-$150 | |\n| Eye Exam | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $100-$500 | |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $200-$1,000 | |\n| Basic Surgery | $1,000-$5,000 | |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,500-$3,000 | |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | |\n| X-Ray | $50-$200 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, basic procedures |\n| Comprehensive Private | $200-$500 | Specialist care, advanced procedures, hospital stays |\n| International / Expat | $500-$1,000 | Global coverage, emergency evacuation, comprehensive care |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Common medications such as pain relievers and antibiotics can cost between $5-$20 per prescription\n- Prescription medications can only be purchased with a valid prescription from a licensed doctor\n- Pharmacies are widely available in Bahrain, with many located in shopping malls and near hospitals\n- Over-the-counter medications are also widely available, but may require a prescription for certain types of medication\n- The cost of medications can vary depending on the type and brand, with generic versions often being cheaper\n- Some pharmacies may offer discounts or loyalty programs for frequent customers\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is best to call the emergency number 999, which will connect you to the local ambulance service.
