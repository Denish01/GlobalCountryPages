[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Bahrain's rental market is relatively stable, with a moderate demand for housing due to the country's growing expat population and limited supply of new developments. Typical lease terms in Bahrain range from 12 to 24 months, with a security deposit equivalent to one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected under Bahraini law, which requires landlords to provide a written contract and maintain the property's condition. Compared to its regional neighbors, such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar, Bahrain's housing costs are relatively affordable, although still higher than in some other parts of the Middle East.

The Bahraini government has implemented various initiatives to regulate the housing market and protect tenants' rights, including the establishment of a rent control system and a tenant-landlord dispute resolution mechanism. Despite these efforts, the housing market in Bahrain remains competitive, and renters should be prepared to act quickly when finding a suitable property. Additionally, the country's high **GDP per capita** and low **inflation rate** contribute to a relatively stable economic environment, which can impact the housing market.
