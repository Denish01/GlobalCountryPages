However, the **inflation rate** in Bahrain is relatively low, at 0.9% in 2024, which helps to keep food prices stable. The eating-out culture in Bahrain is popular, with many restaurants and cafes offering a wide range of international cuisines. On the other hand, home cooking is also common, with many locals preferring to prepare traditional Bahraini dishes such as **machboos** (a rice dish with meat or fish) and **umu ali** (a dessert made with puff pastry and nuts).\n\nThe high **GDP per capita PPP** of $66,941 in 2024 indicates a strong economy, which contributes to the high demand for premium food products and dining experiences. Additionally, the **health expenditure per capita** of $1,176 in 2023 and **out-of-pocket health spend** of 28.7% in 2023 may influence food choices, with some individuals opting for healthier and more expensive options. Despite these factors, Bahrain offers a wide range of affordable food options, from street food to mid-range restaurants, making it possible for visitors and locals to enjoy a variety of cuisines without breaking the bank.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $1.50 | 0.570 BHD | |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $1.20 | 0.450 BHD | |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $2.50 | 0.950 BHD | |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $2.00 | 0.750 BHD | |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $6.00 | 2.250 BHD | |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $10.00 | 3.750 BHD | |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $3.00 | 1.125 BHD | |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $2.50 | 0.950 BHD | |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $1.50 | 0.570 BHD | |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $1.00 | 0.375 BHD | |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $8.00 | 3.000 BHD | |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $1.00 | 0.375 BHD | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $5-$10 | (typical dishes such as shawarma or falafel) |\n| Casual Restaurant | $15-$30 | (one person, international cuisine) |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $30-$50 | (3 courses, mid-range restaurant) |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $100-$150 | (upscale, 3 courses) |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $5-$7 | |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $8-$10 | |\n| Cappuccino | $3-$5 | |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $1-$2 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nThe prices of groceries in Bahrain can vary significantly depending on whether you shop at a supermarket or a local market. Supermarkets tend to offer a wider range of products, including imported goods, but at a higher price. Local markets, on the other hand, offer fresh produce and traditional products at lower prices. For example, a kilogram of **apples** can cost $3.00 USD at a supermarket, but only $2.00 USD at a local market. It's worth noting that local markets often require **bargaining**, which can be a fun and interactive experience, but may not be suitable for all visitors.\n\nWhen shopping at local markets, it's a good idea to **haggle** over prices, especially when buying in bulk. Additionally, local markets often offer a wide range of **fresh produce**, including fruits, vegetables, and herbs, which can be a great way to experience the local cuisine. On the other hand, supermarkets offer a wider range of **imported products**, including international brands and specialty items. Ultimately, the choice between supermarkets and local markets depends on your personal preferences and budget.\n\n[SECTION] Local Food Tips [/SECTION]\n- The cheapest way to eat in Bahrain is to try **street food**, such as shawarma or falafel, which can cost as little as $5 USD per meal.\n- **Local staples** such as rice, bread, and eggs are generally affordable and can be a good value.\n- **Machboos** is a traditional Bahraini dish made with rice and meat or fish, and is often served at local restaurants and homes.\n- It's a good idea to **avoid buying imported products**, as they can be expensive and may not be as fresh as local alternatives.\n- **Bargaining** is a common practice at local markets, so be prepared to haggle over prices.\n- **Tipping** is not expected, but is appreciated for good service, especially at restaurants and cafes.",
