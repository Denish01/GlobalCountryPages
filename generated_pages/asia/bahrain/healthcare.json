  "content": "Healthcare in Bahrain is a well-developed system that offers a high standard of medical care, with both public and private facilities available to cater to the needs of its population and visitors.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Universal/Mixed\nQuality Rating: High\nEmergency Number: 999\nHospital Standard: Excellent\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: widespread\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nBahrain's healthcare system is a mix of public and private providers, with the government playing a significant role in regulating and funding the sector. The public healthcare system is generally free for citizens, while expatriates and visitors often rely on private healthcare providers. The quality of care in Bahrain is considered to be high, with many medical professionals trained in the UK, US, or other Western countries. Urban areas, such as the capital Manama, have better access to healthcare facilities and specialized care, while rural areas may have more limited options. However, the government has made efforts to improve healthcare access in rural areas, with the establishment of primary healthcare centers and clinics.\n\nThe public healthcare system in Bahrain is well-organized, with a network of hospitals, clinics, and health centers providing a range of services, from primary care to specialized treatments. The Salmaniya Medical Complex, for example, is a major public hospital that offers a wide range of medical services, including emergency care, surgery, and maternity care. Private healthcare providers, on the other hand, offer a more personalized and often quicker service, but at a higher cost. Many private hospitals and clinics in Bahrain are accredited by international organizations, such as the Joint Commission International (JCI), and offer high-quality care to patients.\n\nDespite the overall high standard of healthcare in Bahrain, there are some challenges, such as long waiting times in public hospitals and a shortage of certain medical specialties. However, the government has implemented various initiatives to address these issues, including the development of a national health strategy and the establishment of a healthcare regulatory authority.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Salmaniya Medical Complex | Manama | Public | Emergency, surgery, maternity | Yes |\n| Bahrain Specialist Hospital | Manama | Private | Cardiology, oncology, orthopedics | Yes |\n| International Hospital of Bahrain | Manama | Private | General medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics | Yes |\n| American Mission Hospital | Manama | Private | General medicine, surgery, emergency | Yes |\n| Bahrain Royal Hospital | Riffa | Private | General medicine, surgery, maternity | Yes |\n| Ibn Al-Nafees Hospital | Manama | Private | General medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics | Yes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Private health insurance** is recommended for expatriates and visitors, as it provides access to private healthcare facilities and services.\n- **Local insurance options** are available, such as the Bahrain National Health Insurance Scheme, which provides coverage for citizens and expatriates.\n- **International health insurance** is also available, which can provide coverage for medical expenses incurred in Bahrain and other countries.\n- **Expatriate health insurance** is often required by employers, and can provide comprehensive coverage for medical expenses, including evacuation and repatriation.\n- **Cost of health insurance** varies depending on the provider, level of coverage, and individual circumstances, but can range from 500 to 2,000 BHD per year.\n- **Group health insurance** is often available for companies and organizations, which can provide coverage for employees and their families.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Medications** are widely available in Bahrain, with many pharmacies located throughout the country, including 24-hour pharmacies in major cities.\n- **Prescription requirements** vary depending on the medication, but many medications are available over-the-counter.\n- **Common brands** of medications are available, including international brands such as Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline.\n- **Cost of medications** can vary depending on the medication and pharmacy, but many medications are subsidized by the government.\n- **Pharmacy access** is widespread, with many pharmacies located in urban and rural areas, making it easy to access medications and healthcare services.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Required vaccinations** for travel to Bahrain include hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and typhoid fever.\n- **Recommended vaccinations** include MMR, diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis.\n- **Endemic diseases** in Bahrain include tuberculosis, malaria, and sandfly fever.\n- **Water safety** is generally good, with tap water being safe to drink in most areas.\n- **Food safety** is also generally good, with many restaurants and food establishments following high standards of hygiene and food handling.\n- **Heat-related illnesses** can be a risk, especially during the summer months, so it is essential to stay hydrated and take precautions to avoid heat stroke.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **Medical tourism** is a growing industry in Bahrain, with many patients traveling to the country for medical procedures such as orthopedic surgery, cosmetic surgery, and fertility treatment.\n- **Popular procedures** include knee replacement, hip replacement, and cataract surgery.\n- **Accredited hospitals** include the Bahrain Specialist Hospital and the International Hospital of Bahrain, which have been accredited by international organizations such as the JCI.\n- **Cost savings** can be significant, with many medical procedures costing less in Bahrain than in other countries.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- **Emergency number** is 999, which can be used to call for an ambulance or report a medical emergency.\n- **Ambulance reliability** is generally good, with many ambulances being equipped with modern medical equipment and staffed by trained paramedics.\n- **Nearest hospitals** can be found by calling the emergency number or searching online, and many hospitals have 24-hour emergency departments.\n- **Insurance claims** can be made by contacting the insurance provider, and many hospitals and clinics have relationships with insurance companies to facilitate claims.\n- **Medical evacuation** may be necessary in some cases, and can be arranged through insurance providers or private companies.",
