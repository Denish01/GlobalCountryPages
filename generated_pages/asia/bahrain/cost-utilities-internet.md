[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Bahrain has a well-developed utility infrastructure, with a reliable supply of electricity, water, and gas. The cost of utilities in Bahrain is generally stable, with minimal fluctuations throughout the year. However, there can be some seasonal variation in electricity costs, with higher rates during the summer months (June to September) due to increased air conditioning usage. The Bahraini government has implemented measures to reduce energy consumption and promote sustainability, which may impact utility costs in the long term.

The quality of utility services in Bahrain is generally high, with most residents having access to modern amenities such as air conditioning, heating, and garbage collection. The Electricity and Water Authority (EWA) is the primary provider of electricity and water services in Bahrain, and it offers a range of tariffs and payment plans to suit different customer needs. However, some residents may experience occasional power outages or water disruptions, particularly during periods of high demand or maintenance.
