[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Food prices in Bahrain are generally higher compared to other countries in the region, due to the country's reliance on imports and high demand for premium products. However, the **inflation rate** in Bahrain is relatively low, at 0.9% in 2024, which helps to keep food prices stable. The eating-out culture in Bahrain is popular, with many restaurants and cafes offering a wide range of international cuisines. On the other hand, home cooking is also common, with many locals preferring to prepare traditional Bahraini dishes such as **machboos** (a rice dish with meat or fish) and **umu ali** (a dessert made with puff pastry and nuts).

The high **GDP per capita PPP** of $66,941 in 2024 indicates a strong economy, which contributes to the high demand for premium food products and dining experiences. Additionally, the **health expenditure per capita** of $1,176 in 2023 and **out-of-pocket health spend** of 28.7% in 2023 may influence food choices, with some individuals opting for healthier and more expensive options. Despite these factors, Bahrain offers a wide range of affordable food options, from street food to mid-range restaurants, making it possible for visitors and locals to enjoy a variety of cuisines without breaking the bank.
