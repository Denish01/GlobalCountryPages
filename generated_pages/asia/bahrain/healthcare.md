[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Bahrain's healthcare system is a mix of public and private providers, with the government playing a significant role in regulating and funding the sector. The public healthcare system is generally free for citizens, while expatriates and visitors often rely on private healthcare providers. The quality of care in Bahrain is considered to be high, with many medical professionals trained in the UK, US, or other Western countries. Urban areas, such as the capital Manama, have better access to healthcare facilities and specialized care, while rural areas may have more limited options. However, the government has made efforts to improve healthcare access in rural areas, with the establishment of primary healthcare centers and clinics.

The public healthcare system in Bahrain is well-organized, with a network of hospitals, clinics, and health centers providing a range of services, from primary care to specialized treatments. The Salmaniya Medical Complex, for example, is a major public hospital that offers a wide range of medical services, including emergency care, surgery, and maternity care. Private healthcare providers, on the other hand, offer a more personalized and often quicker service, but at a higher cost. Many private hospitals and clinics in Bahrain are accredited by international organizations, such as the Joint Commission International (JCI), and offer high-quality care to patients.

Despite the overall high standard of healthcare in Bahrain, there are some challenges, such as long waiting times in public hospitals and a shortage of certain medical specialties. However, the government has implemented various initiatives to address these issues, including the development of a national health strategy and the establishment of a healthcare regulatory authority.
