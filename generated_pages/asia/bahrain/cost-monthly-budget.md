[SECTION] Cost of Living Overview [/SECTION]
Bahrain's high GDP per capita of $66,941 suggests a relatively high cost of living, with prices comparable to those in neighboring Saudi Arabia and Qatar. However, the country's small size and limited geographical scope mean that prices can vary significantly depending on the location and lifestyle. A budget of $1,500 per month can provide a basic but comfortable lifestyle, while $2,000 per month can offer a mid-range lifestyle with some luxuries. In contrast, a comfortable lifestyle with plenty of disposable income would require around $2,500 per month.

The cost of living in Bahrain is generally higher than in some other countries in the region, but it is still possible to find affordable options, especially outside of the capital city, Manama. Compared to Qatar, Bahrain's cost of living is slightly lower, while Saudi Arabia's cost of living can vary greatly depending on the location. Overall, Bahrain offers a unique blend of traditional Arabic culture and modern amenities, making it an attractive destination for expats and tourists alike.
