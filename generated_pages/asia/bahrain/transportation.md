[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Bahrain International Airport (BAH) is the main entry point for most travelers, with direct flights from major hubs in the Middle East, Europe, and Asia. The airport is located about 7 kilometers northeast of the capital city Manama, and it's a major hub for Gulf Air, the national carrier of Bahrain. You can also enter Bahrain by land or sea, with the King Fahd Causeway connecting the country to Saudi Arabia, and several ferry services operating from nearby countries. 

If you're traveling from neighboring countries, you can take a bus or drive to Bahrain, with several bus companies operating from cities like Dubai and Abu Dhabi in the UAE, as well as from Riyadh and Dammam in Saudi Arabia. The border crossing can be busy, especially during peak travel seasons, so be sure to plan ahead and allow plenty of time to clear customs and immigration. Additionally, Bahrain has a relatively straightforward visa policy, with citizens of many countries eligible for a visa on arrival or an electronic visa.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Bahrain has a limited domestic air network, with most flights connecting the capital city Manama to other nearby countries rather than domestic destinations. However, you can fly from Bahrain International Airport to several nearby cities in the Gulf region, including Doha in Qatar, Dubai and Abu Dhabi in the UAE, and Kuwait City in Kuwait. Gulf Air is the main carrier operating these routes, with several flights per day to each destination. Booking in advance is recommended, especially during peak travel seasons, and you can expect to pay around $100-$200 for a one-way ticket.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Bahrain does not have a rail network, so you won't be able to take a train to get around the country. However, there are plans to develop a rail network in the future, with a proposed link to Saudi Arabia and other neighboring countries. For now, you'll need to rely on other forms of transportation, such as buses, taxis, or rental cars, to get around Bahrain.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Bahrain has a relatively well-developed bus network, with several companies operating intercity routes to destinations like Riyadh and Dammam in Saudi Arabia, as well as to nearby cities in the UAE. The buses are generally comfortable and modern, with air conditioning and other amenities, and the fares are relatively affordable, with a one-way ticket costing around $10-$20. You can book your ticket in advance at the bus station or through a local travel agent, and be sure to arrive early to secure a seat.
