# The Truth About Georgia - History & Real Facts

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
Georgia, a sovereign country located in Asia, has a rich and complex history that spans over 3,000 years. The territory has been inhabited since the Paleolithic era, with archaeological evidence showing human presence dating back to the Stone Age. The ancient Georgian kingdoms of Colchis and Iberia were established in the 13th century BC, with the latter being a major center of trade and culture in the ancient world. In the 4th century AD, Georgia adopted **Christianity** as its official religion, which has had a profound impact on the country's culture and identity.

In the 11th century, Georgia experienced a golden age under the rule of King **David IV**, who united the country and established a strong, centralized government. However, this period of prosperity was short-lived, as Georgia was invaded by various empires, including the **Mongols**, **Turks**, and **Persians**. In the 19th century, Georgia was annexed by the **Russian Empire**, which had a significant impact on the country's language, culture, and economy. Following the Russian Revolution, Georgia declared its independence in 1918, but was later annexed by the **Soviet Union** in 1921.

Georgia gained its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, following a long and tumultuous process. The country has since been working to establish a stable, democratic government and economy. Despite facing numerous challenges, including a conflict with Russia in 2008, Georgia has made significant progress in recent years, with a growing economy and a strengthening of its international relationships.

The country's history has been marked by a complex interplay of cultures, with various empires and dynasties leaving their mark on the territory. Today, Georgia is a unique blend of traditional and modern, with a strong sense of national identity and a deep connection to its rich cultural heritage.
