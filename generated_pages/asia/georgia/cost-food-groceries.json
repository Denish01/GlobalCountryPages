The country's strategic location at the crossroads of Europe and Asia has influenced its cuisine, with a mix of traditional and modern dishes available. Eating out is a popular culture in Georgia, with many restaurants, cafes, and street food stalls offering a wide range of options. However, home cooking is also common, with many locals preferring to prepare traditional dishes at home using fresh ingredients from local markets. The low inflation rate of 1.1% in 2024 has helped keep food prices stable, making it easier for locals and tourists to enjoy the country's culinary delights.\n\nThe cost of food in Georgia is driven by several factors, including the country's agricultural production, imports, and transportation costs. The country is self-sufficient in producing many staple foods, such as bread, dairy products, and vegetables, which helps keep prices low. However, imported goods, such as meat and luxury items, can be more expensive. The eating-out culture in Georgia is also influenced by the country's tourism industry, with many restaurants catering to tourists and offering a range of international dishes. Overall, Georgia offers a unique and affordable food experience, with a mix of traditional and modern cuisine available at reasonable prices.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $0.80-1.20 | 2.50-3.50 GEL | |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $0.50-1.00 | 1.50-3.00 GEL | |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $1.20-2.00 | 3.50-6.00 GEL | |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $1.50-2.50 | 4.50-7.50 GEL | |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $3.00-5.00 | 9.00-15.00 GEL | |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $5.00-8.00 | 15.00-24.00 GEL | |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $1.00-2.00 | 3.00-6.00 GEL | |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $1.00-2.00 | 3.00-6.00 GEL | |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $0.50-1.00 | 1.50-3.00 GEL | |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $0.50-1.00 | 1.50-3.00 GEL | |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $5.00-8.00 | 15.00-24.00 GEL | |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $0.50-1.00 | 1.50-3.00 GEL | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $3-5 | (khinkali, khachapuri, lobio) |\n| Casual Restaurant | $10-15 | (one person, traditional dishes) |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $20-30 | (3 courses, wine) |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $50-70 | (upscale, international cuisine) |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $2-3 | |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $4-5 | |\n| Cappuccino | $2-3 | |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $1-2 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nThe prices of groceries in Georgia can vary significantly depending on whether you shop at a supermarket or a local market. Supermarkets tend to offer a wider range of products, including imported goods, but at higher prices. Local markets, on the other hand, offer fresh produce, meat, and dairy products at lower prices, but with a more limited selection. For example, a kilogram of apples can cost around $1.50 at a local market, while the same item can cost around $2.50 at a supermarket. It's worth noting that local markets often offer better value for money, especially for staple foods, but may require some bargaining and negotiation.\n\nWhen shopping at local markets, it's essential to be prepared to haggle and negotiate prices. Vendors often expect customers to bargain, and it's not uncommon to see prices reduced by 10-20% after some negotiation. Supermarkets, on the other hand, tend to have fixed prices, and bargaining is not expected. It's also worth noting that local markets often offer a more authentic and immersive experience, with the opportunity to interact with locals and learn about the country's culture and traditions.\n\n[SECTION] Local Food Tips [/SECTION]\n- Eating at local eateries and street food stalls is a great way to try traditional dishes at affordable prices.\n- Khinkali (dumplings) and khachapuri (cheese bread) are popular and affordable traditional dishes.\n- Local markets offer a wide range of fresh produce, meat, and dairy products at lower prices than supermarkets.\n- Bargaining is expected at local markets, so be prepared to negotiate prices.\n- Imported goods, such as meat and luxury items, can be more expensive than local alternatives.\n- Trying local wine and beer is a great way to experience the country's culinary culture, with prices starting from around $2-3 USD for a glass of wine or a beer.",
