  "content": "The infrastructure in Georgia is relatively well-developed, with ongoing investments and improvements in the transportation, energy, and telecommunications sectors, although there are still significant gaps between urban and rural areas.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 100% of population\nInternet Penetration: 49%\nRoad Network: 20,300 km, moderate quality with some paved and unpaved sections\nRail Network: 1,323 km\nMajor Airports: 3\nMajor Ports: 2, with 1 major port on the Black Sea\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nGeorgia's infrastructure has undergone significant development in recent years, with a focus on improving the country's transportation network, energy sector, and telecommunications systems. The government has invested heavily in upgrading the country's roads, railways, and airports, with a view to increasing trade and tourism. However, there is still a significant gap between urban and rural areas, with many rural communities lacking access to basic services such as reliable electricity, clean water, and sanitation. The country's infrastructure development is also hindered by its mountainous terrain, which makes it difficult and expensive to build and maintain roads, bridges, and other infrastructure.\n\nDespite these challenges, Georgia has made significant progress in recent years, with the country's infrastructure ranking improving significantly in various global indices. The government has also launched several initiatives aimed at promoting private sector investment in infrastructure, including the creation of a dedicated infrastructure investment fund. These efforts are expected to continue in the coming years, with a focus on improving the country's competitiveness and attractiveness to foreign investors.\n\nThe country's infrastructure development is also closely tied to its regional integration efforts, with Georgia seeking to strengthen its economic ties with neighboring countries and improve its connectivity to European and Asian markets. The country's strategic location at the crossroads of Europe and Asia makes it an important transit country for trade and energy, and its infrastructure development is critical to realizing its full potential as a regional hub.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 20,300 km | Moderate | Some paved and unpaved sections, with ongoing upgrading and maintenance works |\n| Railways | 1,323 km | Good | Electrified and non-electrified sections, with ongoing modernization efforts |\n| Airports | 3 international, 2 domestic | Good | Tbilisi International Airport is the main hub, with direct flights to major European and Asian cities |\n| Ports | 2 major | Moderate | The port of Poti is the largest, with ongoing expansion and modernization works |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- The country's power generation mix is dominated by **hydroelectric power**, which accounts for over 80% of total generation capacity.\n- The reliability of the electricity supply is generally good, with some occasional **outages** during peak summer months.\n- The government has launched several initiatives aimed at promoting **renewable energy** development, including wind and solar power.\n- The country's energy sector is also being supported by international organizations, including the **European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD)**.\n- Georgia is also exploring the possibility of importing **natural gas** from neighboring countries to diversify its energy mix.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- The safety of **tap water** is generally good in urban areas, but can be a concern in rural areas where water treatment facilities are limited.\n- **Sanitation coverage** is relatively high, with over 90% of the population having access to improved sanitation facilities.\n- **Water access** in rural areas is a significant challenge, with many communities relying on wells, springs, and other traditional sources.\n- The government has launched several initiatives aimed at improving **water supply and sanitation** services, including the construction of new water treatment plants and sewage systems.\n- International organizations, including the **World Bank**, are also providing support to the country's water and sanitation sector.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is generally good, with over 90% of the population having access to mobile phone services.\n- **Fiber-optic and broadband** internet services are available in major cities, but can be limited in rural areas.\n- The country's **4G/5G rollout** is ongoing, with several mobile operators already offering high-speed mobile internet services.\n- **Postal services** are provided by the Georgian Post, which offers a range of services including mail delivery, parcel delivery, and money transfer.\n- The government has also launched several initiatives aimed at promoting **e-government** and **digitalization**, including the creation of online platforms for public services and information.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The construction of the **Baku-Tbilisi-Kars (BTK) railway** is a major ongoing project, which will improve rail connectivity between Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Turkey.\n- The **Tbilisi Transport Company** is implementing a major project to upgrade the city's public transport system, including the introduction of new buses and metro lines.\n- The government has also launched several initiatives aimed at promoting **tourism development**, including the construction of new hotels, resorts, and tourist infrastructure.\n- The **European Union (EU)** is providing significant funding and technical support to Georgia's infrastructure development, including the construction of new roads, bridges, and energy facilities.\n- The **Asian Development Bank (ADB)** is also providing support to the country's infrastructure development, including the construction of new transport and energy infrastructure.",
