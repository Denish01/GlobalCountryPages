  "content": "In Georgia, healthcare costs vary significantly between public and private facilities, with the average health expenditure per capita being around $554, and out-of-pocket expenses accounting for approximately 58.8% of total health spending.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $554\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 58.8%\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 112\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: GEL\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nGeorgia's healthcare system is a mixed model, combining both public and private providers. Public healthcare facilities are generally less expensive, but the quality of care can be inconsistent, with some hospitals lacking modern equipment and trained staff. In contrast, private hospitals and clinics offer higher-quality care, but at a significantly higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is generally accessible, but foreigners may find it more challenging to navigate, and private insurance is often recommended. The system works on a fee-for-service basis, with patients paying out-of-pocket for most medical services, although some public facilities may offer subsidized care for certain conditions.\n\nThe quality of healthcare in Georgia varies significantly depending on the location and type of facility. In major cities like Tbilisi, there are modern private hospitals with well-trained staff and up-to-date equipment, while in rural areas, medical facilities may be more basic. For foreigners, it is often recommended to seek private medical care, as the quality of care is generally higher, and communication in English is more common. However, this comes at a higher cost, and health insurance is often necessary to cover expenses. Many private insurance providers offer plans that cover medical expenses in Georgia, including emergency evacuations and repatriations.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $5-$15 | $20-$50 | |\n| Specialist Consultation | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-$20 | $30-$70 | |\n| Eye Exam | $15-$30 | $40-$100 | |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $30-$50 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$100 | |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $50-$200 | |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$2,000 | |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,000-$3,000 | |\n| MRI Scan | $100-$300 | |\n| X-Ray | $20-$50 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, basic procedures |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-$300 | Specialist consultations, surgeries, evacuations |\n| International / Expat | $200-$500 | Global coverage, including US and EU, with emergency evacuations |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medication can be purchased at pharmacies with a doctor's prescription, with costs ranging from $5 to $20 for basic medications.\n- Over-the-counter medications are widely available, with prices similar to those in Western countries.\n- Pharmacies are common in urban areas, but less so in rural areas.\n- Some medications may be unavailable or difficult to find, especially in rural areas.\n- Prices for medications can vary significantly depending on the pharmacy and location.\n- It is recommended to bring any necessary prescription medications with you when traveling to Georgia.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the local emergency number, 112, which will connect you with ambulance services or other emergency responders. Ambulance services are generally available in urban areas, but may be less reliable in rural areas. For foreigners, it is recommended to seek medical care at private hospitals, which often have better equipment and more English-speaking staff. Some of the best hospitals for foreigners in Tbilisi include the Tbilisi Medical Center and the Georgian-American Medical Center, which offer modern facilities and international-standard care. It is also a good idea to have a plan in place for emergency evacuations, which can be expensive and may require specialized insurance coverage.",
