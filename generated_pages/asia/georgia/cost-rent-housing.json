Typical lease terms for apartment rentals are 6-12 months, with a deposit requirement of 1-2 months' rent. Tenant rights are protected by law, and renters can expect to have access to basic amenities such as electricity, water, and heating. Compared to its regional neighbors, Georgia's housing costs are relatively low, making it an attractive option for expats and tourists. However, prices can vary significantly depending on the location, with city center apartments tend to be more expensive than those in the suburbs or rural areas.\n\nThe housing market in Georgia is also influenced by the country's growing economy and tourism industry, with many new developments and renovations taking place in recent years. This has led to an increase in the availability of high-quality apartments and houses, particularly in the city center. However, the market can be competitive, and renters may need to act quickly to secure a desirable property. It's also worth noting that some landlords may require renters to pay utility bills separately, which can add to the overall cost of living.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $200-$400 | $100-$250 | (typical quality, 20-30 sqm) |\n| 1 Bedroom | $300-$500 | $150-$300 | (what to expect, 40-60 sqm) |\n| 2 Bedroom | $400-$700 | $250-$500 | (family size, 80-100 sqm) |\n| 3 Bedroom | $600-$1,000 | $400-$800 | (spacious, 120-150 sqm) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $1,500-$3,000 | (prime locations, such as Old Tbilisi) |\n| Suburbs | $800-$1,500 | (residential areas, such as Vake or Saburtalo) |\n| Rural | $200-$500 | (if applicable, such as in the countryside) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- Vake: a popular neighborhood for expats, with a range of apartments and houses available, and a typical rent range of $300-$600 USD per month.\n- Saburtalo: a bustling neighborhood with a mix of old and new buildings, and a typical rent range of $200-$400 USD per month.\n- Old Tbilisi: a historic neighborhood with a range of apartments and houses available, and a typical rent range of $400-$800 USD per month.\n- Mtatsminda: a upscale neighborhood with a range of apartments and houses available, and a typical rent range of $500-$1,000 USD per month.\n- Dighomi: a suburban neighborhood with a range of apartments and houses available, and a typical rent range of $150-$300 USD per month.\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Georgia [/SECTION]\n- Start your search early, as the rental market can be competitive, especially in the city center.\n- Be prepared to negotiate, as some landlords may be willing to lower the rent or offer additional amenities.\n- Be aware of scams, and always inspect the property before signing a lease.\n- Utilities such as electricity, water, and heating are usually not included in the rent, and renters will need to pay these separately.\n- Furnished apartments are less common in Georgia, so renters may need to provide their own furniture and appliances.\n- Consider working with a real estate agent, as they can help you find a suitable property and navigate the rental process.",
