[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Georgia is relatively affordable, with a wide range of options available in the capital city of Tbilisi and other major urban areas. Typical lease terms for apartment rentals are 6-12 months, with a deposit requirement of 1-2 months' rent. Tenant rights are protected by law, and renters can expect to have access to basic amenities such as electricity, water, and heating. Compared to its regional neighbors, Georgia's housing costs are relatively low, making it an attractive option for expats and tourists. However, prices can vary significantly depending on the location, with city center apartments tend to be more expensive than those in the suburbs or rural areas.

The housing market in Georgia is also influenced by the country's growing economy and tourism industry, with many new developments and renovations taking place in recent years. This has led to an increase in the availability of high-quality apartments and houses, particularly in the city center. However, the market can be competitive, and renters may need to act quickly to secure a desirable property. It's also worth noting that some landlords may require renters to pay utility bills separately, which can add to the overall cost of living.
