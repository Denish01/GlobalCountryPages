  "content": "The cost of utilities and internet in Georgia can vary depending on the location, usage, and provider, but on average, a monthly utility bill for an 85 sqm apartment can range from $150 to $250 USD.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Utilities (85 sqm apt): ($200 USD)\nInternet (60 Mbps): ($25 USD/month)\nMobile Data (10GB): ($10 USD/month)\nElectricity Cost: ($0.12 per kWh)\nCurrency: GEL\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nGeorgia's utility infrastructure is relatively well-developed, with a high percentage of the population having access to electricity, water, and gas. However, the cost of utilities can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher costs during the winter months due to increased demand for heating. The Georgian government has implemented measures to stabilize utility prices, but prices can still vary depending on the provider and location. The quality of utility services is generally good, with minimal disruptions to electricity and water supply.\n\nThe cost of utilities in Georgia is also affected by the country's reliance on imported energy sources, which can lead to price volatility. However, the government has been working to increase the use of renewable energy sources, such as hydroelectric power, to reduce the country's dependence on imported energy. This has helped to stabilize utility prices and reduce the impact of seasonal variations.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $30 | $50 | $70 | |\n| Water | $10 | $15 | $20 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $5 | $10 | $15 | (included in rent in some cases) |\n| **Total** | **$65** | **$105** | **$145** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $15-25 | 10-30 Mbps | Silknet, Magticom |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $30-50 | 60-100 Mbps | Silknet, Magticom |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $5-10 | 1-5 GB | Magticom, Geocell |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $10-20 | 5-10 GB | Magticom, Geocell |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $30-50 | varies | Silknet, Magticom |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (limited content) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Georgia, you will typically need to provide proof of residency and identification, and pay a deposit to the utility provider.\n- Prepaid electricity meters are available in some areas, which can help you track your energy usage and avoid unexpected bills.\n- The best internet providers in Georgia are Silknet and Magticom, which offer reliable and fast internet speeds.\n- To save on utility bills, consider using energy-efficient appliances and turning off lights and electronics when not in use.\n- You can also negotiate with your landlord or utility provider to get a better rate, especially if you are renting a long-term apartment.",
