The seasons significantly affect travel in Georgia, with the summer months being the busiest and most crowded, while the winter months are quieter but may have limited access to certain areas due to snow and ice.\n\nThe spring season, which lasts from March to May, is a great time to visit Georgia, with mild temperatures and fewer tourists. The autumn season, which runs from September to November, is also a popular time to visit, with comfortable temperatures and a vibrant **harvest festival** scene.
