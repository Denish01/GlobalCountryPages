[SECTION] How Georgia Is Divided [/SECTION]
Georgia is divided into 9 regions, 1 autonomous republic, and 2 autonomous cities. The 9 regions are: Guria, Imereti, Kakheti, Kvemo Kartli, Mtskheta-Mtianeti, Racha-Lechkhumi and Kvemo Svaneti, Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti, Samtskhe-Javakheti, and Shida Kartli. The autonomous republic is Adjara, and the 2 autonomous cities are Tbilisi and Kutaisi. This administrative structure allows for a balance of power between the central government and the regional authorities.

The regional divisions are based on a combination of historical, cultural, and geographical factors. Each region has its own unique character and identity, shaped by its history, traditions, and natural environment. The autonomous republic of Adjara, for example, has a distinct cultural and linguistic identity, with a strong emphasis on Islamic traditions. The regions of Georgia are also home to a diverse range of ethnic and linguistic groups, adding to the country's rich cultural tapestry.
