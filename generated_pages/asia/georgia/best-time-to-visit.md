[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Georgia's climate varies from **temperate** to **alpine**, with different regions experiencing distinct seasonal patterns. The country can be divided into two main climate zones: the low-lying areas, which have a **humid subtropical** climate, and the mountainous regions, which have a **continental** climate with cold winters and mild summers. The dry season typically runs from May to October, while the wet season occurs from November to April. The seasons significantly affect travel in Georgia, with the summer months being the busiest and most crowded, while the winter months are quieter but may have limited access to certain areas due to snow and ice.

The spring season, which lasts from March to May, is a great time to visit Georgia, with mild temperatures and fewer tourists. The autumn season, which runs from September to November, is also a popular time to visit, with comfortable temperatures and a vibrant **harvest festival** scene. The summer months, although crowded, offer a range of outdoor activities, including **hiking**, **swimming**, and **cycling**. In contrast, the winter months are ideal for **skiing** and **snowboarding**, with several world-class resorts in the **Caucasus Mountains**.

Georgia's diverse climate and geography make it a year-round destination, with each season offering unique experiences and activities. However, the country's infrastructure and tourist facilities are not always equipped to handle the demands of peak season, which can result in higher prices and crowds. Therefore, it is essential to plan carefully and research the best times to visit specific regions and attractions.
