There are several regional dialects of Georgian, including the Kartlian, Kakhetian, and Imeretian dialects, which are spoken in different parts of the country. In addition to Georgian, many Georgians also speak **Russian**, which was widely taught in schools during the Soviet era, as well as **English**, which is becoming increasingly popular, particularly among younger people. There are also several minority languages spoken in Georgia, including **Azerbaijani** and **Armenian**, which are spoken by the country's Azerbaijani and Armenian populations. While English is not widely spoken in Georgia, it is becoming more common, particularly in tourist areas and among younger people.\n\nThe use of English in Georgia is not as widespread as in some other European countries, but it is still possible to get by with English, particularly in larger cities like Tbilisi. Many signs and menus are translated into English, and many younger people speak some English. However, it is still a good idea to learn some basic **Georgian phrases**, which will be greatly appreciated by the locals. In addition to Georgian and Russian, there are also several other languages spoken in Georgia, including **Turkish** and **German**, which are spoken by smaller communities of people.\n\nGeorgia's linguistic diversity is also reflected in its language family, which is known as **Kartvelian**. This language family is unique to the region and includes several languages, including Georgian, Svan, and Mingrelian. The Georgian language is also written in its own unique script, which is known as the **Georgian alphabet**. This alphabet is one of the oldest in the world and is still used today to write the Georgian language.\n\n[SECTION] Essential Phrases [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| English | Local Language | Pronunciation | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hello | გამარჯობა (gamarjoba) | gah-mar-joh-bah | formal |\n| Hello (informal) | გამარჯო (gamarijo) | gah-mar-yoh | informal |\n| Thank you | მადლობა (madloba) | mahd-loh-bah |  |\n| Please | თქვან (tkvan) | too-kvahn |  |\n| Yes / No | დიახ / არა (diakh / ara) | dee-akh / ah-rah |  |\n| Excuse me | მე ბეზღური (me bezghuri) | meh behz-goo-ree |  |\n| How much? | რამდენი ღირს (ramdeni ghirs) | rahm-deh-nee geers |  |\n| Where is...? | სად არის...
