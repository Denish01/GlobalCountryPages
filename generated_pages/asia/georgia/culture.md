# Georgia Culture - Food, Traditions & Etiquette

[SECTION] Cultural Identity [/SECTION]
Georgia's culture is a unique blend of European and Asian influences, shaped by its strategic location at the crossroads of the two continents. The country has a rich history, with evidence of human habitation dating back to the Paleolithic era. The Georgian people have a strong sense of national identity, with a distinct language, **Kartvelian**, which is unlike any other language in the world. The country's ethnic makeup is predominantly Georgian, with smaller minority groups including Azerbaijanis, Armenians, and Russians. The Georgian Orthodox Church plays a significant role in the country's cultural and spiritual life, with approximately 83% of the population identifying as Orthodox Christian.

The cultural landscape of Georgia has been influenced by various empires and civilizations throughout history, including the ancient Greeks, Romans, and Persians. The country's unique cultural heritage is reflected in its architecture, art, and literature, which often blend traditional and modern elements. The Georgian people are known for their hospitality and welcoming nature, with a strong emphasis on family and social bonds. The concept of **"guest culture"** is deeply ingrained in Georgian society, where visitors are treated with great respect and generosity.

Georgia's cultural identity is also closely tied to its stunning natural beauty, with the Caucasus Mountains providing a dramatic backdrop to the country's rolling hills, forests, and coastal regions. The country's diverse climate and geography have given rise to a wide range of flora and fauna, with many species found nowhere else in the world. The Georgian people have a deep appreciation for their natural environment, with a growing emphasis on sustainable tourism and environmental conservation.
