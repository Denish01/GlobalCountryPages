[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in Georgia is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of good quality, with well-trained medical professionals and modern equipment, particularly in the capital city of Tbilisi. However, there can be significant disparities in the quality of care between urban and rural areas, with rural areas often having more limited access to specialized services and modern facilities. The private healthcare sector is also well-developed, with many private hospitals and clinics offering high-quality services, often with English-speaking staff and modern equipment.

The quality of care in Georgia is generally considered to be good, with many medical professionals having received training in Europe or the United States. However, there can be challenges in terms of access to care, particularly for those living in rural areas or with limited financial resources. The government has implemented a number of initiatives aimed at improving access to healthcare, including a universal health insurance program that covers all citizens.

Despite these efforts, there are still significant challenges facing the healthcare system in Georgia, including a shortage of medical professionals in certain specialties and a lack of modern equipment and facilities in some areas. Additionally, the healthcare system can be bureaucratic and slow, with long waiting times for appointments and procedures.
