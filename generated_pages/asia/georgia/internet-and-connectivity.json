  "content": "In Georgia, you can expect a relatively well-developed internet infrastructure with decent speeds and widespread coverage, making it easy to stay connected during your travels. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nAverage Internet Speed: 20 Mbps download\nMobile Network Coverage: Good\nMain Carriers: MagtiCom, Geocell, Beeline\nSIM Card Cost: 10 USD for tourist SIM\nWiFi Availability: Widespread\n5G Available: Limited\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]\nThe internet quality in Georgia is generally good, with an average download speed of 20 Mbps, which is sufficient for browsing, streaming, and social media. However, there is a noticeable urban-rural divide in terms of internet speeds and reliability. In major cities like Tbilisi, Batumi, and Kutaisi, you can expect faster speeds and more reliable connections, while rural areas may experience slower speeds and more frequent outages. Despite this, the overall internet infrastructure in Georgia has improved significantly in recent years, making it easier for tourists and remote workers to stay connected.\n\nThe reliability of the internet in Georgia is also relatively good, with most providers offering stable connections and minimal downtime. However, it's not uncommon to experience occasional outages or slow speeds, especially during peak hours or in areas with high demand. To mitigate this, many cafes, restaurants, and hotels offer **WiFi** as a backup option, which can be a lifesaver in case of an emergency. Additionally, many internet service providers offer **mobile hotspots** and **backup internet plans** to ensure uninterrupted connectivity.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nTo get a SIM card in Georgia, you can visit one of the many mobile operator stores, such as MagtiCom, Geocell, or Beeline, which can be found in major cities and towns. You will need to provide a valid passport and register your SIM card, which usually takes a few minutes. The cost of a tourist SIM card is around 10 USD, which typically includes a certain amount of data, minutes, and texts. We recommend purchasing a SIM card from one of the top carriers, as they offer the best coverage and data plans.\n\nSome popular data plans for tourists include the MagtiCom Tourist Plan, which offers 1 GB of data, 100 minutes, and 100 texts for 10 USD, and the Geocell Tourist Plan, which offers 2 GB of data, 200 minutes, and 200 texts for 15 USD. It's worth noting that these plans can be purchased at the airport or at mobile operator stores, and can be easily topped up online or at a physical store.\n\n[TABLE]\n| Carrier | Tourist Plan | Data | Price (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| MagtiCom | Tourist Plan | 1 GB | 10 | Includes 100 minutes and 100 texts |\n| Geocell | Tourist Plan | 2 GB | 15 | Includes 200 minutes and 200 texts |\n| Beeline | Tourist Plan | 3 GB | 20 | Includes 300 minutes and 300 texts |\n| Silknet | Tourist Plan | 5 GB | 25 | Includes 500 minutes and 500 texts |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] WiFi Availability [/SECTION]\n- Hotel WiFi quality is generally good, with most hotels offering free and fast WiFi to their guests\n- Cafe WiFi culture is prevalent in Georgia, with many cafes and restaurants offering free WiFi to customers\n- Coworking spaces are becoming increasingly popular in major cities, offering fast and reliable WiFi to remote workers and entrepreneurs\n- Public WiFi is available in many parks and public areas, although the speed and reliability can be variable\n- Many shopping malls and restaurants also offer free WiFi to customers, making it easy to stay connected on the go\n\n[SECTION] For Remote Workers [/SECTION]\n- Coworking spaces like Impact Hub Tbilisi and Garage Tbilisi offer fast and reliable WiFi, as well as a community of like-minded entrepreneurs and remote workers\n- Reliable cafe chains like Coffee Bean and Costa Coffee offer good WiFi and a comfortable working environment\n- Backup internet options like mobile hotspots and portable WiFi routers can be purchased or rented for emergencies\n- VPNs are recommended for secure and private browsing, especially when using public WiFi networks\n- Many libraries and universities also offer free WiFi and a quiet working environment, making them a great option for remote workers\n\n[SECTION] Tips & Warnings [/SECTION]\n- Internet censorship is not a major issue in Georgia, although some websites may be blocked due to copyright or security reasons\n- Blocked sites can usually be accessed using a VPN or proxy server\n- VPNs are recommended for secure and private browsing, especially when using public WiFi networks\n- Roaming alternatives like portable WiFi routers and mobile hotspots can be more cost-effective than roaming with your home carrier\n- eSIM options are becoming increasingly popular, offering a convenient and affordable way to stay connected while traveling\n- It's always a good idea to purchase a local SIM card or portable WiFi router, as they often offer better coverage and data plans than roaming with your home carrier",
