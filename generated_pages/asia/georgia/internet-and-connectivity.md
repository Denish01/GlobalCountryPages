[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet quality in Georgia is generally good, with an average download speed of 20 Mbps, which is sufficient for browsing, streaming, and social media. However, there is a noticeable urban-rural divide in terms of internet speeds and reliability. In major cities like Tbilisi, Batumi, and Kutaisi, you can expect faster speeds and more reliable connections, while rural areas may experience slower speeds and more frequent outages. Despite this, the overall internet infrastructure in Georgia has improved significantly in recent years, making it easier for tourists and remote workers to stay connected.

The reliability of the internet in Georgia is also relatively good, with most providers offering stable connections and minimal downtime. However, it's not uncommon to experience occasional outages or slow speeds, especially during peak hours or in areas with high demand. To mitigate this, many cafes, restaurants, and hotels offer **WiFi** as a backup option, which can be a lifesaver in case of an emergency. Additionally, many internet service providers offer **mobile hotspots** and **backup internet plans** to ensure uninterrupted connectivity.

[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]
To get a SIM card in Georgia, you can visit one of the many mobile operator stores, such as MagtiCom, Geocell, or Beeline, which can be found in major cities and towns. You will need to provide a valid passport and register your SIM card, which usually takes a few minutes. The cost of a tourist SIM card is around 10 USD, which typically includes a certain amount of data, minutes, and texts. We recommend purchasing a SIM card from one of the top carriers, as they offer the best coverage and data plans.

Some popular data plans for tourists include the MagtiCom Tourist Plan, which offers 1 GB of data, 100 minutes, and 100 texts for 10 USD, and the Geocell Tourist Plan, which offers 2 GB of data, 200 minutes, and 200 texts for 15 USD. It's worth noting that these plans can be purchased at the airport or at mobile operator stores, and can be easily topped up online or at a physical store.
