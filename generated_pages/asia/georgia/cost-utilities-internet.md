[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Georgia's utility infrastructure is relatively well-developed, with a high percentage of the population having access to electricity, water, and gas. However, the cost of utilities can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher costs during the winter months due to increased demand for heating. The Georgian government has implemented measures to stabilize utility prices, but prices can still vary depending on the provider and location. The quality of utility services is generally good, with minimal disruptions to electricity and water supply.

The cost of utilities in Georgia is also affected by the country's reliance on imported energy sources, which can lead to price volatility. However, the government has been working to increase the use of renewable energy sources, such as hydroelectric power, to reduce the country's dependence on imported energy. This has helped to stabilize utility prices and reduce the impact of seasonal variations.
