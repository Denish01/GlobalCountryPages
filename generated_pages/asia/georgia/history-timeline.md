# Georgia History — Key Events & Timeline

The history of Georgia is a complex and fascinating narrative that spans thousands of years, from ancient civilizations to modern-day independence. 

[SECTION] Historical Overview [/SECTION]
The territory of modern-day Georgia has been inhabited since the Paleolithic era, with archaeological evidence showing human presence dating back to the Stone Age. The ancient Georgians developed a unique culture, with the **Colchic** and **Iberian** kingdoms emerging in the region around 1000 BC. These kingdoms played an important role in the ancient world, with trade and cultural exchanges with neighboring civilizations, including the ancient Greeks and Romans. In the 4th century AD, Georgia adopted **Christianity** as its official religion, which had a profound impact on the country's development and identity. The medieval period saw the rise of the **Bagrationi** dynasty, which unified various Georgian kingdoms and principalities, laying the foundation for the modern Georgian state.

The Middle Ages were marked by constant struggles against neighboring empires, including the **Mongols**, **Turks**, and **Persians**. Despite these challenges, Georgia maintained its independence and developed a rich cultural heritage, with notable figures such as **Shota Rustaveli**, a renowned poet and writer. The 19th century saw Georgia come under **Russian** rule, which had a significant impact on the country's language, culture, and politics. The Russian Empire's expansion into the region led to the abolition of the Georgian monarchy and the imposition of Russian language and culture. However, the Georgian people maintained their national identity and continued to strive for independence.

The 20th century was marked by significant events, including the country's brief independence after the Russian Revolution, followed by the establishment of the **Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic**. During World War II, Georgia played an important role in the Soviet war effort, with many Georgians fighting on the front lines. The post-war period saw a rise in nationalist sentiment, with many Georgians seeking greater autonomy or independence from the Soviet Union. The late 1980s and early 1990s saw a surge in nationalist movements, culminating in Georgia's declaration of independence in 1991.

In the modern era, Georgia has continued to develop its economy, politics, and culture, with a focus on **European integration** and **democratization**. The country has faced significant challenges, including conflicts with neighboring countries and internal political instability. However, Georgia has made significant progress in recent years, with a growing economy and a strengthening democracy.
