[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Georgia is a sovereign country located in the Caucasus region of Asia, situated at the crossroads of Eastern Europe and Western Asia. It is bordered by Russia to the north, Azerbaijan to the east, Armenia to the south, and Turkey to the southwest. The country has a short coastline along the Black Sea to the west, which provides a significant outlet to the Mediterranean Sea and international trade routes. The strategic location of Georgia has made it an important hub for trade and cultural exchange between Europe and Asia for centuries.

The country's borders are defined by a combination of natural and artificial boundaries. The Greater Caucasus Mountain Range forms the northern border with Russia, while the Lesser Caucasus Mountains mark the border with Turkey to the southwest. The southern border with Armenia and Azerbaijan is largely defined by rivers and valleys. The Black Sea coastline to the west provides a natural boundary, and the country's ports and coastal cities have played a significant role in its economic and cultural development.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Georgia's terrain is characterized by a diverse range of landscapes, including snow-capped mountains, fertile valleys, and a scenic coastline along the Black Sea. The Greater Caucasus Mountain Range, which stretches across the northern part of the country, is home to some of the highest peaks in Europe, including Mount Shkhara, the country's highest point. The mountains are covered with dense forests, alpine meadows, and glaciers, making them a popular destination for hiking, skiing, and other outdoor activities.

The central part of the country is dominated by the Kura River valley, which provides fertile soil and a mild climate, making it suitable for agriculture and human settlement. The valley is surrounded by hills and mountains, including the Lesser Caucasus Range to the south and the Surami Range to the west. The coastal region along the Black Sea is characterized by a narrow strip of low-lying land, with beaches, ports, and coastal cities such as Batumi and Poti.

The country's diverse landscape has created a range of ecosystems, including temperate rainforests, deciduous forests, and alpine meadows. The forests of Georgia are home to a wide range of flora and fauna, including bears, wolves, and eagles. The country's natural beauty and biodiversity have made it a popular destination for ecotourism and outdoor activities.
