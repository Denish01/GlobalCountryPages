Non-residents are taxed only on their Georgian-sourced income, while residents are taxed on their worldwide income, but with the possibility of claiming foreign tax credits.

The country's tax authority, the Revenue Service, is responsible for administering taxes and providing guidance to taxpayers. Georgia has a relatively simple tax system, with a focus on encouraging foreign investment and economic growth. The country has a network of double taxation treaties with 54 countries, which helps to reduce the tax burden on individuals and companies with international income. Overall, Georgia's tax system is designed to be business-friendly and attractive to foreign investors.
