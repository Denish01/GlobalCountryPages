[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Georgia's infrastructure has undergone significant development in recent years, with a focus on improving the country's transportation network, energy sector, and telecommunications systems. The government has invested heavily in upgrading the country's roads, railways, and airports, with a view to increasing trade and tourism. However, there is still a significant gap between urban and rural areas, with many rural communities lacking access to basic services such as reliable electricity, clean water, and sanitation. The country's infrastructure development is also hindered by its mountainous terrain, which makes it difficult and expensive to build and maintain roads, bridges, and other infrastructure.

Despite these challenges, Georgia has made significant progress in recent years, with the country's infrastructure ranking improving significantly in various global indices. The government has also launched several initiatives aimed at promoting private sector investment in infrastructure, including the creation of a dedicated infrastructure investment fund. These efforts are expected to continue in the coming years, with a focus on improving the country's competitiveness and attractiveness to foreign investors.

The country's infrastructure development is also closely tied to its regional integration efforts, with Georgia seeking to strengthen its economic ties with neighboring countries and improve its connectivity to European and Asian markets. The country's strategic location at the crossroads of Europe and Asia makes it an important transit country for trade and energy, and its infrastructure development is critical to realizing its full potential as a regional hub.
