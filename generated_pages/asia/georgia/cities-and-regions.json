The 9 regions are: Guria, Imereti, Kakheti, Kvemo Kartli, Mtskheta-Mtianeti, Racha-Lechkhumi and Kvemo Svaneti, Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti, Samtskhe-Javakheti, and Shida Kartli. The autonomous republic is Adjara, and the 2 autonomous cities are Tbilisi and Kutaisi. This administrative structure allows for a balance of power between the central government and the regional authorities.\n\nThe regional divisions are based on a combination of historical, cultural, and geographical factors. Each region has its own unique character and identity, shaped by its history, traditions, and natural environment. The autonomous republic of Adjara, for example, has a distinct cultural and linguistic identity, with a strong emphasis on Islamic traditions. The regions of Georgia are also home to a diverse range of ethnic and linguistic groups, adding to the country's rich cultural tapestry.\n\n[SECTION] Major Cities [/SECTION]\n**Tbilisi** (1.1 million)\nRole: capital, cultural center, economic hub\nKnown For: its historic old town, thermal springs, and vibrant cultural scene\nBest For: visitors interested in history, culture, and entertainment\n**Kutaisi** (147,000)\nRole: economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: its ancient history, medieval architecture, and vibrant market\nBest For: visitors interested in history, culture, and shopping\n**Batumi** (152,000)\nRole: port city, tourist center\nKnown For: its stunning coastline, modern architecture, and lively nightlife\nBest For: visitors interested in beach activities, nightlife, and relaxation\n**Rustavi** (125,000)\nRole: industrial center, economic hub\nKnown For: its steel production, automotive industry, and historic castle\nBest For: visitors interested in industry, history, and culture\n**Gori** (48,000)\nRole: cultural center, historic town\nKnown For: its medieval architecture, historic castle, and connection to Joseph Stalin\nBest For: visitors interested in history, culture, and Soviet-era heritage\n**Zugdidi** (42,000)\nRole: regional center, cultural hub\nKnown For: its historic architecture, vibrant market, and stunning natural surroundings\nBest For: visitors interested in culture, history, and outdoor activities\n**Poti** (41,000)\nRole: port city, industrial center\nKnown For: its stunning coastline, historic architecture, and vibrant cultural scene\nBest For: visitors interested in beach activities, culture, and industry\n\n[SECTION] Key Regions [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Region | Character | Known For | Major City |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Adjara | autonomous republic, multicultural | beaches, mountains, Islamic traditions | Batumi |\n| Guria | coastal region, rural | beaches, agriculture, folk music | Ozurgeti |\n| Imereti | historic region, cultural | ancient ruins, medieval architecture, wine production | Kutaisi |\n| Kakheti | wine region, rural | vineyards, wine production, historic architecture | Telavi |\n| Kvemo Kartli | agricultural region, rural | agriculture, historic architecture, multicultural | Rustavi |\n| Mtskheta-Mtianeti | historic region, cultural | ancient ruins, medieval architecture, Orthodox traditions | Mtskheta |\n| Racha-Lechkhumi and Kvemo Svaneti | mountainous region, rural | stunning natural beauty, outdoor activities, traditional villages | Ambrolauri |\n| Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti | mountainous region, rural | stunning natural beauty, outdoor activities, traditional villages | Zugdidi |\n| Samtskhe-Javakheti | mountainous region, rural | stunning natural beauty, outdoor activities, historic architecture | Akhaltsikhe |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Differences [/SECTION]\n- The regions of Georgia differ significantly in terms of culture, with some regions having a strong emphasis on Islamic traditions, while others are predominantly Orthodox Christian.\n- The economy also varies by region, with some regions relying heavily on agriculture, while others are driven by industry or tourism.\n- The climate and geography of Georgia's regions are also diverse, ranging from the subtropical coastline of Adjara to the snow-capped mountains of Svaneti.\n- Language is another factor that differentiates the regions, with some regions having a higher percentage of Russian or Azerbaijani speakers, while others are predominantly Georgian-speaking.\n\n[SECTION] Getting Around [/SECTION]\nGeorgia has a well-developed transportation network, with domestic flights, trains, buses, and taxis available.
