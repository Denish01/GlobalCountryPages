The education system in Georgia is divided into three main stages: primary, secondary, and tertiary education. Primary education is compulsory for all children and lasts for six years, starting from the age of six.

Tertiary education, also known as higher education, is provided by universities and colleges, and typically lasts for four years for a bachelor's degree. The quality of education in Georgia has improved significantly in recent years, with a strong focus on increasing access to education, particularly in rural areas. Both public and private schools are available, with public schools being free and private schools charging tuition fees.

The Georgian education system has undergone significant reforms in recent years, with a focus on improving the quality of teaching and learning, as well as increasing access to education. The government has introduced a number of initiatives, including the introduction of a new curriculum, the development of teacher training programs, and the establishment of a national assessment and evaluation system. Despite these efforts, the education system in Georgia still faces a number of challenges, including a shortage of qualified teachers, inadequate infrastructure, and limited resources.
