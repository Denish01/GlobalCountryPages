[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Israel has several international airports, with Ben Gurion Airport (TLV) being the main entry point for most travelers. Located about 15 kilometers southeast of Tel Aviv, Ben Gurion Airport offers direct flights to many destinations around the world, including major hubs in Europe, North America, and Asia. You can also enter Israel overland from neighboring countries, including Jordan, Egypt, and Palestine, although this may require more planning and documentation. The main overland entry points are the Allenby Bridge from Jordan, the Taba Border Crossing from Egypt, and the Erez Crossing from Gaza.

In addition to Ben Gurion Airport, Israel has several smaller international airports, including Ovda Airport (VDA) near Eilat and Haifa Airport (HFA), which offer flights to select destinations in Europe and the Middle East. If you're planning to visit Israel from a country without direct flights, you may need to transit through a major hub, such as Amsterdam, Paris, or Istanbul. It's a good idea to research your flight options and book in advance to get the best prices and schedules.

Israel has a moderate domestic air network, with several airlines offering flights between major cities, including Tel Aviv, Haifa, Eilat, and Beersheba. The main domestic airlines are El Al, Arkia, and Israir, which operate flights from Ben Gurion Airport and other smaller airports. Domestic flights can be a convenient option for traveling long distances, especially if you're short on time. You can book domestic flights online through the airlines' websites or through a travel agency. Approximate costs for domestic flights range from $50 to $200, depending on the route and time of booking.
