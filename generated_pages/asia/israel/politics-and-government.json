  "content": "Israel is a **parliamentary democracy** with a unique system of government that combines elements of both **unitary** and **federal** systems.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nGovernment Type: Parliamentary Democracy\nHead of State: President (Isaac Herzog)\nHead of Government: Prime Minister (Benjamin Netanyahu)\nLegislature: Knesset, Unicameral, 120 seats\nLegal System: Mixed (Civil Law, Common Law, and Jewish Law)\nPolitical Stability Index: Ranked 53rd out of 178 countries in the 2022 Global Peace Index\nCorruption Index: Ranked 31st out of 180 countries in the 2022 Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]\nThe Israeli government is based on a system of **separation of powers**, where the **executive**, **legislative**, and **judicial** branches are separate and independent. The **Knesset**, Israel's unicameral legislature, is composed of 120 members who are elected by **proportional representation** for a term of four years. The **Prime Minister** is the head of government and is responsible for appointing ministers and overseeing the implementation of policies. The **President** serves as the head of state and has ceremonial and symbolic duties.\n\nThe Israeli political system is characterized by a **multiparty system**, where several parties compete for seats in the Knesset. This system often leads to **coalition governments**, where multiple parties form alliances to achieve a majority. The government is responsible for making and implementing policies, while the Knesset provides **oversight** and **accountability**. The **judicial branch** is independent and plays a crucial role in interpreting the law and ensuring that the government acts within its constitutional powers.\n\nThe Israeli system of government is also influenced by the country's **Basic Laws**, which serve as a **de facto** constitution. These laws provide a framework for the government and the protection of individual rights. However, the lack of a formal constitution has led to ongoing debates about the role of the **Supreme Court** and the balance of power between the different branches of government.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | Government | Prime Minister | Head of Government, appoints ministers |\n| Legislative | Knesset | Speaker of the Knesset | Unicameral legislature, makes laws |\n| Judicial | Supreme Court | President of the Supreme Court | Highest court, interprets laws and ensures constitutional compliance |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Major Political Parties [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Party | Position | Leader | Seats | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Likud | Right-wing | Benjamin Netanyahu | 30 | Nationalist, free-market oriented |\n| Yesh Atid | Centrist | Yair Lapid | 24 | Liberal, secular, and pro-peace |\n| Blue and White | Centrist | Benny Gantz | 15 | Nationalist, pro-peace, and liberal |\n| Labor Party | Left-wing | Merav Michaeli | 7 | Social democratic, pro-peace, and pro-labor |\n| United Torah Judaism | Right-wing | Yaakov Litzman | 7 | Ultra-orthodox, conservative, and pro-religious |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Elections [/SECTION]\n- The electoral system in Israel is based on **proportional representation**, where voters cast ballots for parties rather than individual candidates.\n- Elections are held every four years, unless the government loses a vote of confidence or a coalition collapses.\n- The last election was held in 2022, and the next election is scheduled for 2026.\n- Voter participation is generally high, with around 70% of eligible voters casting ballots in recent elections.\n\n[SECTION] Political Stability & Challenges [/SECTION]\n- The current political climate in Israel is characterized by **polarization** and **instability**, with ongoing debates about the role of the **Supreme Court** and the balance of power between the different branches of government.\n- Key issues include the **Israeli-Palestinian conflict**, **economic inequality**, and **corruption**.\n- Regional dynamics, including the **Iranian nuclear program** and the **Syrian civil war**, also pose significant challenges to Israel's security and stability.\n- Freedom indices, such as the **Freedom House** rating, have raised concerns about the erosion of **democratic norms** and the **rule of law** in Israel.\n- The **Corruption Perceptions Index** has also highlighted the need for greater transparency and accountability in government.\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Relations [/SECTION]\n- Israel is a member of several international organizations, including the **United Nations**, the **International Monetary Fund**, and the **World Trade Organization**.\n- The country has a **special relationship** with the **United States**, which provides significant military and economic aid.\n- Israel is also a member of the **European Union's** **Association Agreement**, which provides preferential trade terms and cooperation on issues such as research and development.\n- The country has a **complex** and often **tense** relationship with its **Arab neighbors**, including **Palestine**, **Lebanon**, and **Syria**.\n- Israel has also developed **diplomatic relations** with several countries in **Africa** and **Asia**, and has sought to expand its **economic ties** with countries such as **China** and **India**.",
