[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Israel is located in the Middle East, on the southeastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea. It shares borders with several countries, including Lebanon to the north, Syria to the northeast, Jordan to the east, Egypt to the southwest, and Palestine to the east and west. The country is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the west, the Red Sea to the south, and the Jordan River to the east. This strategic location has made Israel an important crossroads between Europe, Asia, and Africa.

Israel's borders have been a subject of controversy and conflict over the years, particularly with its neighbors Palestine and Syria. The country's geography has also played a significant role in its history, with the Jordan River and the Dead Sea forming natural borders to the east. The Mediterranean coastline has also been an important factor in Israel's economy, with several major ports and cities located along the coast. The country's location at the intersection of several major trade routes has made it an important hub for international trade and commerce.
