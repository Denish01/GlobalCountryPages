The average internet speed in Israel is around 20 Mbps, which is relatively high compared to other countries in the region. Urban areas such as Tel Aviv and Jerusalem tend to have the fastest internet speeds, while rural areas may experience slightly slower connections. However, even in rural areas, the internet is generally reliable and widely available. Israel's internet quality is also supported by a strong focus on technology and innovation, with many startups and tech companies based in the country.\n\nThe urban-rural divide in internet quality is not as pronounced in Israel as it is in some other countries, thanks to significant investments in rural broadband infrastructure. As a result, visitors can expect to have access to fast and reliable internet connections throughout their stay, whether they are in a major city or a smaller town. Additionally, Israel's mobile network coverage is excellent, with all major carriers offering 4G and 5G services across the country. This means that visitors can stay connected on the go, whether they are using a SIM card or relying on WiFi.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nGetting a SIM card in Israel is a relatively straightforward process, with several options available for tourists. The main carriers in Israel are Cellcom, Partner, and Pelephone, all of which offer a range of prepaid and postpaid plans. Tourists can purchase a SIM card at the airport, or at one of the many carrier stores or kiosks located throughout the country. To purchase a SIM card, visitors will typically need to provide their passport and a valid form of identification. Recommended carriers for tourists include Cellcom and Partner, both of which offer a range of affordable plans with generous data allowances.\n\nData plans in Israel are generally affordable, with prices starting from around 10 USD per month for a basic plan with 1-2 GB of data. More comprehensive plans with larger data allowances are also available, with prices ranging from 20-50 USD per month.
