The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of high quality, with well-equipped hospitals and experienced medical professionals. However, the system can be bureaucratic and waiting times for non-emergency procedures can be long. Private healthcare providers, on the other hand, offer a more personalized and efficient service, but at a higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is generally the preferred option, while foreigners may opt for private healthcare due to the language barrier and faster service.\n\nThe Israeli healthcare system is based on a national health insurance law, which requires all citizens to have health insurance. There are four main health insurance providers in Israel, which offer a range of coverage options. For foreigners, it is recommended to have private health insurance, as the public healthcare system may not always be accessible. Additionally, some medical procedures and treatments may not be covered by the public healthcare system, making private health insurance a necessary option for those who can afford it.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Prices vary by city and doctor |\n| Specialist Consultation | $50-$100 | $100-$200 | Prices vary by specialty and location |\n| Dental Checkup | $30-$70 | $70-$150 | Prices vary by dentist and location |\n| Eye Exam | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Prices vary by optometrist and location |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Prices vary by lab and location |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $100-$300 | Prices vary by hospital and severity of condition |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $500-$1,500 | Prices vary by hospital and type of room |\n| Basic Surgery | $1,000-$5,000 | Prices vary by type of surgery and hospital |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,500-$3,000 | Prices vary by hospital and type of delivery |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | Prices vary by hospital and type of scan |\n| X-Ray | $50-$200 | Prices vary by hospital and type of X-ray |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $100-$200 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, basic procedures |\n| Comprehensive Private | $200-$500 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, advanced procedures, dental and vision care |\n| International / Expat | $300-$1,000 | Global coverage, emergency evacuations, advanced procedures |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medication prices vary by pharmacy and location, but are generally lower than in the US\n- Over-the-counter medication is widely available and relatively affordable\n- Prescription rules are strict, and medication can only be prescribed by a licensed doctor\n- Pharmacies are widely available, especially in urban areas\n- Common medications such as pain relievers and antibiotics can cost between $5-$20\n- Specialized medications such as insulin and asthma inhalers can cost between $20-$100 per month\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the emergency number 101, which will connect you to a paramedic or emergency services operator.
