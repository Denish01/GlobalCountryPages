[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The Israeli government is based on a system of **separation of powers**, where the **executive**, **legislative**, and **judicial** branches are separate and independent. The **Knesset**, Israel's unicameral legislature, is composed of 120 members who are elected by **proportional representation** for a term of four years. The **Prime Minister** is the head of government and is responsible for appointing ministers and overseeing the implementation of policies. The **President** serves as the head of state and has ceremonial and symbolic duties.

The Israeli political system is characterized by a **multiparty system**, where several parties compete for seats in the Knesset. This system often leads to **coalition governments**, where multiple parties form alliances to achieve a majority. The government is responsible for making and implementing policies, while the Knesset provides **oversight** and **accountability**. The **judicial branch** is independent and plays a crucial role in interpreting the law and ensuring that the government acts within its constitutional powers.

The Israeli system of government is also influenced by the country's **Basic Laws**, which serve as a **de facto** constitution. These laws provide a framework for the government and the protection of individual rights. However, the lack of a formal constitution has led to ongoing debates about the role of the **Supreme Court** and the balance of power between the different branches of government.
