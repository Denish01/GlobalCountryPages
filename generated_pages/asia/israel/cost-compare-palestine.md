[SECTION] Overview: Israel vs Palestine [/SECTION]
The cost of living in Israel and Palestine varies significantly, with Israel being one of the most expensive countries in the Middle East. The main reason for this difference is the strong economy and high standard of living in Israel, which drives up prices for housing, food, and transportation. In contrast, Palestine has a smaller economy and a lower standard of living, resulting in lower prices for most goods and services. On average, Palestine is around 20-30% cheaper than Israel, making it a more affordable option for expats, students, and retirees.

The economic context of both countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Israel has a highly developed economy with a strong tech industry, which contributes to its high cost of living. Palestine, on the other hand, has a smaller economy that is heavily reliant on international aid and trade with neighboring countries. This difference in economic development is reflected in the prices of goods and services, with Israel generally being more expensive than Palestine. However, it's worth noting that prices can vary significantly depending on the location, with cities like Tel Aviv and Jerusalem being more expensive than smaller towns and rural areas.
