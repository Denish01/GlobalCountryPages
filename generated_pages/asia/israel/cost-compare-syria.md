[SECTION] Overview: Israel vs Syria [/SECTION]
Israel and Syria are two neighboring countries with distinct economic profiles. Israel has a high-income economy with a strong tech industry, while Syria has been facing significant economic challenges due to ongoing conflict and sanctions. As a result, the cost of living in Israel is significantly higher than in Syria. Rent, food, and transportation costs in Israel are substantially higher, making it a more expensive destination for expats, tourists, and locals alike. In contrast, Syria offers a much lower cost of living, although the country's economic instability and limited access to basic services can make it a challenging place to live.

The economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Israel has a highly developed economy with a strong service sector, while Syria's economy has been severely impacted by the ongoing conflict. As a result, Israel has a higher GDP per capita and a lower inflation rate, making it a more stable and predictable economy. However, this stability comes at a cost, with prices for goods and services in Israel being significantly higher than in Syria. In contrast, Syria's economy is more volatile, with a high inflation rate and limited access to basic services, making it a more challenging place to live.
