Israel has a high-income economy with a strong technology sector, while Jordan has a developing economy with a significant service sector. The cost of living in Israel is generally higher than in Jordan, mainly due to Israel's higher GDP per capita and stronger economy.

This makes Jordan an attractive destination for expats, students, and retirees looking for a lower cost of living.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Israel has a highly developed infrastructure, a strong education system, and a high standard of living, which contributes to its higher cost of living.

However, Jordan's economy is growing, and the country is investing in various sectors, including tourism and technology.
