[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Israel has a diverse climate, ranging from the **Mediterranean climate** in the north and center to the **desert climate** in the south. The country experiences two main seasons: a dry season from April to October and a wet season from November to March. The dry season is characterized by hot and dry weather, while the wet season is marked by mild temperatures and rainfall. The seasons have a significant impact on travel, with the dry season being the peak tourist season and the wet season being the low season. However, the spring and autumn months offer a pleasant climate, making them ideal for outdoor activities such as hiking and sightseeing.

The country's climate zones also play a crucial role in determining the best time to visit. The **coastal region** has a milder climate compared to the **mountainous region**, which can be cooler and more prone to rainfall. The **desert region**, on the other hand, is extremely hot during the summer months and cold during the winter months. Understanding the different climate zones and seasons can help visitors plan their trip accordingly and make the most of their time in Israel.

In addition to the climate, the seasons also affect the crowds and prices. The peak season, which coincides with the dry season, is the busiest time of the year, with high prices and large crowds. In contrast, the low season, which coincides with the wet season, is less crowded and offers lower prices, making it a good option for budget-conscious travelers. However, some attractions and tourist sites may be closed or operate on reduced hours during the low season.
