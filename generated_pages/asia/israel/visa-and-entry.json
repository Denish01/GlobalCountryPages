The country grants visa-free access to citizens of around 100 countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and many European nations. However, the requirements and regulations can vary depending on the nationality and purpose of the visit. Visitors from eligible countries can stay in Israel for up to three months, while others may need to apply for a visa in advance.\n\nThe visa policy of Israel is designed to balance the need to control the flow of visitors with the desire to promote tourism and economic development. The country has a complex geopolitical situation, and its visa policy reflects this. Certain nationalities may face more stringent requirements or restrictions, while others may be eligible for special programs or exemptions. It is essential to check the current requirements and regulations before planning a trip to Israel.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | No | Tourist | 90 days | No extension required, but must have a valid passport |\n| UK Citizens | No | Tourist | 90 days | No extension required, but must have a valid passport |\n| EU Citizens | No | Tourist | 90 days | No extension required, but must have a valid passport |\n| Canadian Citizens | No | Tourist | 90 days | No extension required, but must have a valid passport |\n| Australian Citizens | No | Tourist | 90 days | No extension required, but must have a valid passport |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | eVisa | 30 days | Must apply online in advance, and have a valid passport |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Tourist | 30 days | Must apply in advance, and have a valid passport and hotel reservation |\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists from eligible countries can enter Israel without a visa and stay for up to three months.
