[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Israel's housing market is highly competitive, with a strong demand for rental properties, particularly in the city centers of **Tel Aviv** and **Jerusalem**. The typical lease term is one year, with a two-month deposit required, which is usually refundable at the end of the lease. Tenant rights are protected by law, with a **rent control** system in place to prevent excessive rent increases. Compared to its regional neighbors, Israel's housing costs are relatively high, with prices similar to those in **Lebanon** and **Jordan**, but higher than in **Egypt** and **Syria**. The housing market is also influenced by the country's high **inflation rate** of 3.1%, which can affect the affordability of housing for both locals and expats.

The rental market in Israel is characterized by a shortage of available properties, particularly in the city centers, which can drive up prices. However, there are also many affordable options available in the suburbs and outer neighborhoods, which can offer a more **affordable** and **relaxed** lifestyle. Expats and foreigners can find a wide range of housing options, from **furnished apartments** to **unfurnished villas**, depending on their budget and preferences. It is essential to research the local market, work with a reputable **real estate agent**, and carefully review the lease agreement before signing to ensure a smooth and successful rental experience.
