# Israel Visa & Entry Requirements

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Israel before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Israel has a moderate visa policy, allowing citizens of many countries to enter without a visa or with a visa on arrival. The country grants visa-free access to citizens of around 100 countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and many European nations. However, the requirements and regulations can vary depending on the nationality and purpose of the visit. Visitors from eligible countries can stay in Israel for up to three months, while others may need to apply for a visa in advance.

The visa policy of Israel is designed to balance the need to control the flow of visitors with the desire to promote tourism and economic development. The country has a complex geopolitical situation, and its visa policy reflects this. Certain nationalities may face more stringent requirements or restrictions, while others may be eligible for special programs or exemptions. It is essential to check the current requirements and regulations before planning a trip to Israel.

The main entry points to Israel are Ben Gurion Airport (TLV) near Tel Aviv, and the land borders with Jordan and Egypt. Upon arrival, visitors must go through immigration and customs, where they will be required to present their travel documents and answer questions about their stay. The process can take around 30 minutes to an hour, depending on the time of day and the number of passengers. Visitors may also be required to undergo security screening or questioning, especially if they have a complex travel history or are traveling from a country with restricted relations with Israel.

At the land borders, the process is similar, but visitors may need to present additional documentation, such as a valid driving license or car insurance. The border crossings can be busy, especially during peak travel seasons, so it is essential to plan ahead and allow sufficient time for the crossing.
