[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The property market in Bhutan is relatively small and primarily driven by domestic demand. The market is characterized by a lack of supply, particularly in the capital city of Thimphu, which has led to an increase in prices over the past few years. The government has implemented various measures to control the market and ensure that **affordability** is maintained for locals. The urban areas, such as Thimphu and Paro, tend to have higher prices compared to rural areas, where prices are generally lower. The price trajectory is expected to continue to rise, driven by the growing demand for housing and limited supply.

The market is also influenced by the government's **sustainable development** policies, which aim to balance economic growth with environmental and social considerations. This has led to a focus on **eco-tourism** and **cultural preservation**, which in turn has driven demand for properties in areas with natural beauty and cultural significance. The rural areas, such as Punakha and Bumthang, are becoming increasingly popular with tourists and locals alike, driven by their natural beauty and rich cultural heritage.

The government has also implemented various initiatives to promote **affordable housing**, including the development of new housing estates and the provision of subsidies for low-income families. However, the market remains largely driven by domestic demand, and the government's restrictions on foreign ownership have limited the involvement of international investors.
