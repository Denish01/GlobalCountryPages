# The Truth About Bhutan - History & Real Facts

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
Bhutan, a sovereign country located in Asia, has a rich and unique history. The country was founded in the 17th century by **Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal**, a Tibetan lama who unified the various warring factions in the region. In 1651, Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal established the **dual system of government**, which consisted of a spiritual leader, known as the Je Khenpo, and a temporal leader, known as the Druk Desi. This system of government remained in place until the mid-20th century.

Bhutan's independence was formally recognized by the British in 1910, with the signing of the **Treaty of Punakha**. The treaty established Bhutan as a sovereign state, with the British providing guidance on foreign affairs. In 1949, Bhutan signed a **treaty of friendship** with India, which replaced the earlier treaty with the British. This treaty established a close relationship between Bhutan and India, with India providing support for Bhutan's development and defense.

Bhutan became a member of the **United Nations** in 1971, and since then, it has been a member of various international organizations. The country has also been a member of the **South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)** since its inception in 1985. Bhutan's monarch, the **Druk Gyalpo (King)**, serves as the head of state, while the **Prime Minister** is the head of government.

The country's **monarchy** was established in 1907, with the coronation of **Ugyen Wangchuck** as the first king of Bhutan. The monarchy has played a significant role in Bhutan's development, with the current king, **Jigme Singye Wangchuck**, introducing the concept of **Gross National Happiness (GNH)** as an alternative to Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This approach prioritizes the well-being of citizens and the environment, and has been recognized internationally as a unique and innovative approach to development.
