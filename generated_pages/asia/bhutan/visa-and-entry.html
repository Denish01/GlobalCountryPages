        <h2>Visa Policy Overview</h2>
        <p>Bhutan has a moderate visa policy, with a focus on sustainable tourism and cultural preservation. The country aims to strike a balance between welcoming visitors and protecting its unique environment and traditions. Citizens of only a few countries, including India, can enter Bhutan without a visa, while others need to obtain a visa in advance or on arrival. The government has introduced various measures to regulate tourism, including a daily tariff and a requirement for travelers to book their tours through a licensed tour operator.</p>
        <p>Bhutan's visa policy is designed to promote responsible tourism and ensure that visitors respect the country's customs and environment. The government has set a limit on the number of tourists allowed to enter the country each year, and visitors are required to pay a daily tariff that includes a sustainable development fee. This fee is used to fund various development projects, including education, healthcare, and infrastructure development. Overall, Bhutan's visa policy is aimed at preserving the country's unique culture and environment while still allowing visitors to experience its beauty and hospitality.</p>
