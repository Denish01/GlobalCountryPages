[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Bhutan's utility infrastructure is relatively underdeveloped, with most services provided by the government-owned Bhutan Power Corporation (BPC) and the Department of Public Health Engineering. The cost of utilities in Bhutan can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher costs during the winter months due to increased electricity demand for heating. The government has implemented measures to stabilize prices, but costs can still vary depending on usage and location.

The quality of utility services in Bhutan is generally good, with reliable access to electricity, water, and sanitation in urban areas. However, rural areas may experience more frequent outages and disruptions to services. The government is working to improve the utility infrastructure, with plans to increase the use of renewable energy sources and expand access to services in rural areas.
