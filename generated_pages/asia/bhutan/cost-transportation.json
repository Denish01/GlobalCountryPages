The country's rugged terrain and limited road network make it challenging to establish an efficient public transit system. However, the government has been investing in improving the road network and promoting sustainable transportation options. In urban areas like Thimphu, there are some public buses and taxis available, but the frequency and coverage can be limited.\n\nThe main transportation modes in Bhutan include buses, taxis, and private vehicles. Buses are the most affordable option, but they can be crowded and uncomfortable. Taxis are widely available, but fares can be high, especially for longer distances. Private vehicles are becoming increasingly popular, but the cost of fuel and maintenance can be expensive. Many tourists also opt for renting cars or booking private transfers, which can be a convenient but costly option.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.50 | $15 | Limited coverage, frequent delays |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $1-$2 | N/A | Limited routes, often crowded |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $2 | $0.50 | $5-$10 | Fares can be negotiated |\n| Ride-Hailing App | N/A | N/A | N/A | Limited options, not widely available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$30 | To Thimphu city center |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.10 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$60 | Economy car, including fuel |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $0.50-$1 | Limited parking options |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $2-$5 | Limited toll roads |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$20 | Limited frequency, scenic routes |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-$200 | Typical route, Paro to Trashigang |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider using public buses or shared taxis, which can be significantly cheaper than private taxis or car rentals.\n- Negotiate taxi fares before starting your journey, as meters are not always used.\n- Use reputable taxi services or book private transfers in advance to ensure safety and reliability.\n- Consider renting a car or booking a private transfer for long-distance journeys, as public transportation options can be limited.\n- Be aware of the limited parking options and potential traffic congestion in urban areas.\n- Download local apps, such as Bhutan Taxi or Bhutan Transport, to book taxis or check schedules, although options may be limited.",
