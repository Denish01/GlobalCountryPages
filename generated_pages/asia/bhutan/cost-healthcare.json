The public healthcare system is generally of good quality, with well-trained doctors and nurses, and modern medical facilities. However, the system can be overwhelmed at times, particularly in rural areas. For foreigners, the quality of healthcare can vary, and private medical facilities may offer better services, but at a higher cost. It is recommended that foreigners have health insurance that covers them in Bhutan, as medical evacuation to other countries can be expensive.\n\nThe healthcare system in Bhutan is designed to provide universal access to healthcare, with a network of hospitals, clinics, and health centers throughout the country. However, the system can be bureaucratic, and waiting times can be long. Foreigners may need to pay out-of-pocket for medical services, and then claim reimbursement from their insurance provider. It is essential to research and understand the healthcare system in Bhutan before traveling to the country, and to consider purchasing health insurance that covers medical evacuation and other expenses.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $5-$10 | $20-$50 | Public hospitals may have long waiting times |\n| Specialist Consultation | $10-$20 | $50-$100 | Private hospitals may have more specialized services |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-$20 | $30-$50 | Private dental clinics may offer more comprehensive services |\n| Eye Exam | $5-$10 | $20-$30 | Public hospitals may have limited eye care services |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $30-$50 | Private labs may offer faster test results |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $20-$50 | Public hospitals may have limited emergency services |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $20-$50 | Private hospitals may offer more comfortable accommodations |\n| Basic Surgery | $100-$500 | Public hospitals may have limited surgical services |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $100-$200 | Private hospitals may offer more comprehensive maternity services |\n| MRI Scan | $100-$200 | Private hospitals may have more advanced imaging services |\n| X-Ray | $10-$20 | Public hospitals may have limited imaging services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Public hospital services, basic medical care |\n| Comprehensive Private | $50-$100 | Private hospital services, specialized care, medical evacuation |\n| International / Expat | $100-$200 | Global medical coverage, emergency evacuation, comprehensive services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Common medications such as pain relievers and antibiotics can cost between $5-$10\n- Prescription medications may require a doctor's prescription, and can cost between $10-$20\n- Pharmacy availability is generally good in urban areas, but may be limited in rural areas\n- Over-the-counter medications are widely available, but may not include all international brands\n- Some medications may be subsidized by the government, making them more affordable for citizens\n- It is recommended to bring any prescription medications with you when traveling to Bhutan, as availability may be limited\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the emergency number, 112, or seek immediate medical attention at the nearest hospital.
