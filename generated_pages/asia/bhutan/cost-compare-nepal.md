[SECTION] Overview: Bhutan vs Nepal [/SECTION]
Bhutan and Nepal are two neighboring countries in the Himalayas with distinct cultural and economic profiles. Bhutan has a high GDP per capita and a relatively low inflation rate, indicating a stable economy with a high standard of living. In contrast, Nepal has a lower GDP per capita and a higher inflation rate, suggesting a more challenging economic environment. Overall, Nepal is generally cheaper than Bhutan, with a lower cost of living that can be attractive to expats, students, and travelers. The main reason for this difference is the smaller size and more limited economy of Bhutan, which can drive up prices for certain goods and services.

The economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in their cost of living. Bhutan has a unique approach to development, prioritizing **Gross National Happiness** over GDP growth, which can lead to higher prices for certain goods and services. Nepal, on the other hand, has a more traditional economy with a larger population and a more developed infrastructure, which can help keep costs lower. As a result, Nepal is generally around 20-30% cheaper than Bhutan, making it a more affordable option for those looking to live or travel in the region.
