[SECTION] Overview: Bhutan vs India [/SECTION]
Bhutan and India are two neighboring countries in Asia with distinct economic contexts. Bhutan, a small sovereign nation, has a unique approach to development, prioritizing **Gross National Happiness** over GDP growth. This approach has resulted in a relatively high cost of living, with a strong focus on sustainability and environmental conservation. In contrast, India is a large and diverse country with a rapidly growing economy, offering a wide range of options for expats and travelers. The cost of living in India is generally lower, with a more competitive market and a wider range of affordable options.

The main difference in cost levels between Bhutan and India is due to the former's limited economy and reliance on imports. Bhutan's government also imposes a **daily tariff** on tourists, which can add to the overall cost of visiting the country. However, this tariff also helps to fund the country's conservation efforts and sustainable development initiatives. In India, the cost of living varies greatly depending on the region, with larger cities like Mumbai and Delhi tend to be more expensive than smaller towns and rural areas. Overall, India offers a more affordable option for those looking to live or travel in Asia, while Bhutan provides a unique and exclusive experience for those willing to pay a premium.
