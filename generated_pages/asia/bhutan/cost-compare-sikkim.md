[SECTION] Overview: Bhutan vs Sikkim [/SECTION]
Bhutan and Sikkim are two neighboring regions in the Himalayas, with distinct cultural and economic contexts. Bhutan is a sovereign country with a unique approach to development, prioritizing **Gross National Happiness** over GDP growth. In contrast, Sikkim is a state in India, with a more traditional economic setup. The cost of living in Bhutan is generally higher due to its remote location, limited infrastructure, and government-imposed **tariffs** on imported goods. Sikkim, on the other hand, benefits from its proximity to major Indian cities and a more developed transportation network.

The economic context of the two regions also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Bhutan's economy is primarily driven by **hydropower** and **tourism**, with a growing focus on **sustainable development**. Sikkim's economy, while also reliant on tourism, has a more diversified base, with significant contributions from **agriculture** and **manufacturing**. As a result, Sikkim tends to have lower prices for everyday items, making it a more affordable option for expats and travelers. However, Bhutan's unique cultural experiences and pristine natural beauty may justify the higher costs for some visitors.
