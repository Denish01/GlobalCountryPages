The population growth rate is around 1.1%, which is relatively low compared to other countries in the region. The country is experiencing a gradual shift towards urbanization, with around 41.4% of the population living in urban areas. The population density is relatively low, with an average of 20.5 people per square kilometer. Bhutan's population is expected to continue growing, albeit at a slow rate, with projections suggesting that the population will reach around 1 million by 2030.\n\nThe country's population growth is largely driven by a decline in mortality rates, particularly among children and infants, as well as an increase in life expectancy. However, the total fertility rate has been declining in recent years, with an average of 1.9 children per woman. This decline in fertility rates is largely attributed to improvements in education and family planning services, particularly among women. The government has implemented various initiatives to promote family planning and reproductive health, which have contributed to the decline in fertility rates.\n\nBhutan's population is also characterized by a significant youth demographic, with around 26% of the population under the age of 15.
