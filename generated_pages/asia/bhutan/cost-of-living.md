[SECTION] How Expensive Is Bhutan? [/SECTION]
Bhutan is a moderately priced country to visit or live in, with a cost of living that is relatively higher than its neighboring countries, India and China. This is due to the government's efforts to maintain a high standard of living and preserve the country's unique culture and environment. The cost of living in Bhutan is also influenced by its remote location and limited connectivity, which can drive up the prices of imported goods and services. However, the country's stunning natural beauty, rich culture, and friendly people make it a unique and rewarding destination for travelers and expats.

Compared to other countries in Asia, Bhutan is more expensive than countries like Nepal and Cambodia, but less expensive than countries like Japan and Singapore. The government's policy of "high-value, low-impact" tourism also means that visitors are required to pay a daily tariff, which includes accommodation, food, and transportation, and can range from $200 to $250 per person per day. This tariff helps to support the country's sustainable tourism initiatives and ensures that visitors have a high-quality and authentic experience.
