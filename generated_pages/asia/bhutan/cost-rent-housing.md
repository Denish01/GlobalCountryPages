[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Bhutan's rental market is relatively small and mostly catered to locals, with a limited number of apartments and houses available for rent, especially in the capital city Thimphu. Typical lease terms range from 6 months to 1 year, with a deposit requirement of 1-2 months' rent. Tenant rights are protected by the **Bhutanese laws**, which require landlords to provide a written contract and maintain the property. Compared to regional neighbors, Bhutan's housing costs are relatively high, especially in Thimphu, due to the country's unique **Gross National Happiness** approach to development, which prioritizes sustainable and environmentally-friendly practices.

The rental market in Bhutan is also influenced by the government's **controlled economy** policies, which aim to maintain a balance between economic growth and social welfare. As a result, rent prices are relatively stable, and **inflation** is kept under control, with an inflation rate of 2.8% in 2024. However, this also means that the rental market can be quite **competitive**, especially for foreigners and expats, who may need to navigate the local **bureaucracy** to secure a rental property.
