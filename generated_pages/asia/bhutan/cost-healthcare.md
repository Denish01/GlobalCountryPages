[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Bhutan's healthcare system is primarily public, with the government providing free or low-cost medical services to its citizens. The public healthcare system is generally of good quality, with well-trained doctors and nurses, and modern medical facilities. However, the system can be overwhelmed at times, particularly in rural areas. For foreigners, the quality of healthcare can vary, and private medical facilities may offer better services, but at a higher cost. It is recommended that foreigners have health insurance that covers them in Bhutan, as medical evacuation to other countries can be expensive.

The healthcare system in Bhutan is designed to provide universal access to healthcare, with a network of hospitals, clinics, and health centers throughout the country. However, the system can be bureaucratic, and waiting times can be long. Foreigners may need to pay out-of-pocket for medical services, and then claim reimbursement from their insurance provider. It is essential to research and understand the healthcare system in Bhutan before traveling to the country, and to consider purchasing health insurance that covers medical evacuation and other expenses.
