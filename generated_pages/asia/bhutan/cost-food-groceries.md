[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Bhutan's food prices are relatively high compared to other countries in the region, due to the country's limited agricultural land, lack of direct access to the sea, and reliance on imports. The government's efforts to promote **organic farming** and **sustainable agriculture** have also contributed to higher food prices. However, the eating-out culture in Bhutan is not as prevalent as in other countries, with many locals preferring to cook at home. This is partly due to the fact that eating out is generally more expensive than cooking at home, with a meal at a mid-range restaurant costing around $15-$25 for two people.

The cost of food in Bhutan can vary depending on the location, with cities like Thimphu and Paro tend to have higher prices than rural areas. The country's **inflation rate** of 2.8% in 2024 has also had an impact on food prices, with some staples like rice and vegetables increasing in price. However, the government's efforts to control prices and promote local production have helped to keep prices relatively stable. For example, the government has implemented a **price control mechanism** to regulate the prices of essential commodities like rice, flour, and sugar.

[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]
The prices of groceries in Bhutan can vary significantly depending on whether you shop at a supermarket or a local market. Supermarkets tend to have higher prices due to the cost of importing goods, while local markets offer fresher produce at lower prices. For example, a kilogram of apples can cost around $3 at a supermarket, while at a local market, it can cost around $2. It's also worth noting that local markets often offer a wider variety of **local staples** like rice, flour, and vegetables, which are not only cheaper but also fresher.

When shopping at local markets, it's common to **haggle** over prices, especially for items like fruits and vegetables. Vendors often quote higher prices to tourists, so it's essential to have an idea of the going rate for a particular item before making a purchase. Supermarkets, on the other hand, tend to have fixed prices, but they may offer discounts or promotions on certain items. It's also worth noting that some supermarkets may offer a **loyalty program** or **membership card** that can help you save money on your grocery bills.
