[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Bhutan is a small, landlocked country located in the **Himalayan Mountains** of Asia. It is situated between two giant neighbors, China to the north and India to the south, east, and west. Bhutan's unique location has allowed it to maintain a distinct culture and identity, despite being surrounded by larger and more populous countries. The country's borders are defined by the Great Himalayan Range to the north and the **Brahmaputra River** valley to the south.

The country's strategic location has played a significant role in shaping its history and politics. Bhutan's proximity to the **Silk Road**, an ancient trade route that connected China with India and the Mediterranean, has facilitated the exchange of goods, ideas, and cultures. The country's borders have also been influenced by its history of interactions with neighboring countries, including the **Tibetan Empire** and the **British Empire**. Today, Bhutan's borders are marked by a series of passes, valleys, and rivers that separate it from China and India.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Bhutan's terrain is characterized by a diverse range of landscapes, from the **Himalayan Mountains** to the **Sub-Himalayan** foothills. The country is divided into three main regions: the **Great Himalayan Range**, the **Lower Himalayan Range**, and the **Duars**. The Great Himalayan Range, which includes the highest peak, **Gangkhar Puensum**, is a rugged and inaccessible region, with steep cliffs, glaciers, and snowfields. The Lower Himalayan Range is a more moderate region, with rolling hills, valleys, and rivers.

The Duars, which means "gate" in **Dzongkha**, is a region of fertile valleys and plains that borders India. This region is home to a variety of flora and fauna, including **tropical forests**, **grasslands**, and **wetlands**. Bhutan's terrain is also marked by a number of rivers, including the **Punakha River**, the **Wangdue River**, and the **Kuru River**, which flow through the country and provide water and transportation for the population. The country's diverse terrain and climate support a wide range of ecosystems, from **alpine meadows** to **tropical forests**.

The country's landscape is also dotted with a number of **valleys**, including the **Thimphu Valley**, the **Paro Valley**, and the **Punakha Valley**, which are home to the majority of the population. These valleys are fertile and productive, with a mix of **agriculture**, **horticulture**, and **animal husbandry**. The valleys are also home to a number of **dzongs**, or fortresses, which are a unique feature of Bhutanese architecture and serve as administrative centers, monasteries, and defensive structures.
