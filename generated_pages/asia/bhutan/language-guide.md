While many Bhutanese people can understand and speak some English, it is not as widely spoken as Dzongkha or other local languages.

The country's unique linguistic heritage is reflected in its rich cultural traditions and history. The **Tibetan script**, used to write Dzongkha, is an important part of Bhutan's cultural identity. The script is used in various aspects of Bhutanese life, including education, literature, and art. Bhutan's language policy aims to promote the use of Dzongkha as the primary language, while also recognizing the importance of other languages spoken in the country.

These languages are spoken by smaller communities and are an important part of the country's cultural heritage. Efforts are being made to preserve and promote these languages, including language documentation and education programs. Overall, Bhutan's linguistic landscape is a unique and important aspect of its cultural identity.
