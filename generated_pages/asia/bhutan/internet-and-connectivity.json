  "content": "In Bhutan, the internet is generally reliable in urban areas, but the quality and speed can vary significantly in rural regions, and tourists can easily get a SIM card from one of the main carriers at the airport or in major towns. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nAverage Internet Speed: 5 Mbps download\nMobile Network Coverage: Moderate\nMain Carriers: TashiCell, B-Mobile, Samden\nSIM Card Cost: 10 USD for tourist SIM\nWiFi Availability: Limited\n5G Available: No\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]\nThe internet in Bhutan has improved significantly over the past few years, with the government investing heavily in expanding mobile network coverage and increasing internet speeds. However, there is still a significant urban-rural divide, with internet speeds and reliability being much better in urban areas like Thimphu and Paro, compared to rural areas where mobile network coverage can be patchy and internet speeds are generally slower. The average internet speed in Bhutan is around 5 Mbps download, which is sufficient for basic browsing and social media, but can be slow for streaming and online gaming.\n\nDespite the challenges, the internet has become an essential part of daily life in Bhutan, with many businesses, schools, and government offices relying on it for communication and information. The government has also launched several initiatives to promote digital literacy and online safety, and to expand mobile network coverage to remote areas. However, the country's rugged terrain and limited infrastructure can make it difficult to maintain a stable and reliable internet connection, especially during the monsoon season when landslides and floods can disrupt mobile networks and internet services.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nTourists can easily get a SIM card from one of the main carriers, TashiCell or B-Mobile, at the airport or in major towns like Thimphu and Paro. To buy a SIM card, you will need to provide a valid passport and a copy of your visa, and the cost is around 10 USD for a tourist SIM. The SIM card will come with a preloaded data plan, and you can top up your account at any of the carrier's retail outlets or online. It's recommended to buy a SIM card from a authorized retailer, as it will come with a valid registration and will be easier to use.\n\nThe main carriers, TashiCell and B-Mobile, offer a range of data plans, including tourist-friendly plans that offer a set amount of data and validity period. The prices and data allowances vary depending on the carrier and the plan, but you can expect to pay around 10-20 USD for a plan with 1-2 GB of data and a validity period of 7-10 days.\n\n[TABLE]\n| Carrier | Tourist Plan | Data | Price (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| TashiCell | Tourist Plan | 1 GB | 10 | Valid for 7 days |\n| B-Mobile | Tourist Plan | 2 GB | 15 | Valid for 10 days |\n| Samden | Data Plan | 5 GB | 20 | Valid for 15 days |\n| TashiCell | Add-on Plan | 1 GB | 5 | Valid for 3 days |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] WiFi Availability [/SECTION]\n- Hotel WiFi quality is generally good, with most hotels offering free WiFi to their guests, but the speed and reliability can vary depending on the hotel and its location.\n- Cafe WiFi culture is not very common in Bhutan, but some of the modern cafes in Thimphu and Paro offer free WiFi to their customers.\n- Coworking spaces are limited in Bhutan, but there are a few options in Thimphu and Paro that offer shared office space and reliable internet connectivity.\n- Public WiFi is limited in Bhutan, but some of the major towns like Thimphu and Paro have public WiFi hotspots that offer free internet access.\n- Some of the restaurants and bars in major towns also offer free WiFi to their customers, but the speed and reliability can vary depending on the location and the time of day.\n\n[SECTION] For Remote Workers [/SECTION]\n- Coworking spaces like the Thimphu Coworking Space and the Paro Coworking Space offer shared office space and reliable internet connectivity, making them a good option for remote workers.\n- Reliable cafe chains like the Ambient Cafe and the Art Cafe offer free WiFi and a comfortable working environment, making them a good option for remote workers who prefer to work from a cafe.\n- Backup internet options like mobile hotspots and portable WiFi routers are available for rent, and can be a good option for remote workers who need a reliable internet connection.\n- VPNs are not strictly necessary in Bhutan, but they can be useful for accessing **geo-restricted content** and for maintaining online security.\n- Some of the hotels and resorts in Bhutan also offer **remote work** packages that include accommodation, meals, and internet connectivity, making them a good option for remote workers who prefer to work from a hotel or resort.\n\n[SECTION] Tips & Warnings [/SECTION]\n- Internet censorship is not a major issue in Bhutan, but some websites and online services may be blocked due to **content restrictions**.\n- **Social media** and online messaging apps are widely used in Bhutan, but some of the more popular platforms may be blocked or restricted due to **government regulations**.\n- VPNs can be useful for accessing **geo-restricted content** and for maintaining online security, but they may not be necessary for general browsing and social media.\n- Roaming alternatives like **eSIMs** and **portable WiFi routers** are available, and can be a good option for tourists who prefer not to buy a local SIM card.\n- Online **payment systems** like credit cards and PayPal are widely accepted in Bhutan, but it's always a good idea to have some local cash on hand, especially when traveling to rural areas.\n- **Cybersecurity** is an important issue in Bhutan, and tourists should take precautions to protect themselves from online threats like **phishing** and **malware**.",
