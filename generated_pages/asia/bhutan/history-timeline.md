The history of Bhutan is a rich and complex narrative that spans over 1,000 years, from the earliest known settlements to the modern era, marked by the country's unique cultural heritage and its quest for independence and sovereignty.

[SECTION] Historical Overview [/SECTION]
Bhutan's history began with the arrival of Buddhism in the 7th century, which had a profound impact on the country's development, shaping its culture, politics, and society. The country's early history was marked by the rise and fall of various kingdoms and dynasties, including the **Pala Empire** and the **Tibetan Empire**, which influenced Bhutan's language, architecture, and art. In the 17th century, Bhutan was unified under the **Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal**, a Tibetan lama who introduced the **Vajrayana Buddhism** and established the country's unique system of government, which combined spiritual and temporal powers. The 19th and 20th centuries saw Bhutan's interactions with European colonial powers, particularly Britain, which led to the signing of the **Treaty of Punakha** in 1910, recognizing Bhutan's sovereignty.

During the 20th century, Bhutan underwent significant modernization efforts, including the introduction of education, healthcare, and infrastructure development, under the leadership of the **Third King**, **Jigme Dorji Wangchuck**. The country also maintained its independence and sovereignty, despite being surrounded by powerful neighbors, including China and India.
