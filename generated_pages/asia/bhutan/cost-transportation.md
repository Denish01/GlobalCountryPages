[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Bhutan has a relatively underdeveloped public transportation system, with most people relying on taxis, buses, and private vehicles to get around. The country's rugged terrain and limited road network make it challenging to establish an efficient public transit system. However, the government has been investing in improving the road network and promoting sustainable transportation options. In urban areas like Thimphu, there are some public buses and taxis available, but the frequency and coverage can be limited.

The main transportation modes in Bhutan include buses, taxis, and private vehicles. Buses are the most affordable option, but they can be crowded and uncomfortable. Taxis are widely available, but fares can be high, especially for longer distances. Private vehicles are becoming increasingly popular, but the cost of fuel and maintenance can be expensive. Many tourists also opt for renting cars or booking private transfers, which can be a convenient but costly option.
