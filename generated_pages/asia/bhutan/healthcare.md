[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Bhutan's healthcare system is based on a combination of traditional and modern medicine, with a strong emphasis on **preventive care** and **community health**. The system is largely publicly funded, with the government providing access to healthcare services for all citizens. However, there are also private hospitals and clinics, particularly in the capital city of Thimphu, which offer a higher level of care and are often used by foreigners and affluent locals. The quality of care in Bhutan is generally good, with well-trained doctors and nurses, but the availability of specialized care and equipment can be limited, especially in rural areas.

The healthcare system in Bhutan is structured into three levels of care: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Primary care is provided by **Basic Health Units** (BHUs) and **Outreach Clinics**, which offer basic medical care and preventive services. Secondary care is provided by **District Hospitals**, which offer more specialized care and emergency services. Tertiary care is provided by **Referral Hospitals**, which offer specialized care and advanced medical services. Urban areas, such as Thimphu, have better access to healthcare services, while rural areas often rely on traditional medicine and community health workers.

Despite the progress made in recent years, Bhutan's healthcare system still faces challenges, including a shortage of specialized doctors and nurses, limited access to medical equipment and supplies, and a high burden of **communicable diseases**, such as tuberculosis and malaria. However, the government is working to address these challenges, with a focus on **health system strengthening** and **health workforce development**.
