Bhutan, a small sovereign nation in the Himalayas, has a unique approach to economic development, prioritizing **Gross National Happiness** over GDP growth. As a result, the country has maintained a high level of **socio-economic development**, with a strong focus on **sustainability** and **environmental conservation**. In contrast, China is a global economic powerhouse, with a vast and diverse economy that is driven by **industrialization** and **urbanization**. The cost of living in Bhutan is generally higher than in China, due to the country's remote location, limited **infrastructure**, and high **import costs**.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Bhutan's economy is largely driven by **agriculture** and **tourism**, with a growing **hydroelectric power** sector. The country's **currency**, the Bhutanese ngultrum (BTN), is pegged to the Indian rupee, which can affect the cost of imports. In contrast, China's economy is driven by **manufacturing**, **exports**, and **services**, with a large and growing **middle class**. The Chinese yuan (RMB) is the official currency, and the country has a well-developed **financial system**.
