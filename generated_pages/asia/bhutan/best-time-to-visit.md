[CALLOUT] Best months to visit Bhutan: September to November and March to May. Peak season: March to May and September to November. Budget season: December to February and June to August.

[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Bhutan has a varied climate, with three main climate zones: the subtropical zone in the south, the temperate zone in the central region, and the alpine zone in the north. The country experiences a dry season from October to April and a wet season from May to September. The dry season is the best time to visit Bhutan, as the weather is generally mild and sunny, making it ideal for trekking and sightseeing. The wet season, on the other hand, can be challenging for travel, as the heavy rainfall can cause landslides and flooding, and some trekking routes may be closed.

The dry season is further divided into two sub-seasons: the spring season, which runs from March to May, and the autumn season, which runs from September to November. The spring season is characterized by mild temperatures and blooming flowers, while the autumn season is marked by comfortable temperatures and clear skies. Both seasons are ideal for trekking, sightseeing, and attending festivals.

The wet season, which runs from May to September, is the low season for tourism in Bhutan. However, it's also the best time to see the country's lush green landscapes and enjoy white-water rafting and other water sports. If you're planning to visit Bhutan during the wet season, it's essential to be prepared for the rain and potential landslides, and to book your accommodations and tours in advance.
