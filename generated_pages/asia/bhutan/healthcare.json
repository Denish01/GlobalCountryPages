The system is largely publicly funded, with the government providing access to healthcare services for all citizens. However, there are also private hospitals and clinics, particularly in the capital city of Thimphu, which offer a higher level of care and are often used by foreigners and affluent locals. The quality of care in Bhutan is generally good, with well-trained doctors and nurses, but the availability of specialized care and equipment can be limited, especially in rural areas.\n\nThe healthcare system in Bhutan is structured into three levels of care: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Primary care is provided by **Basic Health Units** (BHUs) and **Outreach Clinics**, which offer basic medical care and preventive services. Secondary care is provided by **District Hospitals**, which offer more specialized care and emergency services. Tertiary care is provided by **Referral Hospitals**, which offer specialized care and advanced medical services. Urban areas, such as Thimphu, have better access to healthcare services, while rural areas often rely on traditional medicine and community health workers.\n\nDespite the progress made in recent years, Bhutan's healthcare system still faces challenges, including a shortage of specialized doctors and nurses, limited access to medical equipment and supplies, and a high burden of **communicable diseases**, such as tuberculosis and malaria. However, the government is working to address these challenges, with a focus on **health system strengthening** and **health workforce development**.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Jigme Dorji Wangchuck National Referral Hospital | Thimphu | Public | General medicine, surgery, pediatrics | Yes |\n| Thimphu Hospital | Thimphu | Private | General medicine, surgery, cardiology | Yes |\n| Mongar Hospital | Mongar | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Limited |\n| Trashigang Hospital | Trashigang | Public | General medicine, surgery, pediatrics | Limited |\n| Phuentsholing General Hospital | Phuentsholing | Public | General medicine, surgery, emergency medicine | Yes |\n| Bhutan Hospital | Thimphu | Private | General medicine, surgery, dentistry | Yes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Travel insurance** is recommended for foreigners visiting Bhutan, as it can provide coverage for medical emergencies and evacuation.\n- **Local insurance options** are available, including the **Bhutan Insurance Limited**, which offers health insurance plans for citizens and foreigners.\n- **Expats** can purchase private health insurance plans, which often include coverage for medical care in Bhutan and evacuation to other countries.\n- **Costs** for health insurance in Bhutan can vary, depending on the type of plan and the provider.\n- **Government health insurance** is available for citizens, which provides access to public healthcare services.\n- **Private health insurance** is also available, which can provide access to private healthcare services and specialized care.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Medications** are widely available in Bhutan, including both traditional and modern medicines.\n- **Prescription requirements** vary, depending on the type of medication and the provider.\n- **Common brands** of medications are available, including **Indian** and **European** brands.\n- **Costs** for medications in Bhutan can be relatively high, especially for specialized medications.\n- **Pharmacy access** is moderate, with pharmacies available in urban areas, but limited in rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Required vaccinations** for travel to Bhutan include **hepatitis A**, **hepatitis B**, and **typhoid**.\n- **Recommended vaccinations** include **rabies**, **Japanese encephalitis**, and ** meningitis**.\n- **Endemic diseases** in Bhutan include **malaria**, **dengue fever**, and **cholera**.\n- **Water safety** is a concern in Bhutan, with **water-borne illnesses** common in rural areas.\n- **Food safety** is also a concern, with **food-borne illnesses** common in urban areas.\n- **Altitude sickness** is a risk in Bhutan, particularly in high-altitude areas.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **Medical tourism** is not a major industry in Bhutan, but the country is working to develop its healthcare sector to attract foreign patients.\n- **Popular procedures** for medical tourism in Bhutan include **traditional medicine** and **ayurvedic treatments**.\n- **Accredited hospitals** in Bhutan include the **Jigme Dorji Wangchuck National Referral Hospital** and the **Thimphu Hospital**.\n- **Cost savings** for medical tourism in Bhutan can be significant, particularly for traditional medicine and ayurvedic treatments.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- **Emergency number** in Bhutan is **112**, which can be used to access emergency services, including ambulance and police.\n- **Ambulance reliability** in Bhutan can be limited, particularly in rural areas.\n- **Nearest hospitals** can be found in urban areas, such as Thimphu, and can provide emergency care and specialized services.\n- **Insurance claims** can be made through local insurance providers or travel insurance companies.\n- **Emergency evacuation** may be necessary in severe cases, and can be arranged through insurance providers or private companies.",
