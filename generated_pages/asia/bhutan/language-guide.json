Regional dialects, such as **Lhotshamkha** and **Tshangla**, are also spoken in various parts of the country. Additionally, **Nepali** and **Sharchop** are widely spoken, particularly in the southern and eastern regions. English is becoming increasingly popular, particularly among the younger population and those in the tourism industry, but overall English proficiency is still moderate. While many Bhutanese people can understand and speak some English, it is not as widely spoken as Dzongkha or other local languages.\n\nThe country's unique linguistic heritage is reflected in its rich cultural traditions and history. The **Tibetan script**, used to write Dzongkha, is an important part of Bhutan's cultural identity. The script is used in various aspects of Bhutanese life, including education, literature, and art. Bhutan's language policy aims to promote the use of Dzongkha as the primary language, while also recognizing the importance of other languages spoken in the country.\n\nBhutan's linguistic diversity is also reflected in its minority languages, such as **Brokkat** and **Khengkha**. These languages are spoken by smaller communities and are an important part of the country's cultural heritage. Efforts are being made to preserve and promote these languages, including language documentation and education programs. Overall, Bhutan's linguistic landscape is a unique and important aspect of its cultural identity.\n\n[SECTION] Essential Phrases [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| English | Local Language | Pronunciation | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hello | Kuzu zangpo | koo-zoo zang-po | formal |\n| Hello (informal) | Kuzu | koo-zoo | informal |\n| Thank you | Kaadinchey | kah-deen-cheh | formal |\n| Please | Chhagay | chah-gah-y | formal |\n| Yes / No | Nga / Mi | ngah / mee | formal |\n| Excuse me | Sumdang | soom-dang | formal |\n| How much? | Gademchi? | gah-dehm-chee | formal |\n| Where is...? | Ga chi mo? | gah chee moh | formal |\n| I don't understand | Nga sheshe | ngah sheh-sheh | formal |\n| Do you speak English? | Chhoe ke tsang ngala? | cho-eh keh tsahng ngah-lah | formal |\n| Help! | Thuenmo! | thuen-moh | formal |\n| Goodbye | Lekso | leh-ksoh | formal |\n| Sorry | Sumdang | soom-dang | formal |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Numbers & Bargaining [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Number | Local Word | Pronunciation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Chi | chee |\n| 2 | Nyi | nee |\n| 3 | Sum | soom |\n| 4 | Zhi | zhee |\n| 5 | Nga | ngah |\n| 6 | Dru | droo |\n| 7 | Duen | duhn |\n| 8 | Gye | gyeh |\n| 9 | Gu | goo |\n| 10 | Chu | choo |\n| 100 | Gya | gyah |\n| 1000 | Azhi | ah-zhee |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Communication Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be respectful and polite when interacting with locals, using formal language and titles such as **Dasho** or **Aum**.\n- Avoid using gestures with the left hand, as it is considered impolite.\n- Remove your shoes when entering temples or homes, as a sign of respect.\n- Use both hands when giving or receiving something, as using one hand can be seen as impolite.\n- Avoid public displays of affection, as they are generally frowned upon in Bhutanese culture.\n- Learn some basic Dzongkha phrases, such as **Kuzu zangpo** (hello) and **Kaadinchey** (thank you), to show respect for the local culture.\n- Be patient and calm when communicating, as Bhutanese people tend to value harmony and avoid conflict.\n\n[SECTION] Translation Tools & Resources [/SECTION]\n- Download the **Google Translate** app, which includes Dzongkha language support, to help with communication.\n- Carry a **phrasebook** or dictionary to help with basic phrases and vocabulary.\n- Take a **language course** or use online resources to learn Dzongkha before traveling to Bhutan.\n- Use **translation services** provided by hotels or tour operators to help with communication.\n- Learn about Bhutanese **cultural norms** and customs to avoid unintended offense and show respect for the local culture.",
