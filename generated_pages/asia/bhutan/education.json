Primary education lasts for seven years, from ages 6 to 12, and is compulsory for all children. Secondary education is divided into two stages: lower secondary, which lasts for four years, and upper secondary, which lasts for two years. Tertiary education is provided by various colleges and universities, including the Royal University of Bhutan, which is the oldest and largest university in the country. The quality of education in Bhutan is generally good, with a strong emphasis on preserving the country's unique culture and traditions. Public schools are free and widely available, but private schools are also popular, particularly among the wealthy.\n\nThe education system in Bhutan is designed to promote **Gross National Happiness**, which is the country's unique approach to development. This approach emphasizes the importance of spiritual and emotional well-being, as well as academic achievement. As a result, the education system in Bhutan places a strong emphasis on **mindfulness**, **meditation**, and **community service**, in addition to traditional academic subjects. The government has also implemented various initiatives to improve the quality of education, including the introduction of new curricula and teaching methods.\n\nDespite the many strengths of the education system in Bhutan, there are also some challenges. One of the main challenges is the lack of resources and infrastructure, particularly in rural areas. Many schools lack basic facilities such as libraries, laboratories, and computers, which can make it difficult for students to access quality education. Additionally, there is a shortage of qualified teachers, particularly in subjects such as science and mathematics.\n\n[SECTION] Top Universities [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| University | Location | Known For | Est.
