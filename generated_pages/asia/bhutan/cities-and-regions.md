[SECTION] How Bhutan Is Divided [/SECTION]
Bhutan is divided into 20 districts, also known as dzongkhags, which are further subdivided into 205 gewogs, or village blocks. The country's administrative structure is designed to balance the needs of its diverse population and geography. Each district has its own administrative office, known as a dzongkhag administration, which is responsible for implementing national policies and providing public services at the local level.

The districts are grouped into four main regions: the west, central, east, and south. These regions are not formal administrative entities, but rather a way to categorize the districts based on their geographic location and cultural characteristics. The regional classification helps to facilitate coordination and cooperation among the districts and provides a framework for national development planning.
