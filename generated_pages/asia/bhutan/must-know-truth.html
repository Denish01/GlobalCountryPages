        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Bhutan, a sovereign country located in Asia, has a rich and unique history. The country was founded in the 17th century by <strong>Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal</strong>, a Tibetan lama who unified the various warring factions in the region. In 1651, Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal established the <strong>dual system of government</strong>, which consisted of a spiritual leader, known as the Je Khenpo, and a temporal leader, known as the Druk Desi. This system of government remained in place until the mid-20th century.</p>
        <p>Bhutan's independence was formally recognized by the British in 1910, with the signing of the <strong>Treaty of Punakha</strong>. The treaty established Bhutan as a sovereign state, with the British providing guidance on foreign affairs. In 1949, Bhutan signed a <strong>treaty of friendship</strong> with India, which replaced the earlier treaty with the British. This treaty established a close relationship between Bhutan and India, with India providing support for Bhutan's development and defense.</p>
        <p>Bhutan became a member of the <strong>United Nations</strong> in 1971, and since then, it has been a member of various international organizations. The country has also been a member of the <strong>South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)</strong> since its inception in 1985. Bhutan's monarch, the <strong>Druk Gyalpo (King)</strong>, serves as the head of state, while the <strong>Prime Minister</strong> is the head of government.</p>
        <p>The country's <strong>monarchy</strong> was established in 1907, with the coronation of <strong>Ugyen Wangchuck</strong> as the first king of Bhutan. The monarchy has played a significant role in Bhutan's development, with the current king, <strong>Jigme Singye Wangchuck</strong>, introducing the concept of <strong>Gross National Happiness (GNH)</strong> as an alternative to Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This approach prioritizes the well-being of citizens and the environment, and has been recognized internationally as a unique and innovative approach to development.</p>
