[/SECTION]\nBhutan is a moderately priced country to visit or live in, with a cost of living that is relatively higher than its neighboring countries, India and China. This is due to the government's efforts to maintain a high standard of living and preserve the country's unique culture and environment. The cost of living in Bhutan is also influenced by its remote location and limited connectivity, which can drive up the prices of imported goods and services. However, the country's stunning natural beauty, rich culture, and friendly people make it a unique and rewarding destination for travelers and expats.\n\nCompared to other countries in Asia, Bhutan is more expensive than countries like Nepal and Cambodia, but less expensive than countries like Japan and Singapore. The government's policy of \"high-value, low-impact\" tourism also means that visitors are required to pay a daily tariff, which includes accommodation, food, and transportation, and can range from $200 to $250 per person per day. This tariff helps to support the country's sustainable tourism initiatives and ensures that visitors have a high-quality and authentic experience.\n\n[SECTION] Accommodation Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Price Range (USD/night) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Hostel/Budget | $10-20 | Basic facilities, shared rooms |\n| Mid-Range Hotel | $30-60 | Comfortable rooms, private bathrooms |\n| Luxury/Resort | $100-200 | High-end amenities, stunning views |\n| Apartment Rent (monthly) | $200-500 | City center, 1-2 bedrooms, furnished |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $3-5 |\n| Casual Restaurant | $10-20 |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $20-30 |\n| Fine Dining | $50-100 |\n| Beer (local) | $5-10 |\n| Coffee | $2-5 |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $1-2 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport | Cost (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Local bus/metro ride | $0.50-1 |\n| Taxi (per km) | $1-2 |\n| Domestic flight | $100-200 |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $1-2 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Breakdown [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Category | Budget ($) | Mid-Range ($) | Comfortable ($) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rent | 200 | 400 | 800 |\n| Food | 300 | 600 | 1,200 |\n| Transport | 100 | 200 | 400 |\n| Utilities | 50 | 100 | 200 |\n| Entertainment | 100 | 200 | 500 |\n| **Total** | **750** | **1,500** | **3,100** |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Money-Saving Tips [/SECTION]\n- Consider visiting during the off-season (December to February) when prices for accommodation and tours are lower.\n- Eat at local restaurants and try traditional Bhutanese dishes, which are often cheaper and more flavorful than Western cuisine.\n- Use public transportation or walk/bike whenever possible to save on taxi fares.\n- Avoid buying imported goods and opt for local products instead.\n- Negotiate prices when shopping at markets or from street vendors.\n- Consider staying in a homestay or guesthouse, which can be a more affordable and authentic option than a hotel.\n\nOverall, Bhutan is a unique and rewarding destination that offers a mix of natural beauty, culture, and adventure.
