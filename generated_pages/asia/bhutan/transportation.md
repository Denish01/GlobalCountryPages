[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Bhutan is a landlocked country located in the Himalayas, and the main entry point for international travelers is the Paro International Airport (PBH), which is located about 6 kilometers from Paro city. The airport receives direct flights from several neighboring countries, including India, Nepal, and Thailand, with Drukair and Bhutan Airlines being the primary carriers. If you are traveling from other parts of the world, you will likely need to fly into one of the major hubs in Asia, such as Delhi or Bangkok, and then connect to a flight to Paro. Additionally, it is also possible to enter Bhutan overland from India, with the main entry points being at Phuentsholing, Gelephu, and Samdrup Jongkhar.

For overland travel, you will need to obtain a special permit, which can be arranged through a licensed tour operator or the Bhutanese government. The journey by road can be long and arduous, but it offers a unique opportunity to see the countryside and experience the local culture. The border towns also offer a range of accommodation options, from budget-friendly guesthouses to luxury hotels. It is essential to research and plan carefully before embarking on an overland journey to Bhutan, as the process can be complex and time-consuming.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Bhutan has a limited domestic air network, with Drukair and Bhutan Airlines operating flights between Paro and several other domestic airports, including Bumthang, Gelephu, and Yongphulla. The main domestic routes connect Paro to the eastern and central parts of the country, with flights operating several times a week. Booking domestic flights in advance is highly recommended, as the demand for seats can be high, especially during the peak travel season. The cost of a domestic flight can range from $100 to $200, depending on the route and the time of year.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Bhutan does not have a rail network, and the country relies on roads and air transport to connect its major towns and cities. As a result, there are no trains or rail services available for domestic or international travel. The government has proposed several rail projects in the past, but none have come to fruition yet. In the meantime, travelers will need to rely on other modes of transportation, such as buses, taxis, and private vehicles, to get around the country.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Bhutan has an extensive network of buses and coaches that connect its major towns and cities. The buses are operated by the state-owned Royal Bhutan Transport Corporation and several private companies, offering a range of services from basic to luxury. The main routes connect Thimphu to Paro, Phuentsholing, and other major towns, with frequent departures throughout the day. The cost of a bus ticket can range from $5 to $20, depending on the route and the type of service. While the buses can be a convenient and affordable way to travel, the roads in Bhutan can be rough, and the journeys can be long and tiring.
