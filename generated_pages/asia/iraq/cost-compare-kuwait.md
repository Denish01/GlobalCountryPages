[SECTION] Overview: Iraq vs Kuwait [/SECTION]
The cost of living in Iraq and Kuwait varies significantly, reflecting the two countries' distinct economic contexts. Iraq, a developing country with a large population and a growing economy, has a lower cost of living compared to Kuwait, a small, oil-rich nation with a high standard of living. The main factors contributing to the difference in cost of living between the two countries are the prices of housing, food, and transportation. In general, Iraq offers a more affordable lifestyle, with lower prices for everyday expenses such as rent, groceries, and dining out.

The economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. Iraq's economy is primarily driven by the oil and gas sector, while Kuwait's economy is heavily reliant on oil exports. As a result, Kuwait has a higher GDP per capita and a more developed infrastructure, which contributes to its higher cost of living. However, Iraq's lower cost of living makes it an attractive option for expats, students, and retirees looking for an affordable lifestyle in the Middle East.
