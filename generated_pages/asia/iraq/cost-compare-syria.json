  "content": "Iraq is generally cheaper than Syria, with an overall cost of living difference of around 20-30%.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nIraq GDP per Capita (PPP): 14,849\nSyria GDP per Capita (PPP): 6,373\nIraq Inflation Rate: 6.9%\nSyria Inflation Rate: 28.1%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Iraq\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Iraq vs Syria [/SECTION]\nThe cost of living in Iraq and Syria varies significantly due to the economic context of each country. Iraq has a relatively stable economy, driven by its oil exports, while Syria is still recovering from a prolonged civil war. As a result, Iraq tends to have lower prices for many everyday items, including food, housing, and transportation. On average, Iraq is around 20-30% cheaper than Syria, making it a more affordable option for expats, students, and retirees.\n\nThe economic context of each country also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Iraq's economy is more diversified, with a growing private sector, while Syria's economy is still heavily reliant on government subsidies and international aid. This has led to a shortage of certain goods and services in Syria, driving up prices and making it more expensive for foreigners to live there. Additionally, the security situation in Syria is still unstable, which can increase the cost of living for those who require additional security measures.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Iraq (USD) | Syria (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 200 | 300 | 33% cheaper in Iraq |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 150 | 250 | 40% cheaper in Iraq |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 400 | 600 | 33% cheaper in Iraq |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Iraq (USD) | Syria (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 10 | 15 | 33% cheaper in Iraq |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 100 | 150 | 33% cheaper in Iraq |\n| Beer (500ml) | 5 | 10 | 50% cheaper in Iraq |\n| Coffee | 2 | 3 | 33% cheaper in Iraq |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Iraq (USD) | Syria (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 20 | 30 | 33% cheaper in Iraq |\n| Taxi (per km) | 1 | 2 | 50% cheaper in Iraq |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 0.5 | 1 | 50% cheaper in Iraq |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Iraq (USD) | Syria (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 50 | 100 | 50% cheaper in Iraq |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 30 | 50 | 40% cheaper in Iraq |\n| Mobile Plan | 10 | 20 | 50% cheaper in Iraq |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Iraq (USD) | Syria (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 500 | 750 | 33% savings in Iraq |\n| Mid-Range | 1,000 | 1,500 | 33% savings in Iraq |\n| Comfortable | 2,000 | 3,000 | 33% savings in Iraq |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Iraq is cheaper for:**\n- Rent and housing, with prices up to 40% lower than in Syria\n- Food and dining, with meal prices up to 50% lower than in Syria\n- Transportation, with fuel prices up to 50% lower than in Syria\n- Utilities and internet, with prices up to 50% lower than in Syria\n- **Syria is cheaper for:**\n- Certain luxury goods, such as high-end electronics and clothing\n- Travel and tourism, with many historical sites and cultural attractions\n- Education, with several reputable universities and language schools\n- Healthcare, with several modern hospitals and medical facilities\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nOverall, Iraq offers better value for money for most foreigners, with lower prices for everyday items and a more stable economy.
