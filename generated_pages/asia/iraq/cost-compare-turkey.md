[SECTION] Overview: Iraq vs Turkey [/SECTION]
The cost of living in Iraq and Turkey varies significantly due to differences in economic context, lifestyle, and purchasing power. Iraq has a lower GDP per capita and inflation rate compared to Turkey, which contributes to its lower cost of living. In general, Iraq offers a more affordable lifestyle, with lower prices for housing, food, and transportation. However, Turkey provides a more developed infrastructure, better healthcare, and a wider range of amenities, which may justify its higher costs for some expats and travelers.

The economic context of both countries also plays a crucial role in determining the cost of living. Iraq's economy is largely driven by oil exports, while Turkey has a more diversified economy with a strong focus on manufacturing, tourism, and services. This diversity contributes to Turkey's higher costs, but also provides a more stable and predictable environment for businesses and individuals. In contrast, Iraq's economy is more vulnerable to fluctuations in global oil prices, which can impact the cost of living and overall stability.
