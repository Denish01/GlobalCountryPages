Compulsory education in Iraq lasts for 12 years, from age 6 to 18, and is divided into primary and secondary education. International schools are also available in major cities like Baghdad and Erbil, offering a range of curricula, including **British**, **American**, and **International Baccalaureate**.\n\nDespite the challenges facing the education system in Iraq, there are efforts underway to improve the quality of education, including the introduction of new curricula and the training of teachers.

These organizations are working to improve access to education, particularly for disadvantaged groups, and to enhance the quality of education in Iraq. The education system in Iraq is also influenced by the country's cultural and societal norms, with a strong emphasis on traditional values and Islamic education.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 (free) | Limited resources, outdated curricula |\n| Private Primary | $1,000-$3,000 | Better facilities, more qualified teachers |\n| Public Secondary | $0 (free) | Limited resources, outdated curricula |\n| Private Secondary | $2,000-$5,000 | Better facilities, more qualified teachers |\n| International School | $5,000-$10,000 | Offers **British**, **American**, and **International Baccalaureate** curricula |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $500-$1,000 | $1,000-$2,000 | Limited resources, outdated curricula |\n| Private University | $2,000-$5,000 | $3,000-$6,000 | Better facilities, more qualified teachers |\n| Top-Ranked University | $3,000-$6,000 | $5,000-$10,000 | **University of Baghdad**, **University of Kurdistan** |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $50-$100 | Limited availability, especially outside major cities |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $10-$20 | Common practice, especially for **English** and **math** |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $50-$100 | **Arabic**, **English**, and **Kurdish** courses available |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $20-$50 | Basic supplies, such as notebooks and pens |\n| School Uniform | $20-$50 | Required for most schools, especially private and international |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The **University of Baghdad** and **University of Kurdistan** are considered to be among the best universities in Iraq, with a strong reputation for academic excellence.\n- **Scholarships** are available for students, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, to pursue higher education.\n- **Online learning** options are becoming increasingly popular in Iraq, especially for **English** language courses and **IT** training.\n- Education quality in Iraq is generally considered to be lower compared to other countries in the region, due to limited resources and outdated curricula.\n- **Expats** often opt for international schools, which offer a higher quality of education and a more **Western-style** curriculum.\n- **Language skills** are highly valued in Iraq, with **Arabic**, **English**, and **Kurdish** being the most commonly spoken languages.",
