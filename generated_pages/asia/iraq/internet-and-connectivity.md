[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in Iraq has undergone significant improvements in recent years, with the average internet speed increasing to 5 Mbps download. However, the quality of the internet can vary greatly depending on the location, with urban areas tend to have better connectivity than rural areas. In major cities like Baghdad and Basra, the internet is generally reliable, but in rural areas, the connection can be slow and unreliable. The internet infrastructure in Iraq is still developing, and the country faces challenges such as limited bandwidth and frequent power outages, which can affect the reliability of the internet.

Despite these challenges, the Iraqi government has been working to improve the country's internet infrastructure, with investments in fiber-optic cables and mobile networks. As a result, the internet has become more accessible and affordable for many Iraqis, with a growing number of people using the internet for communication, education, and entertainment. However, the internet in Iraq is still subject to censorship and restrictions, with some websites and social media platforms blocked by the government.
