  "content": "Iraq is generally cheaper than Turkey, with an approximate overall cost of living difference of 20-30% in favor of Iraq. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nIraq GDP per Capita (PPP): $6,449\nTurkey GDP per Capita (PPP): $28,429\nIraq Inflation Rate: 2.5%\nTurkey Inflation Rate: 11.2%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Iraq\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Iraq vs Turkey [/SECTION]\nThe cost of living in Iraq and Turkey varies significantly due to differences in economic context, lifestyle, and purchasing power. Iraq has a lower GDP per capita and inflation rate compared to Turkey, which contributes to its lower cost of living. In general, Iraq offers a more affordable lifestyle, with lower prices for housing, food, and transportation. However, Turkey provides a more developed infrastructure, better healthcare, and a wider range of amenities, which may justify its higher costs for some expats and travelers.\n\nThe economic context of both countries also plays a crucial role in determining the cost of living. Iraq's economy is largely driven by oil exports, while Turkey has a more diversified economy with a strong focus on manufacturing, tourism, and services. This diversity contributes to Turkey's higher costs, but also provides a more stable and predictable environment for businesses and individuals. In contrast, Iraq's economy is more vulnerable to fluctuations in global oil prices, which can impact the cost of living and overall stability.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Iraq (USD) | Turkey (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | $150 | $250 | 40% cheaper in Iraq |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | $100 | $180 | 44% cheaper in Iraq |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | $300 | $500 | 40% cheaper in Iraq |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Iraq (USD) | Turkey (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | $5 | $10 | 50% cheaper in Iraq |\n| Groceries (monthly) | $100 | $150 | 33% cheaper in Iraq |\n| Beer (500ml) | $2 | $3 | 33% cheaper in Iraq |\n| Coffee | $1 | $2 | 50% cheaper in Iraq |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Iraq (USD) | Turkey (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | $10 | $25 | 60% cheaper in Iraq |\n| Taxi (per km) | $0.50 | $1 | 50% cheaper in Iraq |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $0.50 | $1.20 | 58% cheaper in Iraq |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Iraq (USD) | Turkey (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | $50 | $80 | 37% cheaper in Iraq |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | $20 | $30 | 33% cheaper in Iraq |\n| Mobile Plan | $10 | $20 | 50% cheaper in Iraq |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Iraq (USD) | Turkey (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | $400 | $600 | 33% savings in Iraq |\n| Mid-Range | $800 | $1,200 | 33% savings in Iraq |\n| Comfortable | $1,500 | $2,500 | 40% savings in Iraq |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Iraq is cheaper for:**\n- Housing, with apartments ranging from 40-44% cheaper than in Turkey\n- Food, with meals and groceries costing 33-50% less than in Turkey\n- Transportation, with taxis, fuel, and transit passes costing 50-60% less than in Turkey\n- **Turkey is cheaper for:**\n- Certain luxury goods, such as high-end electronics and clothing, which may be 10-20% cheaper than in Iraq\n- Tourist attractions and activities, which can be more affordable and accessible in Turkey\n- Healthcare, with better-equipped hospitals and more qualified medical staff available in Turkey\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nFor expats, students, and retirees, Iraq may offer a more affordable lifestyle, with significant savings on housing, food, and transportation. However, Turkey provides a more developed infrastructure, better healthcare, and a wider range of amenities, which may be worth the extra cost for some individuals. Families may also prefer Turkey for its more stable and predictable environment, as well as its better schools and educational opportunities. Ultimately, the choice between Iraq and Turkey depends on individual priorities and lifestyle preferences. While Iraq is generally cheaper, Turkey offers a more comprehensive and comfortable living experience, making it a better value for those who can afford it.",
