[SECTION] How Expensive Is Iraq? [/SECTION]
Iraq is considered an affordable country to visit or live in, with a cost of living that is lower than many of its neighbors in the Middle East. The country's economy has been affected by years of conflict and instability, which has kept prices relatively low. However, prices can vary depending on the location, with cities like Baghdad and Erbil tend to be more expensive than smaller towns and rural areas. Overall, Iraq offers a great value for travelers and expats who are looking for an affordable destination with a rich history and culture.

Compared to its neighbors, Iraq is generally cheaper than countries like Turkey and Jordan, but more expensive than Iran. The cost of living in Iraq is also affected by the security situation, with some areas being more expensive due to the need for additional security measures. Despite these challenges, Iraq remains a great destination for budget-conscious travelers and expats who are looking for an affordable and unique experience.
