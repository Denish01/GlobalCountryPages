  "content": "The infrastructure in Iraq is still recovering from decades of war and sanctions, with significant investments being made in recent years to improve the country's roads, power generation, and telecommunications. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 99% of population\nInternet Penetration: 49%\nRoad Network: 45,000 km, moderate quality with some paved highways and many unpaved rural roads\nRail Network: 2,272 km\nMajor Airports: 15\nMajor Ports: 2, including the port of Umm Qasr and the port of Basra\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nIraq's infrastructure has been severely impacted by years of conflict, sanctions, and neglect, resulting in a significant gap between urban and rural areas. While major cities like Baghdad and Basra have seen significant investments in recent years, rural areas still lack access to basic services like electricity, clean water, and sanitation. The government has been working to address these issues, with a focus on rebuilding and expanding the country's infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and public buildings. Recent investments have also been made in the energy sector, with a focus on increasing power generation and reducing reliance on imports.\n\nDespite these efforts, Iraq's infrastructure still faces significant challenges, including a lack of maintenance and investment in existing facilities. The country's infrastructure is also vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, including increased temperatures and changing precipitation patterns. To address these challenges, the government has been working to develop a comprehensive infrastructure plan, which includes investments in renewable energy, water conservation, and green infrastructure.\n\nThe urban-rural gap in Iraq's infrastructure is a significant challenge, with many rural areas lacking access to basic services like electricity, clean water, and sanitation. The government has been working to address this issue, with a focus on expanding access to these services in rural areas. However, more work is needed to address the significant infrastructure gap between urban and rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 45,000 km | Moderate | Many rural roads are unpaved and in poor condition |\n| Railways | 2,272 km | Poor | Limited passenger and freight services, with plans for expansion |\n| Airports | 15 international, 10 domestic | Good | Major airports include Baghdad International and Basra International |\n| Ports | 2 major | Moderate | The port of Umm Qasr and the port of Basra are the country's main ports, with plans for expansion |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- Iraq's power generation is primarily based on **oil** and **natural gas**, with a growing focus on **renewable energy** sources like solar and wind.\n- The country's power grid is still recovering from years of war and sanctions, with frequent **outages** and **power shortages** common in many areas.\n- The government has been working to increase power generation, with a focus on reducing reliance on imports and increasing the use of renewable energy sources.\n- Iraq has set a goal of generating 10% of its electricity from **renewable energy** sources by 2025, with a focus on solar and wind power.\n- The country's **energy sector** is also being supported by international donors, including the World Bank and the European Union.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- Access to **clean water** is a significant challenge in Iraq, particularly in rural areas where many communities lack access to safe drinking water.\n- The country's **sanitation** system is also in need of significant investment, with many communities lacking access to basic sanitation facilities.\n- The government has been working to improve access to clean water and sanitation, with a focus on expanding access to these services in rural areas.\n- **Water conservation** is also a growing concern in Iraq, with the country facing significant water scarcity challenges due to climate change and population growth.\n- The government has been working to develop a comprehensive **water management** plan, which includes investments in water conservation, wastewater treatment, and water efficiency.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is widespread in Iraq, with most major cities and towns having access to 3G and 4G networks.\n- **Fiber-optic** internet is also available in many areas, although it is still limited in rural areas.\n- The government has been working to expand access to **broadband** internet, with a focus on increasing access to online services and promoting economic development.\n- **Postal services** are also available in Iraq, although they are limited in many areas due to security concerns.\n- The country's **telecommunications sector** is also being supported by international donors, including the World Bank and the European Union.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The government has launched a number of major **infrastructure projects**, including the construction of new roads, bridges, and public buildings.\n- The **Basra Water Supply Project** is a major initiative aimed at improving access to clean water in the city of Basra.\n- The **Iraq Electricity Reconstruction Project** is a major initiative aimed at rebuilding and expanding the country's power grid.\n- The **Iraq Transport Corridor Project** is a major initiative aimed at improving the country's transport infrastructure, including roads, railways, and ports.\n- The government has also launched a number of **renewable energy** projects, including solar and wind power initiatives aimed at increasing the use of renewable energy sources.",
