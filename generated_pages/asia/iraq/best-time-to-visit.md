[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Iraq has a **desert climate** with very hot summers and mild winters. The country can be divided into two main climate zones: the **desert region** in the west and south, and the **temperate region** in the north and east. The desert region is characterized by very little rainfall throughout the year, while the temperate region receives most of its rainfall during the winter months. The best time to visit Iraq is during the **dry season**, which runs from October to April, with mild temperatures and minimal rainfall. During the **wet season**, which runs from May to September, the temperatures are extremely high, and the humidity is unbearable, making it difficult to travel.

The seasons in Iraq have a significant impact on travel, with the summer months being the most challenging due to the extreme heat. The temperatures can reach as high as 120°F (49°C) in July and August, making it essential to stay hydrated and take necessary precautions. In contrast, the winter months are mild and pleasant, with temperatures ranging from 40°F (4°C) to 60°F (15°C), making it ideal for sightseeing and outdoor activities.

The **Kurdish region** in the north is generally cooler than the rest of the country, with temperatures ranging from 30°F (-1°C) to 70°F (21°C) during the winter months. The region is also home to several **mountain ranges**, including the Zagros Mountains, which offer a unique opportunity for hiking and trekking during the spring and autumn months.
