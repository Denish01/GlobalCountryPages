  "content": "The primary languages spoken in Iraq are **Arabic** and **Kurdish**, with Arabic being the most widely spoken language and the official language of the country.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nOfficial Language(s): Arabic, Kurdish\nWidely Spoken: English, Turkish\nEnglish Proficiency: Low\nScript: Arabic\nLanguage Family: Semitic, Indo-European\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]\nThe linguistic landscape of Iraq is diverse, with **Arabic** being the dominant language spoken by the majority of the population. **Kurdish** is also an official language and is widely spoken in the northern regions of the country, particularly in the Kurdistan Region. There are also several regional dialects, including Mesopotamian Arabic and Iraqi Turkmen, which are spoken by minority groups. English is not widely spoken, particularly outside of major cities like Baghdad and Erbil, and proficiency levels are generally low. However, many Iraqis in the tourism and hospitality industries have some knowledge of English, which can be helpful for visitors.\n\nIn addition to Arabic and Kurdish, there are several minority languages spoken in Iraq, including Turkish, Assyrian, and Armenian. These languages are spoken by smaller communities, often in specific regions or cities. For example, the Turkish language is spoken by the Turkmen community, which is primarily found in the cities of Kirkuk and Mosul. The Assyrian language is spoken by the Assyrian Christian community, which is mainly found in the northern regions of the country.\n\nThe use of English in Iraq is limited, but it is becoming more widely used, particularly among the younger population and in business and education. Many universities and schools teach English as a second language, and it is becoming more common to see English language signs and advertisements in major cities. However, it is still important for visitors to learn some basic Arabic phrases to communicate with locals and show respect for the culture.\n\n[SECTION] Essential Phrases [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| English | Local Language | Pronunciation | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hello | Marhaba | MAR-hah-bah | formal |\n| Hello | As-salamu alaykum | ah-sah-LAH-moo ah-LAY-koom | formal, response: Wa alaykum as-salam |\n| Thank you | Shukraan | SHOO-krah-n | formal |\n| Please | Min fadlak | min fad-DAK | formal |\n| Yes / No | Na'am / Laa | NAH-am / LAH | formal |\n| Excuse me | Afwan | ahf-WAHN | formal |\n| How much? | Kam? | KAHM | formal |\n| Where is...? | Ayn...? | AYN... | formal |\n| I don't understand | La afham | LAH ahf-HAHM | formal |\n| Do you speak English? | Hal tatakallam al-ingiliziyya? | hahl tah-tah-KAH-lam ah-leen-gee-LEE-zah | formal |\n| Help! | Musa'ada | moo-SAH-dah | formal |\n| Goodbye | Ma'a as-salaama | MAH ah sah-LAH-mah | formal |\n| Sorry | Aasif | AH-seef | formal |\n| Welcome | Ahlan wa sahlan | ah-LAHN wah SAH-lahn | formal |\n| How are you? | Kayf al-haal? | KAYF ah-hahl | formal |\n| What's your name? | Ma ismuk? | MAH ees-MUK | formal |\n| My name is... | Ismi... | ees-MEE... | formal |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Numbers & Bargaining [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Number | Local Word | Pronunciation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Wahid | WAH-heed |\n| 2 | Ithnayn | ith-NAYN |\n| 3 | Thalatha | thah-LAH-thah |\n| 4 | Arba'a | ar-BAH-ah |\n| 5 | Khamsa | KHAM-sah |\n| 6 | Sitta | SEE-tah |\n| 7 | Sab'a | SAH-bah |\n| 8 | Thamaanya | thah-MAH-nah |\n| 9 | Tis'a | tee-SAH |\n| 10 | Ashara | ah-SHA-rah |\n| 100 | Mi'a | MEE-ah |\n| 1000 | Alf | ALF |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Communication Tips [/SECTION]\n- When interacting with locals, it's essential to be respectful and polite, using formal language and titles such as \"Mr.\" or \"Mrs.\"\n- Avoid using gestures with the left hand, as it is considered impolite in Iraqi culture\n- Direct eye contact is important in Iraqi culture, but it's also important to be respectful and avoid staring\n- When bargaining, it's essential to be patient and respectful, and to avoid getting angry or aggressive\n- Learning a few basic Arabic phrases can go a long way in showing respect for the culture and people\n- When communicating with locals, it's essential to be clear and concise, avoiding confusing or complicated language\n- Avoid discussing sensitive topics such as politics or religion, as they can be controversial and divisive\n- When interacting with women, it's essential to be respectful and modest, avoiding physical contact or flirting\n\n[SECTION] Translation Tools & Resources [/SECTION]\n- Google Translate is a useful app for translating Arabic and Kurdish phrases\n- Lonely Planet's Iraqi Arabic phrasebook is a helpful resource for learning basic phrases and vocabulary\n- Duolingo is a popular language learning app that offers courses in Arabic and Kurdish\n- The Iraqi government's tourism website offers a range of language resources and translation tools for visitors\n- Hiring a local guide or translator can be a helpful way to navigate the country and communicate with locals, especially for those who don't speak Arabic or Kurdish.",
