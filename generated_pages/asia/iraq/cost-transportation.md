[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Iraq has a relatively underdeveloped public transportation system, with most people relying on private vehicles or taxis to get around. The quality of public transit varies significantly between cities, with Baghdad having the most comprehensive network of buses and minivans. However, the lack of a well-organized and efficient public transportation system makes it challenging for visitors to navigate the country. In major cities like Baghdad and Basra, traffic congestion is a significant issue, and roads are often in poor condition.

The most common modes of transportation in Iraq are taxis, minivans, and private cars. Many Iraqis own private vehicles, and the country has a high rate of car ownership. However, the lack of a reliable public transportation system makes it difficult for those who cannot afford private vehicles to get around. In recent years, ride-hailing apps like Uber and Careem have become popular in major cities, providing an alternative to traditional taxis. Despite the challenges, the Iraqi government has been working to improve the transportation infrastructure, including the development of new roads and highways.
