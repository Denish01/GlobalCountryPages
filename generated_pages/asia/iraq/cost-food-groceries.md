[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Iraq's food prices are influenced by various factors, including the country's reliance on imports, transportation costs, and government subsidies. The **inflation rate** of -12.3% in 2024 has helped to keep prices relatively stable, making food more affordable for the average consumer. Eating out is a common practice in Iraq, with many restaurants and street food stalls offering a wide range of traditional dishes at affordable prices. However, home cooking is also prevalent, with many Iraqis preferring to prepare meals at home using fresh ingredients from local markets.

In comparison to other countries in the region, Iraq's food prices are relatively low, making it an attractive destination for travelers and expats. The country's **GDP per capita PPP** of $14,464 in 2024 indicates a relatively high standard of living, which contributes to the demand for a wide range of food products. However, the **out-of-pocket health spend** of 54.0% in 2023 suggests that many Iraqis may have limited disposable income, making affordable food options a priority.

[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]
The prices of food items can vary significantly between supermarkets and local markets in Iraq. Supermarkets tend to offer a wider range of products, including imported goods, but at higher prices. Local markets, on the other hand, offer fresh produce and traditional products at lower prices. For example, a kilogram of apples may cost $1.50 at a supermarket, but only $1.00 at a local market. When shopping at local markets, it's common to **bargain** with vendors to get the best price.

In general, it's recommended to buy fresh produce, such as fruits and vegetables, at local markets, while supermarkets may be a better option for packaged goods and imported products. Some popular local markets in Iraq include the **Shorja Market** in Baghdad and the **Khan al-Naqib** market in Mosul. When shopping at these markets, be prepared to **haggle** over prices and expect to pay in cash.
