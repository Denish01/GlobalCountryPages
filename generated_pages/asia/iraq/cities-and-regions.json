These governorates are further divided into districts, and then into sub-districts. The governorates have a significant degree of autonomy, with their own local governments and administrative bodies. The country's administrative structure is a result of its complex history, with different regions having distinct cultural, linguistic, and economic characteristics.\n\nThe division of Iraq into governorates has helped to promote regional development and address the unique needs of each area. However, it has also led to some challenges, such as disparities in economic development and access to basic services. Despite these challenges, the governorate system has played an important role in promoting stability and security in the country, particularly in the aftermath of the 2003 invasion and the subsequent period of conflict.\n\n[SECTION] Major Cities [/SECTION]\n**Baghdad** (8.1M)\nRole: capital, economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: its rich history, cultural landmarks, and bustling markets\nBest For: history buffs, cultural enthusiasts, and business travelers\n\n**Basra** (2.5M)\nRole: port city, economic hub\nKnown For: its strategic location on the Persian Gulf, oil reserves, and historic significance\nBest For: business travelers, oil and gas industry professionals, and those interested in history and trade\n\n**Mosul** (1.4M)\nRole: cultural center, historic city\nKnown For: its ancient history, cultural landmarks, and stunning architecture\nBest For: history enthusiasts, cultural tourists, and those interested in exploring the country's diverse heritage\n\n**Erbil** (1.1M)\nRole: capital of the Kurdistan Region, economic hub\nKnown For: its modern infrastructure, business opportunities, and cultural attractions\nBest For: business travelers, investors, and those interested in exploring the Kurdistan Region\n\n**Najaf** (1M)\nRole: religious center, cultural hub\nKnown For: its historic significance, religious landmarks, and vibrant cultural scene\nBest For: pilgrims, religious tourists, and those interested in exploring the country's spiritual heritage\n\n**Kirkuk** (0.9M)\nRole: oil city, economic hub\nKnown For: its oil reserves, cultural diversity, and historic significance\nBest For: oil and gas industry professionals, business travelers, and those interested in exploring the country's energy sector\n\n**Sulaymaniyah** (0.8M)\nRole: cultural center, economic hub\nKnown For: its stunning natural beauty, cultural attractions, and business opportunities\nBest For: nature lovers, cultural tourists, and business travelers\n\n**Hillah** (0.7M)\nRole: historic city, cultural center\nKnown For: its ancient history, cultural landmarks, and vibrant cultural scene\nBest For: history enthusiasts, cultural tourists, and those interested in exploring the country's diverse heritage\n\n[SECTION] Key Regions [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Region | Character | Known For | Major City |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Kurdistan Region | mountainous, culturally diverse | natural beauty, oil reserves, cultural attractions | Erbil |\n| Basra Governorate | coastal, oil-rich | port city, oil reserves, historic significance | Basra |\n| Baghdad Governorate | urban, culturally diverse | historic landmarks, cultural attractions, business opportunities | Baghdad |\n| Najaf Governorate | desert, religiously significant | historic landmarks, religious sites, cultural attractions | Najaf |\n| Nineveh Governorate | historic, culturally diverse | ancient ruins, cultural landmarks, natural beauty | Mosul |\n| Diyala Governorate | agricultural, culturally diverse | natural beauty, historic landmarks, cultural attractions | Baqubah |\n| Karbala Governorate | desert, religiously significant | historic landmarks, religious sites, cultural attractions | Karbala |\n| Maysan Governorate | rural, oil-rich | natural beauty, oil reserves, cultural attractions | Amarah |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Differences [/SECTION]\n- The Kurdistan Region in the north is known for its mountainous terrain, culturally diverse population, and oil reserves, with a distinct Kurdish culture and language.\n- The southern governorates, such as Basra and Maysan, are characterized by their coastal location, oil-rich economy, and historic significance, with a strong Arab culture and dialect.\n- The central governorates, including Baghdad and Najaf, are urbanized, culturally diverse, and economically significant, with a mix of Arab and Kurdish cultures.\n- The western governorates, such as Anbar and Salah ad Din, are largely desert, with a strong tribal culture and a history of conflict.\n\n[SECTION] Getting Around [/SECTION]\nIraq has a relatively underdeveloped transportation network, with limited domestic flights, trains, and buses. The country's road network is extensive, but driving conditions can be challenging due to security concerns, traffic congestion, and poor road maintenance. However, there are efforts to improve the transportation infrastructure, including the expansion of airports and the development of new rail lines. For travelers, the best option is often to hire a private car and driver or to use taxi services, which are widely available in major cities.\n\nDomestic flights are available between major cities, such as Baghdad, Basra, and Erbil, but the frequency and reliability of these flights can vary. Trains are also available, but the network is limited, and the service can be slow and unreliable. Buses are a more affordable option, but they can be crowded and uncomfortable. Despite these challenges, getting around Iraq can be a rewarding experience, with many opportunities to explore the country's diverse culture, history, and natural beauty. [CALLOUT] It is essential to exercise caution when traveling in Iraq, particularly in areas with high security risks, and to follow local advice and guidance.",
