  "content": "Healthcare in Iraq is a mixed system that faces significant challenges, including a shortage of medical professionals, inadequate infrastructure, and limited access to quality care, particularly in rural areas.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nQuality Rating: 2/5\nEmergency Number: 112\nHospital Standard: Basic\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: moderate\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nIraq's healthcare system is a mix of public and private providers, with the public sector being the primary source of healthcare for the majority of the population. The public healthcare system is overseen by the Ministry of Health, which operates a network of hospitals, clinics, and health centers throughout the country. However, the public sector faces significant challenges, including a shortage of medical professionals, inadequate infrastructure, and limited access to quality care, particularly in rural areas. In contrast, the private sector offers higher-quality care, but it is often expensive and inaccessible to many Iraqis. The quality of care varies significantly depending on the location, with urban areas generally having better access to quality healthcare than rural areas.\n\nThe healthcare system in Iraq is also facing significant challenges due to the country's security situation, which has led to a brain drain of medical professionals and a shortage of essential medical supplies. Additionally, the system is often plagued by corruption, which can limit access to quality care, particularly for those who cannot afford to pay bribes. Despite these challenges, the Iraqi government has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, including investing in new infrastructure and equipment, and increasing the number of medical professionals.\n\nOverall, while Iraq's healthcare system has the potential to provide quality care, it is often hindered by significant challenges, including a shortage of medical professionals, inadequate infrastructure, and limited access to quality care, particularly in rural areas. As a result, many Iraqis, particularly those in rural areas, often rely on traditional medicine or travel to other countries for medical care.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Baghdad Medical City | Baghdad | Public | General medicine, surgery, pediatrics | Limited |\n| Ibn Al-Khatib Hospital | Baghdad | Public | General medicine, surgery, emergency medicine | Limited |\n| Al-Kindy Hospital | Baghdad | Private | Cardiology, oncology, neurology | Yes |\n| Royal Hospital | Erbil | Private | General medicine, surgery, pediatrics | Yes |\n| Erbil Hospital | Erbil | Public | General medicine, surgery, emergency medicine | Limited |\n| Kurdish Health Center | Sulaymaniyah | Private | General medicine, surgery, pediatrics | Yes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Private health insurance** is recommended for expats and those who can afford it, as it provides access to higher-quality care and can help cover the cost of medical treatment.\n- **Local insurance options** are available, but they may not provide the same level of coverage as international insurance plans.\n- **Expats** are often required to have health insurance as a condition of their employment or residency.\n- The **cost of health insurance** in Iraq can vary significantly depending on the provider, level of coverage, and individual circumstances.\n- **Government-sponsored insurance** is available for Iraqi citizens, but it may not provide the same level of coverage as private insurance plans.\n- **Supplemental insurance** may be necessary to cover the cost of specialized medical treatment or care in other countries.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Medications** are widely available in urban areas, but may be limited in rural areas.\n- **Prescription requirements** vary depending on the medication and the pharmacy, but many medications are available over-the-counter.\n- **Common brands** of medications are often available, but may be more expensive than local alternatives.\n- **Costs** of medications can vary significantly depending on the pharmacy and the medication.\n- **Pharmacy access** is generally moderate, with many pharmacies available in urban areas, but limited in rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Hepatitis A** and **typhoid** vaccinations are recommended for all travelers to Iraq.\n- **Hepatitis B** and **rabies** vaccinations are recommended for travelers who will be spending time in rural areas or working with animals.\n- **Malaria** is present in some areas of Iraq, particularly in the southern regions.\n- **Water safety** is a concern in Iraq, and travelers should avoid drinking tap water and use bottled or filtered water instead.\n- **Food safety** is also a concern, and travelers should avoid eating undercooked meat or raw vegetables.\n- **Dengue fever** and **cholera** are also present in Iraq, and travelers should take precautions to avoid these diseases.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **Medical tourism** is not a significant industry in Iraq, due to the country's security situation and limited medical infrastructure.\n- However, some **private hospitals** in Iraq, such as the Al-Kindy Hospital in Baghdad, offer high-quality medical care and may be an option for medical tourists.\n- **Cost savings** may be available for certain medical procedures, but travelers should carefully research the quality of care and the qualifications of medical professionals before seeking treatment in Iraq.\n- **Accredited hospitals** are limited in Iraq, and travelers should research the hospital's reputation and accreditation before seeking treatment.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- In the event of an **emergency**, travelers should call the emergency number, 112, or seek immediate medical attention at the nearest hospital.\n- **Ambulance reliability** is limited in Iraq, and travelers may need to rely on private transportation to get to a hospital.\n- **Nearest hospitals** may not always have English-speaking staff, and travelers may need to bring a translator or seek assistance from a local guide.\n- **Insurance claims** may be difficult to process in Iraq, and travelers should carefully research their insurance provider's policies and procedures before seeking medical treatment.\n- **Medical evacuation** may be necessary in serious cases, and travelers should research their insurance provider's policies on medical evacuation before traveling to Iraq.",
