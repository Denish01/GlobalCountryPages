[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]
The linguistic landscape of Iraq is diverse, with **Arabic** being the dominant language spoken by the majority of the population. **Kurdish** is also an official language and is widely spoken in the northern regions of the country, particularly in the Kurdistan Region. There are also several regional dialects, including Mesopotamian Arabic and Iraqi Turkmen, which are spoken by minority groups. English is not widely spoken, particularly outside of major cities like Baghdad and Erbil, and proficiency levels are generally low. However, many Iraqis in the tourism and hospitality industries have some knowledge of English, which can be helpful for visitors.

In addition to Arabic and Kurdish, there are several minority languages spoken in Iraq, including Turkish, Assyrian, and Armenian. These languages are spoken by smaller communities, often in specific regions or cities. For example, the Turkish language is spoken by the Turkmen community, which is primarily found in the cities of Kirkuk and Mosul. The Assyrian language is spoken by the Assyrian Christian community, which is mainly found in the northern regions of the country.

The use of English in Iraq is limited, but it is becoming more widely used, particularly among the younger population and in business and education. Many universities and schools teach English as a second language, and it is becoming more common to see English language signs and advertisements in major cities. However, it is still important for visitors to learn some basic Arabic phrases to communicate with locals and show respect for the culture.
