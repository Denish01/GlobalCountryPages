However, the quality of the internet can vary greatly depending on the location, with urban areas tend to have better connectivity than rural areas. In major cities like Baghdad and Basra, the internet is generally reliable, but in rural areas, the connection can be slow and unreliable. The internet infrastructure in Iraq is still developing, and the country faces challenges such as limited bandwidth and frequent power outages, which can affect the reliability of the internet.\n\nDespite these challenges, the Iraqi government has been working to improve the country's internet infrastructure, with investments in fiber-optic cables and mobile networks. As a result, the internet has become more accessible and affordable for many Iraqis, with a growing number of people using the internet for communication, education, and entertainment. However, the internet in Iraq is still subject to censorship and restrictions, with some websites and social media platforms blocked by the government.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nGetting a SIM card in Iraq is relatively easy, with several mobile providers offering tourist-friendly plans. The main carriers in Iraq are Zain Iraq, Asiacell, and Korek Telecom, which offer a range of prepaid and postpaid plans. To buy a SIM card, you will need to provide your passport and a copy of your visa, as well as fill out a registration form. You can buy SIM cards at mobile provider stores, airports, and some supermarkets.\n\nThe cost of a SIM card can vary depending on the provider and the plan you choose, but you can expect to pay around 10 USD for a tourist SIM. Data plans are also available, with prices starting from around 5 USD per month for 1 GB of data. It's recommended to check with the provider for the latest plans and prices, as they can change frequently.\n\n[TABLE]\n| Carrier | Tourist Plan | Data | Price (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Zain Iraq | Tourist Plan | 1 GB | 5 | Valid for 30 days |\n| Asiacell | Prepaid Plan | 2 GB | 10 | Valid for 30 days |\n| Korek Telecom | Data Plan | 5 GB | 20 | Valid for 30 days |\n| Iraqna | Prepaid Plan | 1 GB | 5 | Valid for 30 days |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] WiFi Availability [/SECTION]\n- Hotel WiFi is generally available in major cities, but the quality can vary depending on the hotel and location.\n- Cafe WiFi is not as common as in other countries, but some cafes in major cities may offer WiFi.\n- Coworking spaces are becoming more popular in Iraq, especially in Baghdad, and often offer reliable WiFi.\n- Public WiFi is limited, but some cities may offer free WiFi in public areas such as parks and squares.\n- Some restaurants and shops may also offer WiFi, but it's not always reliable or secure.\n\n[SECTION] For Remote Workers [/SECTION]\n- Coworking spaces such as The Station and Baghdad Coworking Space offer reliable WiFi and a productive environment.\n- Cafe chains such as Costa Coffee and Starbucks may offer reliable WiFi, but it's not always available.\n- Backup internet options such as mobile hotspots or satellite internet may be necessary in areas with limited connectivity.\n- Using a **VPN** is recommended to ensure secure and private internet access.\n- Some hotels and accommodations may offer **co-working spaces** or **business centers** with reliable WiFi and other amenities.\n\n[SECTION] Tips & Warnings [/SECTION]\n- Internet censorship is a significant issue in Iraq, with some websites and social media platforms blocked by the government.\n- Using a **VPN** can help bypass censorship and ensure secure internet access.\n- Some websites and online services may be blocked due to **geographic restrictions**, so it's essential to check with the provider before accessing them.\n- Roaming charges can be high, so it's recommended to buy a local SIM card or use a roaming alternative such as a **global SIM**.\n- eSIM options are not widely available in Iraq, so it's essential to check with your provider before traveling.\n- Be cautious when using public WiFi, as it may not be secure, and avoid accessing sensitive information or making online transactions.",
