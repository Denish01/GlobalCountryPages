The population growth rate is approximately 2.3%, which is higher than the global average. This growth is largely driven by a high fertility rate, with an average of 3.6 children per woman. The population is also relatively young, with a median age of 21 years. Urbanization is a significant trend in Iraq, with around 70% of the population living in urban areas. The capital city, Baghdad, is the largest urban center, with a population of over 7 million people.\n\nThe population of Iraq has been affected by various factors, including conflict, displacement, and migration. Many Iraqis have fled the country due to violence and instability, with significant numbers seeking refuge in neighboring countries such as Jordan and Turkey. However, in recent years, there has been a trend of return migration, with many Iraqis returning to their homeland. The government has also implemented policies to encourage urbanization and economic development, which has led to an increase in population growth in urban areas.\n\nDespite these trends, Iraq still faces significant challenges related to population growth and development. The country's infrastructure and public services are often overwhelmed by the growing population, leading to issues such as poverty, unemployment, and lack of access to basic services like healthcare and education. The government has recognized these challenges and is working to address them through various initiatives and development programs.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Arabs | 75-80% | Throughout the country | Dominant ethnic group |\n| Kurds | 15-20% | Northern regions, including Kurdistan | Autonomous region |\n| Turkmen | 2-5% | Northern regions, including Kirkuk | Recognized minority group |\n| Assyrians | 1-2% | Northern regions, including Nineveh | Christian minority group |\n| Yazidis | 1% | Northern regions, including Sinjar | Minority group with unique culture and traditions |\n| Shabaks | 0.5-1% | Northern regions, including Nineveh | Shia Muslim minority group |\n| Armenians | 0.1-0.5% | Urban areas, including Baghdad | Christian minority group |\n[/TABLE]\nIraq is a multicultural and multi-ethnic society, with a diverse range of ethnic groups.
