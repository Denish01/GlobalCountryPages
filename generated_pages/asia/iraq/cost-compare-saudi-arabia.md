[SECTION] Overview: Iraq vs Saudi Arabia [/SECTION]
Iraq and Saudi Arabia are two neighboring countries in the Middle East with distinct economic contexts. Iraq's economy has been heavily reliant on oil exports, while Saudi Arabia has been diversifying its economy in recent years. In terms of cost of living, Iraq is generally cheaper than Saudi Arabia, with lower prices for accommodation, food, and transportation. The cost of living in Iraq is approximately 30-40% lower than in Saudi Arabia, making it an attractive option for those looking for a more affordable lifestyle. However, it's essential to note that the cost of living in Iraq can vary significantly depending on the location, with cities like Baghdad and Basra tend to be more expensive than smaller towns and rural areas.

The economic context of both countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Iraq's economy has been affected by years of conflict and instability, which has led to a decline in the value of the Iraqi dinar (IQD) and higher inflation rates. In contrast, Saudi Arabia's economy has been more stable, with a stronger currency and lower inflation rates. However, the cost of living in Saudi Arabia is still relatively high, especially in cities like Riyadh and Jeddah, where the demand for housing and other services is high. Overall, while both countries have their unique challenges and opportunities, Iraq is generally the more affordable option for those looking to live and work in the region.
