The market is primarily driven by demand for residential properties, with many Iraqis seeking to own their own homes. However, the market is still in its early stages, and prices can vary significantly depending on the location, with urban areas like Baghdad and Basra tend to be more expensive than rural areas. The price trajectory has been generally upward, with a significant increase in prices in recent years, but the market is still considered to be relatively affordable compared to other countries in the region.\n\nThe urban-rural divide is also a significant factor in the Iraqi property market, with many rural areas lacking basic amenities and infrastructure. However, the government has been investing in rural development projects, which is expected to drive growth in these areas. The market is also heavily influenced by the country's security situation, with areas that are considered to be more secure tend to be more popular with investors. Despite the challenges, many investors are attracted to the Iraqi market due to its potential for high returns, particularly in the residential sector.\n\nThe Iraqi government has introduced several initiatives to encourage foreign investment in the property sector, including the establishment of free zones and investment commissions. These initiatives have helped to attract investors from countries such as Turkey, Iran, and the UAE. However, the market is still subject to various risks, including political instability and security concerns, which can make it challenging for investors to navigate.\n\n[SECTION] Prices by Area [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area/City | Buy (per sqm, USD) | Rent (monthly, USD) | Type |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Baghdad | 1,200 | 150 | Apartment |\n| Basra | 1,000 | 100 | Villa |\n| Erbil | 1,500 | 200 | Apartment |\n| Mosul | 800 | 80 | House |\n| Najaf | 900 | 90 | Villa |\n| Karbala | 1,000 | 100 | Apartment |\n| Sulaymaniyah | 1,200 | 120 | House |\n| Kirkuk | 800 | 80 | Villa |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Ownership Rules [/SECTION]\n- Foreigners are allowed to buy property in Iraq, but they must obtain a permit from the Ministry of Interior, which can be a lengthy and bureaucratic process.\n- Foreign companies can own property in Iraq, but they must be registered with the Iraqi Ministry of Trade.\n- Leasehold agreements are also available for foreigners, which can provide a workaround for those who are unable to obtain a permit to buy.\n- Foreigners who marry Iraqi citizens can also own property, but they must meet certain requirements and obtain the necessary permits.\n- The Iraqi government has introduced several regulations to restrict foreign ownership in certain areas, such as near military bases or strategic locations.\n\n[SECTION] Buying Process [/SECTION]\n1.
