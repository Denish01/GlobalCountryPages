  "content": "Iraq is generally cheaper than Jordan, with an overall cost of living difference of around 20-30% in favor of Iraq.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nIraq GDP per Capita (PPP): 10,650\nJordan GDP per Capita (PPP): 14,220\nIraq Inflation Rate: 1.5%\nJordan Inflation Rate: 0.5%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Iraq\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Iraq vs Jordan [/SECTION]\nThe cost of living in Iraq and Jordan can vary significantly, with Iraq generally being the more affordable option. Iraq's economy has been growing steadily in recent years, driven by its oil exports, while Jordan's economy has been more diversified, with a strong focus on services and tourism. However, Iraq's cost of living is still lower, with prices for housing, food, and transportation being significantly cheaper than in Jordan. On average, Iraq is around 20-30% cheaper than Jordan, making it an attractive option for expats, students, and retirees looking for a more affordable lifestyle.\n\nThe economic context of both countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Iraq's economy has been impacted by years of conflict and instability, which has led to a shortage of certain goods and services, driving up prices. However, the country has been making efforts to rebuild and stabilize its economy, which has led to a decrease in prices for certain goods and services. Jordan, on the other hand, has a more stable economy, but it is also more prone to external shocks, such as changes in global oil prices, which can impact the cost of living.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Iraq (USD) | Jordan (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 200 | 350 | 43% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 150 | 250 | 40% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 400 | 600 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Iraq (USD) | Jordan (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 5 | 10 | 50% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 100 | 150 | 33% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | 2 | 5 | 60% cheaper |\n| Coffee | 1 | 2 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Iraq (USD) | Jordan (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 10 | 20 | 50% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | 0.5 | 1 | 50% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 0.5 | 1 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Iraq (USD) | Jordan (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 50 | 100 | 50% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 20 | 30 | 33% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | 10 | 20 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Iraq (USD) | Jordan (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 500 | 800 | 37% |\n| Mid-Range | 1,000 | 1,500 | 33% |\n| Comfortable | 2,000 | 3,000 | 33% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Iraq is cheaper for:**\n- Rent and housing, with prices being 30-40% lower than in Jordan\n- Food and dining, with meals and groceries being 30-50% cheaper\n- Transportation, with taxi fares and fuel prices being 50% lower\n- Utilities and internet, with prices being 30-50% cheaper\n- **Jordan is cheaper for:**\n- Certain luxury goods, such as high-end clothing and electronics\n- International travel, with Jordan's more developed airport and transportation network\n- Healthcare, with Jordan having a more developed and modern healthcare system\n- Education, with Jordan having a more developed and modern education system\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nWhen it comes to choosing between Iraq and Jordan, the decision ultimately depends on your lifestyle and priorities.
