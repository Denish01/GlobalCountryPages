[SECTION] How Iraq Is Divided [/SECTION]
Iraq is divided into 18 governorates, also known as provinces, which are the primary administrative divisions of the country. These governorates are further divided into districts, and then into sub-districts. The governorates have a significant degree of autonomy, with their own local governments and administrative bodies. The country's administrative structure is a result of its complex history, with different regions having distinct cultural, linguistic, and economic characteristics.

The division of Iraq into governorates has helped to promote regional development and address the unique needs of each area. However, it has also led to some challenges, such as disparities in economic development and access to basic services. Despite these challenges, the governorate system has played an important role in promoting stability and security in the country, particularly in the aftermath of the 2003 invasion and the subsequent period of conflict.

[SECTION] Getting Around [/SECTION]
Iraq has a relatively underdeveloped transportation network, with limited domestic flights, trains, and buses. The country's road network is extensive, but driving conditions can be challenging due to security concerns, traffic congestion, and poor road maintenance. However, there are efforts to improve the transportation infrastructure, including the expansion of airports and the development of new rail lines. For travelers, the best option is often to hire a private car and driver or to use taxi services, which are widely available in major cities.

Domestic flights are available between major cities, such as Baghdad, Basra, and Erbil, but the frequency and reliability of these flights can vary. Trains are also available, but the network is limited, and the service can be slow and unreliable. Buses are a more affordable option, but they can be crowded and uncomfortable. Despite these challenges, getting around Iraq can be a rewarding experience, with many opportunities to explore the country's diverse culture, history, and natural beauty. [CALLOUT] It is essential to exercise caution when traveling in Iraq, particularly in areas with high security risks, and to follow local advice and guidance.
