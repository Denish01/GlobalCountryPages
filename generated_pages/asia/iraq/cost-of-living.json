[/SECTION]\nIraq is considered an affordable country to visit or live in, with a cost of living that is lower than many of its neighbors in the Middle East. The country's economy has been affected by years of conflict and instability, which has kept prices relatively low. However, prices can vary depending on the location, with cities like Baghdad and Erbil tend to be more expensive than smaller towns and rural areas. Overall, Iraq offers a great value for travelers and expats who are looking for an affordable destination with a rich history and culture.\n\nCompared to its neighbors, Iraq is generally cheaper than countries like Turkey and Jordan, but more expensive than Iran. The cost of living in Iraq is also affected by the security situation, with some areas being more expensive due to the need for additional security measures. Despite these challenges, Iraq remains a great destination for budget-conscious travelers and expats who are looking for an affordable and unique experience.\n\n[SECTION] Accommodation Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Price Range (USD/night) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Hostel/Budget | $10-20 | Basic rooms with shared facilities, often in old buildings |\n| Mid-Range Hotel | $30-60 | Comfortable rooms with private bathrooms, air conditioning, and Wi-Fi |\n| Luxury/Resort | $100-200 | High-end hotels with modern amenities, pools, and restaurants |\n| Apartment Rent (monthly) | $200-500 | Furnished apartments in city centers, prices vary depending on location and amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $3-5 |\n| Casual Restaurant | $10-20 |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $20-40 |\n| Fine Dining | $50-100 |\n| Beer (local) | $5-10 |\n| Coffee | $2-5 |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $1-2 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport | Cost (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Local bus/metro ride | $0.50-1 |\n| Taxi (per km) | $1-2 |\n| Domestic flight | $100-200 |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $0.50-1 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Breakdown [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Category | Budget ($) | Mid-Range ($) | Comfortable ($) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rent | 200 | 400 | 800 |\n| Food | 200 | 400 | 600 |\n| Transport | 50 | 100 | 200 |\n| Utilities | 50 | 100 | 150 |\n| Entertainment | 100 | 200 | 300 |\n| **Total** | **600** | **1200** | **2050** |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Money-Saving Tips [/SECTION]\n- Consider staying in budget-friendly accommodations, such as hostels or guesthouses, to save on rent.\n- Eat at local eateries or street food stalls, which offer delicious and affordable meals.\n- Use public transportation, such as buses or taxis, instead of renting a car or hiring a private driver.\n- Avoid traveling during peak season, when prices for accommodations and transportation tend to be higher.\n- Learn some basic Arabic phrases, such as \"hello\" and \"thank you\", to show respect for the local culture and people.\n- Be prepared to haggle when shopping at markets or bazaars, as this is a common practice in Iraq.",
