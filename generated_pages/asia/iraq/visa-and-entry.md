# Iraq Visa & Entry Requirements

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Iraq before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Iraq has a relatively strict visa policy, with only a few countries eligible for visa-free access. Citizens of most countries require a visa to enter Iraq, and the process can be complex and time-consuming. The Iraqi government has introduced an e-visa system for some nationalities, which simplifies the application process. However, the requirements and regulations for obtaining a visa can vary significantly depending on the nationality and purpose of the visit.

The Iraqi government is working to improve the country's tourism infrastructure and attract more visitors, but the security situation and bureaucratic hurdles can still pose challenges for travelers. Currently, only a handful of countries, including some Arab nations, have visa-free access to Iraq. For most nationalities, a visa is required, and the application process involves submitting various documents and meeting specific requirements.
