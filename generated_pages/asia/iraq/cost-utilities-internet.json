However, the quality of services can still vary depending on the location, with urban areas generally having better infrastructure than rural areas. The costs of utilities in Iraq can fluctuate due to seasonal variation, with electricity and water usage increasing during the hot summer months. Additionally, the Iraqi government has implemented measures to reduce subsidies and increase efficiency in the utility sector, which may lead to changes in pricing and availability.\n\nThe overall cost of living in Iraq is relatively low compared to other countries in the region, with the GDP per capita PPP standing at $14,464 (2024) and an inflation rate of -12.3% (2024). However, the out-of-pocket health spend is relatively high at 54.0% (2023), and the health expenditure per capita is $333 (2023). The utility costs in Iraq are generally stable, but prices can vary depending on the provider and location. It is essential to research and compare prices before selecting a utility provider to ensure the best rates.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $50 | $100 | $150 | |\n| Water | $10 | $20 | $30 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $5 | $10 | $15 | (if separate) |\n| **Total** | **$85** | **$160** | **$235** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $20-30 | 10-20 Mbps | EarthLink, FastLink |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $50-70 | 50-100 Mbps | EarthLink, FastLink |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-20 | 5-10 GB | Korek, Zain |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-30 | 10-20 GB | Korek, Zain |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $50-100 | varies | EarthLink, FastLink |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (if applicable) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Iraq, it is recommended to visit the provider's office in person and bring the necessary documents, such as a passport and rental agreement.\n- Prepaid electricity meters are widely available in Iraq, and they can help consumers manage their energy usage and avoid unexpected bills.\n- The best internet providers in Iraq are EarthLink and FastLink, which offer reliable and fast connections.\n- To save on utility bills, consumers can take advantage of energy-efficient appliances and practices, such as using LED light bulbs and turning off lights and electronics when not in use.\n- It is also recommended to compare prices and plans from different providers to find the best deals and promotions.",
