The country can be divided into two main climate zones: the **desert region** in the west and south, and the **temperate region** in the north and east. The desert region is characterized by very little rainfall throughout the year, while the temperate region receives most of its rainfall during the winter months.

During the **wet season**, which runs from May to September, the temperatures are extremely high, and the humidity is unbearable, making it difficult to travel.\n\nThe seasons in Iraq have a significant impact on travel, with the summer months being the most challenging due to the extreme heat. The temperatures can reach as high as 120°F (49°C) in July and August, making it essential to stay hydrated and take necessary precautions. In contrast, the winter months are mild and pleasant, with temperatures ranging from 40°F (4°C) to 60°F (15°C), making it ideal for sightseeing and outdoor activities.\n\nThe **Kurdish region** in the north is generally cooler than the rest of the country, with temperatures ranging from 30°F (-1°C) to 70°F (21°C) during the winter months. The region is also home to several **mountain ranges**, including the Zagros Mountains, which offer a unique opportunity for hiking and trekking during the spring and autumn months.\n\n[SECTION] Month-by-Month Guide [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Month | Weather | Crowds | Prices | Best For |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| January | Cool and rainy | Low | $ | Visiting ancient ruins, exploring cities |\n| February | Mild and sunny | Low | $ | Attending festivals, visiting museums |\n| March | Pleasant and mild | Medium | $$ | Hiking, trekking, and outdoor activities |\n| April | Warm and sunny | Medium | $$ | Visiting historical sites, attending cultural events |\n| May | Hot and dry | Medium | $$ | Exploring desert landscapes, visiting oases |\n| June | Extremely hot | Low | $ | Avoiding crowds, visiting indoor attractions |\n| July | Very hot and dry | Low | $ | Staying indoors, visiting air-conditioned spaces |\n| August | Hot and humid | Low | $ | Relaxing in cool spaces, avoiding outdoor activities |\n| September | Warm and sunny | Medium | $$ | Attending festivals, visiting outdoor attractions |\n| October | Mild and pleasant | Medium | $$ | Exploring cities, visiting historical sites |\n| November | Cool and rainy | Low | $ | Visiting ancient ruins, attending cultural events |\n| December | Cool and sunny | High | $$$ | Attending festivals, visiting popular attractions |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Festivals & Events Calendar [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Event | Month(s) | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Nowruz | March | A Kurdish New Year celebration, marking the beginning of spring |\n| Eid al-Fitr | May-June | A Muslim holiday, marking the end of Ramadan |\n| Eid al-Adha | July-August | A Muslim holiday, commemorating the willingness of Ibrahim to sacrifice his son |\n| Ashura | August-September | A Shia Muslim holiday, commemorating the martyrdom of Hussein |\n| Baghdad International Fair | November | A trade fair, showcasing Iraqi products and services |\n| Kurdish Film Festival | December | A film festival, showcasing Kurdish films and directors |\n| Islamic New Year | September-October | A Muslim holiday, marking the beginning of the new Islamic year |\n| Christmas | December | A Christian holiday, celebrated by Iraqi Christians |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Variations [/SECTION]\n- The **Kurdish region** in the north has a milder climate than the rest of the country, with cooler winters and warmer summers.\n- The **desert region** in the west and south is extremely hot during the summer months, with temperatures often reaching 120°F (49°C).\n- The **temperate region** in the north and east receives most of its rainfall during the winter months, making it ideal for outdoor activities during the spring and autumn.\n- The **mountain ranges**, including the Zagros Mountains, offer a unique opportunity for hiking and trekking during the spring and autumn months.\n- The **coastal region** along the Persian Gulf is generally hotter and more humid than the rest of the country, with high temperatures and humidity during the summer months.\n\n[SECTION] Practical Tips [/SECTION]\n- Book accommodations and flights well in advance, especially during peak season.\n- Consider visiting during the shoulder season, from October to November and March to April, for lower prices and smaller crowds.\n- Pack lightweight and breathable clothing, as well as sunscreen and a hat, to protect yourself from the sun.\n- Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water, especially during the summer months.\n- Avoid traveling during the summer months, from June to August, due to the extreme heat and humidity.\n- Respect local customs and traditions, especially during Muslim holidays and festivals.",
