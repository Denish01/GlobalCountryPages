[SECTION] Overview: Iraq vs Syria [/SECTION]
The cost of living in Iraq and Syria varies significantly due to the economic context of each country. Iraq has a relatively stable economy, driven by its oil exports, while Syria is still recovering from a prolonged civil war. As a result, Iraq tends to have lower prices for many everyday items, including food, housing, and transportation. On average, Iraq is around 20-30% cheaper than Syria, making it a more affordable option for expats, students, and retirees.

The economic context of each country also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Iraq's economy is more diversified, with a growing private sector, while Syria's economy is still heavily reliant on government subsidies and international aid. This has led to a shortage of certain goods and services in Syria, driving up prices and making it more expensive for foreigners to live there. Additionally, the security situation in Syria is still unstable, which can increase the cost of living for those who require additional security measures.
