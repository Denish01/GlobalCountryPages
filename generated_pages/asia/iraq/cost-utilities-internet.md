Iraq's utility infrastructure has undergone significant improvements in recent years, with a focus on increasing access to electricity, water, and sanitation. However, the quality of services can still vary depending on the location, with urban areas generally having better infrastructure than rural areas. The costs of utilities in Iraq can fluctuate due to seasonal variation, with electricity and water usage increasing during the hot summer months. Additionally, the Iraqi government has implemented measures to reduce subsidies and increase efficiency in the utility sector, which may lead to changes in pricing and availability.
