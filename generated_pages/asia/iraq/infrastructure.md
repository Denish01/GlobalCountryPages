[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 99% of population
Internet Penetration: 49%
Road Network: 45,000 km, moderate quality with some paved highways and many unpaved rural roads
Rail Network: 2,272 km

[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Iraq's infrastructure has been severely impacted by years of conflict, sanctions, and neglect, resulting in a significant gap between urban and rural areas. While major cities like Baghdad and Basra have seen significant investments in recent years, rural areas still lack access to basic services like electricity, clean water, and sanitation. The government has been working to address these issues, with a focus on rebuilding and expanding the country's infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and public buildings. Recent investments have also been made in the energy sector, with a focus on increasing power generation and reducing reliance on imports.

Despite these efforts, Iraq's infrastructure still faces significant challenges, including a lack of maintenance and investment in existing facilities. The country's infrastructure is also vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, including increased temperatures and changing precipitation patterns. To address these challenges, the government has been working to develop a comprehensive infrastructure plan, which includes investments in renewable energy, water conservation, and green infrastructure.

The urban-rural gap in Iraq's infrastructure is a significant challenge, with many rural areas lacking access to basic services like electricity, clean water, and sanitation. The government has been working to address this issue, with a focus on expanding access to these services in rural areas. However, more work is needed to address the significant infrastructure gap between urban and rural areas.
