The country's overall affordability is reflected in the prices of basic necessities like food, transportation, and housing. However, the cost of living can vary significantly depending on the lifestyle and location. A budget lifestyle in Iraq can go a long way, with $400-700 per month covering basic expenses, while a mid-range lifestyle with $800-1,200 per month can provide a relatively comfortable standard of living. In comparison to neighboring countries, Iraq is generally more affordable than Turkey and Iran, but less affordable than Jordan and Kuwait.\n\nThe cost of living in Iraq is also influenced by the country's economic conditions, including an inflation rate of -12.3% in 2024. This means that the prices of goods and services are decreasing, making it easier for individuals to afford basic necessities. However, the out-of-pocket health spend of 54.0% in 2023 is a significant concern, as it can be a major expense for individuals and families. Overall, Iraq's cost of living is relatively low, but it can vary significantly depending on the lifestyle and location.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Breakdown [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Category | Budget ($) | Mid-Range ($) | Comfortable ($) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rent (1BR apartment) | 100-200 | 250-400 | 500-800 | (budget=shared/outside, mid=1BR center, comfortable=nice 2BR) |\n| Food & Groceries | 100-150 | 200-300 | 400-600 | (budget=cook mostly, mid=mix, comfortable=eat out often) |\n| Transportation | 20-50 | 50-100 | 100-200 | (budget=public only, mid=mix, comfortable=taxi/car) |\n| Utilities & Internet | 50-100 | 100-150 | 200-300 | (electricity, water, internet, phone) |\n| Healthcare / Insurance | 20-50 | 50-100 | 100-200 | (budget=public only, comfortable=private) |\n| Entertainment & Social | 50-100 | 100-200 | 200-400 | (going out, hobbies, gym) |\n| Clothing & Personal | 20-50 | 50-100 | 100-200 | |\n| Savings / Misc | 50-100 | 100-200 | 200-400 | |\n| **Total** | **400-700** | **800-1,200** | **1,500-2,500** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Budget Tier Lifestyles [/SECTION]\nA budget lifestyle in Iraq can be challenging, but it is possible to get by with $400-700 per month.

[/SECTION]\nIraq can be an affordable destination for digital nomads, retirees, and students who are looking for a low-cost lifestyle. The country's low cost of living and relatively low rent prices make it an attractive option for individuals who want to stretch their budget.

Individuals who are considering moving to Iraq should carefully weigh the pros and cons and consider factors such as safety, job opportunities, and healthcare costs before making a decision. With careful planning and research, it is possible to have a comfortable and affordable lifestyle in Iraq, but it is essential to be mindful of the country's unique challenges and limitations.",
