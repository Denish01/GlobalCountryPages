The system is overseen by the Iraqi Ministry of Education, which is responsible for setting curriculum standards, administering exams, and managing the education budget. The quality of education in Iraq varies, with some schools and universities offering high-quality instruction, while others struggle with inadequate resources and infrastructure. Public education is free and compulsory for all citizens, but private schools and universities are also available, offering a range of options for students who can afford them.\n\nThe education system in Iraq has faced significant challenges in recent years, including a lack of funding, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage of qualified teachers. Despite these challenges, the system has made significant progress, with enrollment rates increasing and more students pursuing higher education. The Iraqi government has also implemented a range of reforms aimed at improving the quality of education, including the introduction of new curriculum standards and the establishment of a national assessment system.\n\nOne of the major challenges facing the education system in Iraq is the lack of resources, particularly in rural areas. Many schools lack basic infrastructure, such as electricity, water, and sanitation facilities, making it difficult for students to learn. Additionally, the system is heavily centralized, with the Ministry of Education controlling most aspects of education, including curriculum, teacher training, and assessment. This can make it difficult for schools and universities to innovate and respond to local needs.\n\n[SECTION] Top Universities [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| University | Location | Known For | Est.
