The quality of public transit varies significantly between cities, with Baghdad having the most comprehensive network of buses and minivans. However, the lack of a well-organized and efficient public transportation system makes it challenging for visitors to navigate the country. In major cities like Baghdad and Basra, traffic congestion is a significant issue, and roads are often in poor condition.\n\nThe most common modes of transportation in Iraq are taxis, minivans, and private cars. Many Iraqis own private vehicles, and the country has a high rate of car ownership. However, the lack of a reliable public transportation system makes it difficult for those who cannot afford private vehicles to get around. In recent years, ride-hailing apps like Uber and Careem have become popular in major cities, providing an alternative to traditional taxis. Despite the challenges, the Iraqi government has been working to improve the transportation infrastructure, including the development of new roads and highways.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.20-$0.50 | $10-$20 | Limited coverage, often overcrowded |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available in most cities |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $0.50-$1.00 | N/A | Covers most routes, but can be crowded |\n| Commuter Train | $1.00-$2.00 | $20-$50 | Limited routes, mostly connecting major cities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $2.00-$3.00 | $0.50-$1.00 | $5.00-$10.00 | Not always available, may not use meter |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $2.00-$3.00 | $0.50-$1.00 | $5.00-$10.00 | Uber, Careem available in major cities |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $10.00-$20.00 | Varies depending on airport and city |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $0.60 | Subsidized by the government |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $0.50 | Subsidized by the government |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$100 | Economy car, prices vary depending on agency |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1.00-$2.00 | Limited parking options, often crowded |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $2.00-$5.00 | Limited toll roads, mostly connecting major cities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$20 | Limited routes, often crowded |\n| Domestic Flight | $50-$100 | Limited routes, mostly connecting major cities |\n| Train (long-distance) | $20-$50 | Limited routes, mostly connecting major cities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider using public buses or minivans, which are often cheaper than taxis.\n- Ride-hailing apps like Uber and Careem are widely available in major cities and can be a convenient option.\n- When taking a taxi, it's essential to negotiate the fare before starting the journey to avoid overcharging.\n- Be aware of your surroundings and keep an eye on your belongings, especially in crowded areas.\n- Consider renting a car or hiring a private driver for long-distance trips, as public transportation options may be limited.\n- Download local maps or transportation apps to help navigate the country and find the best routes.",
