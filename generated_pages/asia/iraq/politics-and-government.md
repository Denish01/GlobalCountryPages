[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Iraq is based on the principles of federalism, with power divided between the central government and the regional authorities. The **separation of powers** is enshrined in the constitution, with the executive, legislative, and judicial branches each having distinct roles. The **federal system** allows for a degree of autonomy for the regions, with the Kurdistan Region in the north having its own regional government. The political system is also influenced by **Islamic law**, with the constitution stating that Islam is the official religion and a source of legislation.

The government is headed by a **President**, who serves as the head of state, and a **Prime Minister**, who is the head of government. The President is elected by the Council of Representatives, the unicameral legislature, for a four-year term. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President and is responsible for forming a government. The Council of Representatives has 329 seats, with members elected by proportional representation for a four-year term.

The political system in Iraq is designed to balance the power of the different branches of government and to protect the rights of the citizens. However, the system has been criticized for being complex and prone to deadlock, with the different branches of government often struggling to work together effectively.
