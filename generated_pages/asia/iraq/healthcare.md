[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Iraq's healthcare system is a mix of public and private providers, with the public sector being the primary source of healthcare for the majority of the population. The public healthcare system is overseen by the Ministry of Health, which operates a network of hospitals, clinics, and health centers throughout the country. However, the public sector faces significant challenges, including a shortage of medical professionals, inadequate infrastructure, and limited access to quality care, particularly in rural areas. In contrast, the private sector offers higher-quality care, but it is often expensive and inaccessible to many Iraqis. The quality of care varies significantly depending on the location, with urban areas generally having better access to quality healthcare than rural areas.

The healthcare system in Iraq is also facing significant challenges due to the country's security situation, which has led to a brain drain of medical professionals and a shortage of essential medical supplies. Additionally, the system is often plagued by corruption, which can limit access to quality care, particularly for those who cannot afford to pay bribes. Despite these challenges, the Iraqi government has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, including investing in new infrastructure and equipment, and increasing the number of medical professionals.

Overall, while Iraq's healthcare system has the potential to provide quality care, it is often hindered by significant challenges, including a shortage of medical professionals, inadequate infrastructure, and limited access to quality care, particularly in rural areas. As a result, many Iraqis, particularly those in rural areas, often rely on traditional medicine or travel to other countries for medical care.
