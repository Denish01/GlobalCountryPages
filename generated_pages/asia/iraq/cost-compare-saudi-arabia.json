Iraq's economy has been heavily reliant on oil exports, while Saudi Arabia has been diversifying its economy in recent years. In terms of cost of living, Iraq is generally cheaper than Saudi Arabia, with lower prices for accommodation, food, and transportation. The cost of living in Iraq is approximately 30-40% lower than in Saudi Arabia, making it an attractive option for those looking for a more affordable lifestyle. However, it's essential to note that the cost of living in Iraq can vary significantly depending on the location, with cities like Baghdad and Basra tend to be more expensive than smaller towns and rural areas.\n\nThe economic context of both countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Iraq's economy has been affected by years of conflict and instability, which has led to a decline in the value of the Iraqi dinar (IQD) and higher inflation rates. In contrast, Saudi Arabia's economy has been more stable, with a stronger currency and lower inflation rates. However, the cost of living in Saudi Arabia is still relatively high, especially in cities like Riyadh and Jeddah, where the demand for housing and other services is high. Overall, while both countries have their unique challenges and opportunities, Iraq is generally the more affordable option for those looking to live and work in the region.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Iraq (USD) | Saudi Arabia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | $200 | $400 | 50% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | $150 | $300 | 50% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | $400 | $800 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Iraq (USD) | Saudi Arabia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | $5 | $10 | 50% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | $100 | $200 | 50% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | $2 | $5 | 60% cheaper |\n| Coffee | $1 | $2 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Iraq (USD) | Saudi Arabia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | $10 | $20 | 50% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | $0.50 | $1 | 50% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $0.50 | $0.75 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Iraq (USD) | Saudi Arabia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | $50 | $100 | 50% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | $20 | $30 | 33% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | $10 | $20 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Iraq (USD) | Saudi Arabia (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | $500 | $800 | 37% |\n| Mid-Range | $1,000 | $1,500 | 33% |\n| Comfortable | $2,000 | $3,000 | 33% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Iraq is cheaper for:**\n  - Rent and housing, with prices 50% lower than in Saudi Arabia\n  - Food and dining, with meals and groceries 50% cheaper\n  - Transportation, with taxi fares and fuel prices 33-50% lower\n  - Utilities and internet, with bills 33-50% cheaper\n- **Saudi Arabia is cheaper for:**\n  - High-end shopping and entertainment, with a wider range of options and lower prices\n  - International travel, with more flights and destinations available\n  - Luxury accommodations, with higher-end hotels and resorts\n  - Business and investment opportunities, with a more stable and diversified economy\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nFor expats, students, and retirees looking for a more affordable lifestyle, Iraq may be the better option.
