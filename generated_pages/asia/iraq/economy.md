[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Iraq has an upper-middle income economy, driven primarily by its vast oil reserves, which account for the majority of the country's revenue. The economy has experienced significant fluctuations over the years due to various factors such as wars, sanctions, and internal conflicts. Despite these challenges, Iraq has made efforts to diversify its economy and reduce its dependence on oil exports. The country's economic development level is still considered to be in the developing stage, with a large public sector and a growing private sector.

The Iraqi economy has faced numerous challenges, including corruption, inefficiency, and a lack of investment in key sectors. However, the country has made significant progress in recent years, with the government implementing various reforms aimed at improving the business environment and attracting foreign investment. The economy is expected to continue growing, driven by the oil sector, as well as investments in other key sectors such as agriculture, manufacturing, and construction.

Iraq's economic trajectory is closely tied to the global oil market, and the country's economy is highly vulnerable to fluctuations in oil prices. However, the government has taken steps to reduce this vulnerability, including investing in other sectors and implementing policies to promote economic diversification. Despite these efforts, the economy still faces significant challenges, including a large budget deficit, high unemployment, and a lack of infrastructure.
