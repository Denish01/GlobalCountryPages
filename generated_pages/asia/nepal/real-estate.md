[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The property market in Nepal is growing, driven by increasing demand for housing and commercial spaces, particularly in urban areas. The market is characterized by a mix of traditional and modern properties, with a focus on apartments and houses in the capital city of Kathmandu. In recent years, the market has seen a steady increase in prices, with a growth rate of around 10% per annum. However, the market is still relatively affordable compared to other countries in the region. The urban areas, such as Kathmandu and Pokhara, are more developed and have a higher demand for properties, while the rural areas are still largely undeveloped and have limited access to basic amenities.

The government has implemented various policies to encourage investment in the property sector, including tax incentives and subsidies for developers. However, the market is still largely unregulated, and there are concerns about the lack of transparency and accountability. The market is also vulnerable to fluctuations in the global economy, as well as domestic factors such as political instability and natural disasters. Despite these challenges, the property market in Nepal offers opportunities for investors, particularly in the tourism and hospitality sectors.

The price trajectory of properties in Nepal varies depending on the location, with urban areas tend to be more expensive than rural areas. The demand for properties in urban areas is driven by the growing middle class and the increasing number of tourists and expatriates. The government has also implemented various initiatives to promote tourism and investment in the country, which is expected to drive growth in the property market.
