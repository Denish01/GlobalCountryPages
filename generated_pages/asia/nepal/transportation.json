The airport is well-connected to major hubs in Asia, Europe, and the Middle East, with direct flights available from cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, Bangkok, and Dubai. Additionally, Nepal can be reached overland from India and China, with several border crossings open to foreigners, including the popular Birgunj-Raxaul crossing from India.\n\nFor those traveling overland, there are several bus and taxi services available from the border towns to major cities in Nepal, including Kathmandu, Pokhara, and Chitwan. The journey can be long and arduous, but it offers a unique glimpse into the country's rural landscapes and cultures. It's also possible to hire a private vehicle or join a guided tour to make the journey more comfortable and convenient.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nNepal has an extensive domestic air network, with several airlines operating flights to major towns and cities, including Buddha Air, Yeti Airlines, and Shree Airlines. The main routes connect Kathmandu to popular tourist destinations such as Pokhara, Lukla, and Bharatpur, with frequent flights available throughout the day. Booking in advance is recommended, especially during peak travel seasons, and approximate costs range from $50 to $200 for a one-way ticket, depending on the route and airline. It's also worth noting that domestic flights can be affected by weather conditions, especially in the mountains, so it's essential to check the latest flight schedules and weather forecasts before traveling.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nNepal's rail network is limited, with only a few routes operating in the southern part of the country, near the border with India. The most notable route connects Jaynagar in India to Bijalpura in Nepal, with a journey time of around 6 hours. However, the train service is not well-developed, and journeys can be slow and uncomfortable. There are no high-speed rail options available in Nepal, and the booking process can be complicated, with limited online resources and English language support.\n\n[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]\nNepal has an extensive network of buses and coaches, connecting major towns and cities, including tourist destinations such as Pokhara, Chitwan, and Lumbini. The bus services are generally affordable, with costs ranging from $5 to $20 for a one-way ticket, depending on the route and quality of service. However, the journey can be long and arduous, especially on the country's poor roads, and the buses can be crowded and uncomfortable. Several bus companies operate in Nepal, including the government-run Sajha Yatayat and private operators such as Greenline and Golden Bus, offering a range of services from basic to deluxe.\n\n[SECTION] City Transport [/SECTION]\n| Mode | Available In | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | Kathmandu, Pokhara | $0.20-$0.50 | frequent services, but can be crowded |\n| Taxi | everywhere | $5-$10/km | metered taxis available in major cities |\n| Ride-Hailing | Kathmandu, Pokhara | $3-$5 | local alternatives such as Pathao and Tootle |\n| Tuk-tuk/Rickshaw | Kathmandu, Pokhara | $2-$5 | available for short journeys, but can be expensive |\n| Cycling | Kathmandu, Pokhara | $5-$10/day | a great way to explore the city, with bike rental shops available |\n\n[SECTION] Driving [/SECTION]\n- To drive in Nepal, you'll need a valid international driving license, which can be obtained in your home country or in Nepal, with a temporary license available for tourists.\n- The road conditions in Nepal are generally poor, with many roads being unpaved or under construction, especially in rural areas.\n- Fuel costs are relatively low in Nepal, with petrol and diesel available at most roadside stations.\n- Car rental services are available in major cities, including Kathmandu and Pokhara, with a range of vehicles available, from small cars to 4x4s and buses.\n- When driving in Nepal, be aware of the local traffic rules and customs, including driving on the left-hand side of the road and giving way to pedestrians and livestock.\n- Hazards on the road can include poor road conditions, aggressive driving, and stray animals, so it's essential to drive defensively and cautiously.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be aware of scams and overcharging, especially when using taxis or ride-hailing services, and always agree on the fare before starting your journey.\n- Learn some basic Nepali phrases, such as \"kati paisa?\" (how much money?), to help you navigate the transportation system.\n- Download local apps such as Pathao and Tootle to book ride-hailing services and taxis.\n- Always wear a seatbelt and helmet when driving or riding a vehicle, as road safety is a major concern in Nepal.\n- Be prepared for delays and cancellations, especially during peak travel seasons or in bad weather, and have a backup plan in place.\n- Respect local customs and traditions when using public transportation, such as giving up your seat to elderly or disabled passengers.\n- Keep your valuables safe and secure, especially in crowded buses and trains, and be mindful of pickpocketing and theft.",
