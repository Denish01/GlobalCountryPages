[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Nepal is a sovereign country with a lower-middle-income economy, driven primarily by agriculture, remittances, and tourism. The country's economy has been steadily growing over the past few decades, with a GDP growth rate of around 6-7% per annum. However, the economy still faces significant challenges, including a large trade deficit, high dependence on imports, and limited economic diversification. Nepal's economic development is also hindered by its landlocked geography, limited access to markets, and inadequate infrastructure.

Nepal's economy is largely driven by the service sector, which accounts for around 50% of the country's GDP. The industrial sector, including manufacturing and construction, accounts for around 20% of GDP, while agriculture accounts for around 30%. The country's economy is also heavily reliant on remittances from Nepali workers abroad, which accounts for around 25% of GDP. The government has been implementing various policies to promote economic growth, including investment in infrastructure, promotion of tourism, and encouragement of foreign investment.

Despite these efforts, Nepal's economy still faces significant challenges, including a large trade deficit and high dependence on imports. The country's trade deficit is largely driven by its high dependence on imports of goods such as petroleum products, machinery, and electronics. To address these challenges, the government has been implementing policies to promote export-led growth, including the establishment of special economic zones and the provision of incentives to exporters.
