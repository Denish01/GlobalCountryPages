  "content": "[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]\nNepal has a rich and diverse history that spans over two thousand years. The country's strategic location in the Himalayas has made it a significant cultural and trade hub between **India** and **China**. The recorded history of Nepal began with the **Shakya** dynasty in the 6th century BC, which is said to be the birthplace of **Buddha**. The country was later ruled by the **Lichhavi** dynasty, followed by the **Malla** dynasty, which split into three kingdoms: **Kantipur**, **Lalitpur**, and **Bhaktapur**. In 1768, the **Shah** dynasty unified the three kingdoms and established the Kingdom of Nepal. Nepal remained an independent kingdom until it became a **federal democratic republic** in 2008.\n\nNepal's independence was never formally colonized by any European power, but it was heavily influenced by **British India**. The country signed the **Treaty of Betrawati** with British India in 1816, which established Nepal as a **protectorate** of British India. This treaty allowed Nepal to maintain its internal autonomy while ceding control over its foreign affairs to British India. Nepal's relationship with British India remained complex, with the country playing a significant role in the **Anglo-Nepal War** of 1814-1816.\n\nThe 20th century saw significant changes in Nepal's political landscape.
