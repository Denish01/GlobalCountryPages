Nepal offers various types of visas, including tourist, business, student, and work visas. The country has also introduced an online visa application system, making it easier for travelers to apply for their visas in advance.

[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]
**Tourists:** Tourists can obtain a visa-on-arrival at Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu or at various land border crossings. The typical stay for tourists is 15, 30, or 90 days, depending on the type of visa. Extensions are possible, but must be applied for at the Department of Immigration in Kathmandu. **Business Travelers:** Business travelers must apply for a business visa, which requires an invitation letter from a Nepalese company or organization. The application process can take several days, and the visa is usually valid for a shorter period than a tourist visa. **Students:** Students must apply for a student visa, which requires proof of enrollment at a Nepalese educational institution. The visa is usually valid for the duration of the course, and students must register with the Department of Immigration within seven days of arrival. **Workers:** Workers must apply for a work visa, which requires sponsorship from a Nepalese employer. The application process can take several weeks, and the visa is usually valid for a specific period.

[SECTION] Entry Points & Procedures [/SECTION]
The main entry point for international travelers is Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu, which is served by several major airlines. Land border crossings are also possible, particularly for travelers from India and China. Upon arrival, travelers must complete a customs declaration form and present their passport and visa (if required) to the immigration officer. The officer will then issue a visa (if applicable) and stamp the traveler's passport with the permitted duration of stay. Travelers must also declare any restricted or prohibited items, such as firearms, narcotics, or certain types of currency.

Upon arrival, travelers can expect to go through immigration and customs procedures, which can take around 30 minutes to an hour, depending on the time of day and the number of travelers. It is essential to have all required documents ready and to be prepared to answer questions from the immigration officer. Travelers can also hire a porter or taxi to help with their luggage and transportation to their destination.
