[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Nepal has a diverse climate, ranging from tropical to alpine, depending on the elevation. The country can be divided into three main climate zones: the **Terai** region in the south, which is hot and humid, the **Hill** region, which is mild and temperate, and the **Himalayan** region, which is cold and dry. The dry season, which lasts from October to May, is the best time to visit Nepal, as it offers clear skies and pleasant temperatures. The wet season, which lasts from June to September, is characterized by heavy rainfall and potential landslides, making it less ideal for travel.

The seasons in Nepal have a significant impact on travel, as some areas may be inaccessible during the monsoon season due to flooding and landslides. The dry season, on the other hand, is ideal for trekking and outdoor activities, as the weather is generally clear and stable. However, this also means that popular trekking routes can be crowded, and prices for accommodations and tours may be higher.

The **monsoon season**, which lasts from June to September, is not ideal for travel, as the heavy rainfall can cause flooding and landslides, making it difficult to access some areas. However, this season is also a time of great beauty, as the countryside is lush and green, and the waterfalls are at their peak. If you're planning to visit Nepal during the monsoon season, it's essential to be prepared for the potential risks and to plan your itinerary accordingly.
