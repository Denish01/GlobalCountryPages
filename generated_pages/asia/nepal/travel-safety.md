[SECTION] Overall Safety Assessment [/SECTION]
Nepal is generally a safe country to visit, with low crime rates compared to other countries in the region. However, as with any travel destination, there are certain risks and precautions that visitors should be aware of. The country has a strong focus on tourism, and the government has taken steps to improve safety and security for visitors. The majority of crimes against tourists are petty, such as pickpocketing or scams, and violent crime is relatively rare. Nevertheless, visitors should still take necessary precautions to protect themselves and their belongings.

Nepal is also prone to natural disasters, such as earthquakes and landslides, which can pose a significant risk to travelers. The country is still recovering from the devastating 2015 earthquake, and some areas may still be affected by the aftermath. Additionally, the country's healthcare system can be limited, especially in rural areas, and visitors may need to take extra precautions to stay healthy. Overall, with some basic precautions and awareness of the local conditions, Nepal can be a very safe and rewarding destination to visit.
