The quality of public transit varies greatly between cities, with Kathmandu having a more comprehensive network compared to other cities. However, the roads can be congested, and traffic can be a major issue, especially during peak hours. Many locals also rely on walking or cycling as a mode of transportation, especially for shorter distances.\n\nThe main transportation modes in Nepal include buses, which are the most affordable option, and taxis, which are more convenient but also more expensive. Rickshaws are also a popular mode of transportation, especially for shorter distances. The government has also introduced initiatives to improve the public transportation system, including the introduction of new bus routes and the development of a metro system in Kathmandu. However, the progress has been slow, and the transportation network still faces many challenges, including congestion and pollution.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.20-$0.50 | $10-$15 | Limited coverage, crowded |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available, except for a proposed metro system in Kathmandu |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $0.50-$1.00 | N/A | Covers most routes, but can be crowded |\n| Commuter Train | $1.00-$2.00 | $20-$30 | Limited routes, mostly for tourist areas |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $1.00-$2.00 | $0.50-$1.00 | $3-$5 | Be sure to negotiate the fare before starting the ride |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $1.00-$2.00 | $0.20-$0.50 | $2-$4 | Pathao, Tootle, and Sarathi are popular options |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $10-$20 | Pre-booked transfers are recommended |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20-$1.50 | Prices vary depending on location and taxes |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.00-$1.30 | Prices vary depending on location and taxes |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $30-$50 | Economy car, prices vary depending on rental agency |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-$2 | Prices vary depending on location and availability |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $1-$5 | Limited toll roads, mostly for highways |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $5-$10 | Limited comfort, but affordable |\n| Domestic Flight | $50-$100 | Quick and convenient, but expensive |\n| Train (long-distance) | $10-$20 | Limited routes, mostly for tourist areas |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be sure to negotiate the fare before starting a taxi ride, as meters are not always used.\n- Use ride-hailing apps like Pathao, Tootle, and Sarathi for a more convenient and affordable option.\n- Consider purchasing a monthly transit pass for frequent travel on city buses.\n- Be cautious when crossing roads, as traffic can be chaotic.\n- Avoid traveling during peak hours to avoid congestion and traffic.\n- Consider hiring a private car and driver for long-distance travel, as it can be more convenient and comfortable.",
