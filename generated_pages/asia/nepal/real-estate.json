The market is characterized by a mix of traditional and modern properties, with a focus on apartments and houses in the capital city of Kathmandu. In recent years, the market has seen a steady increase in prices, with a growth rate of around 10% per annum. However, the market is still relatively affordable compared to other countries in the region. The urban areas, such as Kathmandu and Pokhara, are more developed and have a higher demand for properties, while the rural areas are still largely undeveloped and have limited access to basic amenities.\n\nThe government has implemented various policies to encourage investment in the property sector, including tax incentives and subsidies for developers. However, the market is still largely unregulated, and there are concerns about the lack of transparency and accountability. The market is also vulnerable to fluctuations in the global economy, as well as domestic factors such as political instability and natural disasters. Despite these challenges, the property market in Nepal offers opportunities for investors, particularly in the tourism and hospitality sectors.\n\nThe price trajectory of properties in Nepal varies depending on the location, with urban areas tend to be more expensive than rural areas. The demand for properties in urban areas is driven by the growing middle class and the increasing number of tourists and expatriates. The government has also implemented various initiatives to promote tourism and investment in the country, which is expected to drive growth in the property market.\n\n[SECTION] Prices by Area [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area/City | Buy (per sqm, USD) | Rent (monthly, USD) | Type |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Kathmandu | 1,200 | 200 | Apartment |\n| Pokhara | 800 | 150 | House |\n| Chitwan | 500 | 100 | Land |\n| Lalitpur | 1,000 | 180 | Apartment |\n| Bhaktapur | 900 | 160 | House |\n| Nagarkot | 600 | 120 | Land |\n| Dhulikhel | 700 | 140 | House |\n| Butwal | 400 | 90 | Land |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Ownership Rules [/SECTION]\n- Foreigners can buy property in Nepal, but they must obtain permission from the government and meet certain requirements, such as investing a minimum amount of money in the country.\n- Foreigners can also lease property in Nepal for a period of up to 50 years, which can be renewed.\n- Foreign companies can own property in Nepal, but they must be registered with the government and meet certain requirements.\n- Foreigners must obtain a **work permit** and a **residence visa** to live and work in Nepal.\n- Foreigners must also obtain permission from the **Nepal Rastra Bank** to purchase property in Nepal.\n\n[SECTION] Buying Process [/SECTION]\n1.
