  "content": "The primary language spoken in Nepal is **Nepali**, also known as Nepalese, which is the official language of the country and widely understood by the majority of the population.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nOfficial Language(s): Nepali\nWidely Spoken: English, Hindi, Maithili, Bhojpuri\nEnglish Proficiency: Moderate\nScript: Devanagari\nLanguage Family: Sino-Tibetan\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]\nNepal has a diverse linguistic landscape, with over 100 languages spoken across the country. **Nepali** is the most widely spoken language and is used as the primary means of communication in government, education, and media. However, there are many regional dialects and minority languages spoken in different parts of the country, including **Tharu**, **Tamang**, and **Newari**. English is also widely spoken, particularly in tourist areas and among the educated population, but proficiency levels can vary greatly. In general, English is more widely understood in urban areas such as **Kathmandu** and **Pokhara**, while in rural areas, **Nepali** and local dialects are more commonly spoken.\n\nThe country's linguistic diversity is also reflected in the many languages spoken by different ethnic groups. For example, the **Sherpa** people, who are known for their mountaineering skills, speak a language called **Sherpa**, which is also known as **Solukhumbu**. Similarly, the **Gurung** people, who are known for their traditional clothing and music, speak a language called **Gurung**, which is also known as **Tamang**. Overall, Nepal's linguistic landscape is complex and diverse, reflecting the country's rich cultural heritage.\n\nDespite the many languages spoken in Nepal, **Nepali** is the language that is most widely understood and used as a **lingua franca**. It is the language of government, education, and media, and is widely used in business and commerce. As a result, visitors to Nepal can get by with just **Nepali** and English, although learning a few words of the local dialects can go a long way in terms of building relationships with the local people.\n\n[SECTION] Essential Phrases [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| English | Local Language | Pronunciation | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hello | Namaste | NAH-mah-steh | formal |\n| Thank you | Dhanyabaad | DHAH-nyah-bahd |  |\n| Please | Kripaya | KREE-pah-yah |  |\n| Yes / No | Ha / Hoina | HA / HOY-nah |  |\n| Excuse me | Maaf gara | MAH-f gah-rah |  |\n| How much? | Kati paisa | KAH-tee PY-sah |  |\n| Where is...? | Kaha cha? | KAH-hah CHAH |  |\n| I don't understand | Maile bujhina | MY-lay BOO-jhee-nah |  |\n| Do you speak English? | Tapai Angreji bolnuhunchha? | TAH-pie ahn-GREH-jee BOHL-noo-hoon-chah |  |\n| Help! | Sahayog gara | SAH-hah-yog gah-rah |  |\n| Goodbye | Chhaibhai | CHAI-bah-ee | informal |\n| Sorry | Maaf gara | MAH-f gah-rah |  |\n| How are you? | Kasto cha? | KAH-stoh CHAH |  |\n| What is your name? | Tapai ko naam ke ho? | TAH-pie koh NAH-m kay HO |  |\n| I am from... | Ma...bata | MAH...BAH-tah |  |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Numbers & Bargaining [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Number | Local Word | Pronunciation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Ek | EHK |\n| 2 | Dui | DOO-ee |\n| 3 | Teen | TAYN |\n| 4 | Char | CHAHR |\n| 5 | Paanch | PAHN-ch |\n| 6 | Chha | CHAH |\n| 7 | Saat | SAH-t |\n| 8 | Aath | AHTH |\n| 9 | Nau | NAH-oo |\n| 10 | Das | DAH-s |\n| 100 | Ek sau | EHK SAH-oo |\n| 1000 | Ek hazaar | EHK HAH-zar |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Communication Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be respectful of the local culture and customs, and try to learn a few words of **Nepali** to show your appreciation.\n- Use both hands when giving or receiving something, as using one hand can be considered impolite.\n- Avoid public displays of affection, as they are generally frowned upon in Nepali culture.\n- Remove your shoes when entering a temple or a private home, as a sign of respect.\n- Use polite language and avoid using slang or colloquialisms.\n- Be patient and try to understand the local dialects and accents, as they can be quite different from standard **Nepali**.\n- Avoid talking about sensitive topics such as politics or religion, as they can be controversial.\n- Use **Namaste** as a greeting, as it is a respectful and traditional way to greet someone.\n\n[SECTION] Translation Tools & Resources [/SECTION]\n- Download a translation app such as **Google Translate** or **iTranslate** to help you communicate with the locals.\n- Carry a phrasebook or a dictionary to help you learn **Nepali** words and phrases.\n- Take a language course or hire a local guide to help you learn **Nepali** and navigate the local culture.\n- Use online resources such as **Language Exchange** or **italki** to practice your **Nepali** language skills.\n- Listen to **Nepali** music and watch **Nepali** movies to get a feel for the language and culture.",
