[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Nepal's healthcare system is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public sector is responsible for providing healthcare to the majority of the population, with a network of government-run hospitals and health centers. However, the private sector is also significant, with many private hospitals and clinics, especially in urban areas, offering high-quality care to those who can afford it. The quality of care in Nepal's healthcare system can vary significantly, with urban areas generally having better-equipped and staffed facilities than rural areas. In general, public hospitals are overcrowded and understaffed, while private hospitals offer more personalized care and better facilities.

The government has implemented various initiatives to improve healthcare in Nepal, including the introduction of a national health insurance scheme and the expansion of healthcare services to rural areas. However, challenges persist, including a shortage of healthcare professionals, inadequate infrastructure, and limited access to specialized care. Despite these challenges, Nepal has made significant progress in improving healthcare outcomes in recent years, with significant reductions in infant and maternal mortality rates.

In terms of access, urban areas such as Kathmandu and Pokhara have a relatively high concentration of healthcare facilities, including hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies. However, rural areas often have limited access to healthcare services, with many communities relying on traditional medicine or traveling long distances to reach a healthcare facility. The government has implemented various initiatives to improve access to healthcare in rural areas, including the establishment of community health worker programs and the deployment of mobile health clinics.
