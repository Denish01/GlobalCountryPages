[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Nepal's healthcare system is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, with limited resources and long wait times, while private hospitals and clinics offer higher quality care but at a significantly higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only option, while foreigners and those who can afford it tend to opt for private care. Insurance is not mandatory, but it is highly recommended, especially for foreigners, as medical costs can quickly add up.

The healthcare system in Nepal is also heavily reliant on out-of-pocket payments, with 59.4% of healthcare expenditure coming from individuals. This can be a significant burden for many people, especially those living in rural areas where access to healthcare services is limited. Despite these challenges, the Nepalese government has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, including the introduction of a national health insurance program and the expansion of healthcare services to rural areas.
