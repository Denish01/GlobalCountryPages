  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Nepal can vary greatly, with public services generally being more affordable but often overcrowded and understaffed, while private services offer higher quality care at a significantly higher cost, with an average health expenditure per capita of $84.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $84\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 59.4%\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 102\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: NPR\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nNepal's healthcare system is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, with limited resources and long wait times, while private hospitals and clinics offer higher quality care but at a significantly higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only option, while foreigners and those who can afford it tend to opt for private care. Insurance is not mandatory, but it is highly recommended, especially for foreigners, as medical costs can quickly add up.\n\nThe healthcare system in Nepal is also heavily reliant on out-of-pocket payments, with 59.4% of healthcare expenditure coming from individuals. This can be a significant burden for many people, especially those living in rural areas where access to healthcare services is limited. Despite these challenges, the Nepalese government has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, including the introduction of a national health insurance program and the expansion of healthcare services to rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $5-10 | $20-50 | |\n| Specialist Consultation | $10-20 | $50-100 | |\n| Dental Checkup | $5-10 | $20-50 | |\n| Eye Exam | $5-10 | $20-50 | |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-20 | $30-70 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $20-50 | |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $30-100 | |\n| Basic Surgery | $200-500 | |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $200-500 | |\n| MRI Scan | $100-300 | |\n| X-Ray | $10-30 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $10-20 | Outpatient care, basic hospitalization |\n| Comprehensive Private | $50-100 | Inpatient and outpatient care, specialist consultations, surgeries |\n| International / Expat | $100-200 | Global coverage, including Nepal, with higher limits and more comprehensive benefits |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Common medications such as **antibiotics** and **painkillers** can cost between $5-10 per prescription\n- **Prescription rules** vary, but many medications are available over-the-counter\n- **Pharmacy availability** is generally good in urban areas, but limited in rural areas\n- **Over-the-counter medications** are widely available, but quality can vary\n- **Vaccinations** are available at public health clinics and private hospitals, with costs ranging from $10-50\n- **Specialized medications**, such as those for chronic conditions, can be more expensive, with costs ranging from $20-100 per month\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is best to call the emergency number, 102, or head to the nearest hospital. **Ambulance services** are available, but may not always be reliable, especially in rural areas.
