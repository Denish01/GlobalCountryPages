[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Nepal's population is relatively large compared to its land area, resulting in a high population density. The country's population has been growing steadily over the years, with an average annual growth rate of 1.1%. However, the growth rate has been declining gradually due to a decrease in fertility rates and an increase in urbanization. Nepal's population is predominantly rural, with approximately 79.5% of the population living in rural areas. The urban population is concentrated in major cities such as Kathmandu, Pokhara, and Chitwan. Migration patterns in Nepal are primarily driven by economic factors, with many people moving from rural areas to urban centers in search of better job opportunities.

The population of Nepal is also characterized by a high level of youth, with approximately 40% of the population under the age of 18. This demographic trend has significant implications for the country's development, as it presents both opportunities and challenges. On the one hand, a large youth population can provide a significant workforce and contribute to the country's economic growth. On the other hand, it also poses challenges in terms of providing education, employment, and healthcare services to this demographic group.

Nepal's population has also been affected by international migration, with many Nepalis moving to countries such as India, the United Arab Emirates, and Malaysia in search of work. This has resulted in a significant flow of remittances into the country, which has contributed to the country's economic growth. However, it has also raised concerns about the impact of migration on the country's social and cultural fabric.
