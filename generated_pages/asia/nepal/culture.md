# Nepal Culture - Food, Traditions & Etiquette

[SECTION] Cultural Identity [/SECTION]
Nepal's culture is a rich and diverse tapestry, woven from the threads of its geographic location, history, and ethnic makeup. The country is situated in the Himalayas, bordering China to the north and India to the south, east, and west, making it a unique cultural crossroads. Nepali culture is defined by its **Hindu** and **Buddhist** traditions, with a significant influence from **Tibetan** culture in the north. The country is home to over 100 ethnic groups, each with their own language, customs, and traditions. The largest ethnic groups include the **Chhetri**, **Brahmin**, **Tharu**, and **Tamang**.

The cultural identity of Nepal is also shaped by its history, with the country being a kingdom for over 1,500 years. The **Malla** and **Shah** dynasties played a significant role in shaping the country's culture, architecture, and art. The influence of **Indian** and **Tibetan** cultures is evident in Nepal's cuisine, festivals, and traditions. The country's unique cultural heritage is reflected in its vibrant cities, historic temples, and bustling markets. The **Nepali** language, which is the official language, is spoken by the majority of the population, although many other languages are also spoken, including **Maithili**, **Bhojpuri**, and **Tharu**.

Nepal's cultural diversity is also reflected in its **caste system**, which is still prevalent in many parts of the country. The system is based on the principles of **Hinduism**, with different castes having different roles and responsibilities. However, the system has been criticized for perpetuating social inequality and discrimination. Despite this, the Nepali people are known for their warm hospitality and welcoming nature, making visitors feel at home.
