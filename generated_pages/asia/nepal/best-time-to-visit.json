Peak season: October to November. Budget season: April to May. Avoid: June to August due to the monsoon season and potential landslides, and December to February if you're sensitive to cold temperatures. [/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]\nNepal has a diverse climate, ranging from tropical to alpine, depending on the elevation. The country can be divided into three main climate zones: the **Terai** region in the south, which is hot and humid, the **Hill** region, which is mild and temperate, and the **Himalayan** region, which is cold and dry. The dry season, which lasts from October to May, is the best time to visit Nepal, as it offers clear skies and pleasant temperatures. The wet season, which lasts from June to September, is characterized by heavy rainfall and potential landslides, making it less ideal for travel.\n\nThe seasons in Nepal have a significant impact on travel, as some areas may be inaccessible during the monsoon season due to flooding and landslides. The dry season, on the other hand, is ideal for trekking and outdoor activities, as the weather is generally clear and stable. However, this also means that popular trekking routes can be crowded, and prices for accommodations and tours may be higher.\n\nThe **monsoon season**, which lasts from June to September, is not ideal for travel, as the heavy rainfall can cause flooding and landslides, making it difficult to access some areas. However, this season is also a time of great beauty, as the countryside is lush and green, and the waterfalls are at their peak. If you're planning to visit Nepal during the monsoon season, it's essential to be prepared for the potential risks and to plan your itinerary accordingly.\n\n[SECTION] Month-by-Month Guide [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Month | Weather | Crowds | Prices | Best For |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| January | Cold | Low | $ | Winter trekking, festivals |\n| February | Cold | Low | $ | Winter trekking, festivals |\n| March | Mild | Med | $$ | Trekking, rafting, wildlife |\n| April | Warm | Med | $$ | Trekking, rafting, festivals |\n| May | Hot | Med | $$ | Trekking, rafting, festivals |\n| June | Hot | Low | $ | Wildlife, cultural tours |\n| July | Hot | Low | $ | Wildlife, cultural tours |\n| August | Hot | Low | $ | Wildlife, cultural tours |\n| September | Mild | Med | $$ | Trekking, rafting, festivals |\n| October | Mild | High | $$$ | Trekking, rafting, festivals |\n| November | Cool | High | $$$ | Trekking, rafting, festivals |\n| December | Cold | Low | $ | Winter trekking, festivals |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Festivals & Events Calendar [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Event | Month(s) | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Dashain** | September-October | A major Hindu festival, celebrated with parades, music, and dance |\n| **Tihar** | October-November | A five-day festival of lights, celebrating the triumph of good over evil |\n| **Buddha Jayanti** | May | A celebration of the birth of Buddha, marked with parades and ceremonies |\n| **Holi** | March | A festival of colors, celebrated with music, dance, and colored powders |\n| **Loi Krathong** | November | A festival of lights, celebrated with lanterns and floating candles |\n| **Maha Shivaratri** | February-March | A Hindu festival, celebrated with music, dance, and rituals |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Variations [/SECTION]\n- The **Terai** region in the south is hot and humid year-round, making it ideal for visiting during the winter months.\n- The **Hill** region, which includes Kathmandu and Pokhara, has a mild climate, making it ideal for visiting year-round.\n- The **Himalayan** region is cold and dry, making it ideal for visiting during the spring and autumn seasons.\n- The **Langtang** region is a popular trekking destination, with the best time to visit being from September to November and March to May.\n- The **Everest** region is a popular trekking destination, with the best time to visit being from September to November and March to May, but be prepared for extreme cold and altitude sickness.\n\n[SECTION] Practical Tips [/SECTION]\n- Book your accommodations and tours well in advance, especially during peak season, to avoid high prices and availability issues.\n- Consider visiting during the shoulder season, which offers lower prices and smaller crowds.\n- Pack warm clothing for the winter months, and rain gear for the monsoon season.\n- Be prepared for potential power outages and water shortages, especially during the monsoon season.\n- Respect local customs and traditions, especially during festivals and ceremonies.\n- Consider hiring a guide or joining a tour group, especially if you're planning to trek or visit remote areas.",
