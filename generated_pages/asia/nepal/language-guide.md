[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]
Nepal has a diverse linguistic landscape, with over 100 languages spoken across the country. **Nepali** is the most widely spoken language and is used as the primary means of communication in government, education, and media. However, there are many regional dialects and minority languages spoken in different parts of the country, including **Tharu**, **Tamang**, and **Newari**. English is also widely spoken, particularly in tourist areas and among the educated population, but proficiency levels can vary greatly. In general, English is more widely understood in urban areas such as **Kathmandu** and **Pokhara**, while in rural areas, **Nepali** and local dialects are more commonly spoken.

The country's linguistic diversity is also reflected in the many languages spoken by different ethnic groups. For example, the **Sherpa** people, who are known for their mountaineering skills, speak a language called **Sherpa**, which is also known as **Solukhumbu**. Similarly, the **Gurung** people, who are known for their traditional clothing and music, speak a language called **Gurung**, which is also known as **Tamang**. Overall, Nepal's linguistic landscape is complex and diverse, reflecting the country's rich cultural heritage.

Despite the many languages spoken in Nepal, **Nepali** is the language that is most widely understood and used as a **lingua franca**. It is the language of government, education, and media, and is widely used in business and commerce. As a result, visitors to Nepal can get by with just **Nepali** and English, although learning a few words of the local dialects can go a long way in terms of building relationships with the local people.
