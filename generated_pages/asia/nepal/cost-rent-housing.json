Typical lease terms in Nepal are for one to three years, with a security deposit of one to two months' rent required. Tenant rights are generally protected under the Nepal Rent Act, which regulates rent increases and eviction procedures. Compared to its regional neighbors, Nepal's housing costs are relatively low, making it an attractive option for expats and tourists. However, the country's housing market is also subject to fluctuations in the economy and infrastructure development, which can impact rental prices and availability.\n\nThe housing market in Nepal is also influenced by the country's geography, with the capital city Kathmandu being the most populous and expensive region. The city's housing market is characterized by a mix of traditional and modern apartments, with many options available in the city center and surrounding neighborhoods. Outside of Kathmandu, rental prices are generally lower, with more affordable options available in smaller towns and rural areas. Nepal's housing costs are generally lower than those in neighboring countries such as China and India, making it a popular destination for expats and tourists looking for affordable accommodation.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $150-$250 | $100-$200 | basic amenities, shared kitchen and bathroom |\n| 1 Bedroom | $200-$350 | $150-$300 | furnished, private kitchen and bathroom |\n| 2 Bedroom | $300-$500 | $250-$450 | family size, amenities like TV and fridge |\n| 3 Bedroom | $450-$700 | $400-$650 | spacious, modern amenities like air conditioning |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $1,500-$2,500 | prime locations, modern amenities |\n| Suburbs | $1,000-$2,000 | residential areas, basic amenities |\n| Rural | $500-$1,000 | agricultural land, limited amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- Thamel: $200-$500 per month, known for its tourist-friendly atmosphere and amenities\n- Lazimpat: $300-$600 per month, upscale neighborhood with modern apartments and amenities\n- Bhaktapur: $150-$300 per month, historic neighborhood with traditional architecture and culture\n- Pokhara: $100-$250 per month, lakeside town with stunning natural beauty and outdoor activities\n- Patan: $200-$400 per month, cultural hub with historic landmarks and traditional crafts\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Nepal [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods and prices before starting your housing search\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent or landlord to avoid scams\n- Negotiate the rent and amenities to get the best deal\n- Check the condition and amenities of the apartment before signing a lease\n- Be prepared to pay a security deposit and one to two months' rent upfront\n- Consider hiring a local guide or expat service to help with the housing search and paperwork",
