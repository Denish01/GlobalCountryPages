[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Nepal is structured into three main levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Primary education, which is compulsory for all children between the ages of 5 and 12, is provided by government-run schools as well as private institutions. Secondary education, which is also compulsory, is divided into two stages: lower secondary (ages 13-15) and upper secondary (ages 16-18). Tertiary education, which includes universities and colleges, offers a range of academic and professional programs. The quality of education in Nepal varies, with public schools often struggling with limited resources and infrastructure, while private schools tend to offer better facilities and instruction. However, recent reforms have aimed to improve the overall quality of education, with a focus on increasing access and equity.

The public education system in Nepal is free and compulsory for all children, but the quality of education can be inconsistent, with some schools lacking basic facilities such as classrooms, libraries, and toilets. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a range of programs and curricula, including **International Baccalaureate** and **Cambridge International Examinations**, but can be expensive and out of reach for many families. Despite these challenges, Nepal has made significant progress in increasing access to education, with the number of children enrolled in school increasing significantly in recent years.

Overall, the education system in Nepal is complex and multifaceted, with both public and private institutions playing important roles. While there are challenges to be addressed, including issues of quality and equity, the system offers a range of opportunities for students to pursue their academic and professional goals. The government has also introduced various initiatives to improve the education system, including the introduction of new curricula and teacher training programs.
