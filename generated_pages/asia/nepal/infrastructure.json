  "content": "Nepal's infrastructure is still developing, with significant gaps in rural areas, but recent investments have improved the overall situation, particularly in the transportation and energy sectors.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 91% of population\nInternet Penetration: 34%\nRoad Network: 17,282 km, with 40% paved\nRail Network: none\nMajor Airports: 3\nMajor Ports: none, landlocked\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nNepal's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other countries in the region, but it has made significant progress in recent years. The government has invested heavily in the development of roads, bridges, and hydropower plants, with a focus on improving connectivity and energy security. However, there is still a significant gap between urban and rural areas, with many rural communities lacking access to basic services such as electricity, clean water, and sanitation. The country's rugged terrain and limited resources have also hindered the development of its infrastructure, but efforts to improve the situation are ongoing.\n\nNepal's infrastructure has been impacted by natural disasters such as earthquakes and floods, which have damaged or destroyed critical infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and power transmission lines. However, the government has made significant efforts to rebuild and upgrade its infrastructure, with a focus on making it more resilient to natural disasters. Recent investments in the energy sector, for example, have improved the reliability of the power supply and reduced the frequency of outages.\n\nDespite these challenges, Nepal's infrastructure has the potential to support the country's economic growth and development. The government has identified infrastructure development as a key priority, and has established a number of initiatives and programs to support the development of its roads, energy, and water sectors. With continued investment and support, Nepal's infrastructure is likely to continue to improve, providing a stronger foundation for the country's economic and social development.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 17,282 km | Moderate | 40% paved, with many rural roads in poor condition |\n| Railways | none | - | No rail network, but plans to develop a rail link with India |\n| Airports | 3 international, 14 domestic | Good | Major airports at Kathmandu, Biratnagar, and Pokhara |\n| Ports | none | - | Landlocked, but with access to Indian ports via road and rail |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- **Hydropower** is the main source of electricity generation in Nepal, with a total installed capacity of over 1,000 MW.\n- The country has made significant progress in increasing access to electricity, with over 90% of the population now having access to power.\n- However, the power supply is not always reliable, and outages are common, particularly during periods of high demand.\n- Nepal has set a target of generating 10,000 MW of electricity by 2025, with a focus on developing its hydropower resources.\n- The government has also launched initiatives to promote the use of **renewable energy**, including solar and wind power, in order to reduce the country's dependence on fossil fuels.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- Access to **clean water** is a significant challenge in Nepal, particularly in rural areas, where many communities rely on traditional wells and springs.\n- The country has made progress in improving access to sanitation, with over 80% of the population now having access to basic sanitation facilities.\n- However, the quality of sanitation facilities is often poor, and many communities lack access to **wastewater treatment** facilities.\n- The government has launched initiatives to improve access to clean water and sanitation, including the development of new water supply systems and sanitation facilities.\n- **Tap water safety** is also a concern in Nepal, with many communities lacking access to safe and reliable drinking water.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is widespread in Nepal, with over 90% of the population having access to mobile phone services.\n- The country has made significant progress in developing its **fiber optic network**, with a number of major cities now connected to high-speed internet services.\n- **4G services** are available in many parts of the country, with a number of operators offering high-speed mobile internet services.\n- The government has launched initiatives to promote the use of **information and communication technology** (ICT) in Nepal, including the development of e-government services and online platforms for businesses and individuals.\n- **Postal services** are also available in Nepal, with a number of post offices and mail delivery services operating throughout the country.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The **Kathmandu-Tarai Fast Track** project is a major infrastructure development project that aims to improve connectivity between Kathmandu and the Tarai region.\n- The **Upper Tamakoshi Hydropower Project** is a major energy development project that aims to generate over 400 MW of electricity.\n- The **Nepal-India Rail Link** project aims to develop a rail link between Nepal and India, with a number of feasibility studies and planning exercises currently underway.\n- The **Kathmandu Valley Water Supply Project** aims to improve access to clean water in the Kathmandu Valley, with a number of new water supply systems and sanitation facilities being developed.\n- The **Nepal Telecommunications Project** aims to improve access to telecommunications services in Nepal, with a number of initiatives to develop the country's fiber optic network and mobile phone services.",
