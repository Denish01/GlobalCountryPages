The country's economy has been steadily growing over the past few decades, with a GDP growth rate of around 6-7% per annum.

The industrial sector, including manufacturing and construction, accounts for around 20% of GDP, while agriculture accounts for around 30%. The country's economy is also heavily reliant on remittances from Nepali workers abroad, which accounts for around 25% of GDP.
