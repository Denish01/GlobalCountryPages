        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Nepal has a rich and diverse history that spans over two thousand years. The country's strategic location in the Himalayas has made it a significant cultural and trade hub between <strong>India</strong> and <strong>China</strong>. The recorded history of Nepal began with the <strong>Shakya</strong> dynasty in the 6th century BC, which is said to be the birthplace of <strong>Buddha</strong>. The country was later ruled by the <strong>Lichhavi</strong> dynasty, followed by the <strong>Malla</strong> dynasty, which split into three kingdoms: <strong>Kantipur</strong>, <strong>Lalitpur</strong>, and <strong>Bhaktapur</strong>. In 1768, the <strong>Shah</strong> dynasty unified the three kingdoms and established the Kingdom of Nepal. Nepal remained an independent kingdom until it became a <strong>federal democratic republic</strong> in 2008.</p>
        <p>Nepal's independence was never formally colonized by any European power, but it was heavily influenced by <strong>British India</strong>. The country signed the <strong>Treaty of Betrawati</strong> with British India in 1816, which established Nepal as a <strong>protectorate</strong> of British India. This treaty allowed Nepal to maintain its internal autonomy while ceding control over its foreign affairs to British India. Nepal's relationship with British India remained complex, with the country playing a significant role in the <strong>Anglo-Nepal War</strong> of 1814-1816.</p>
        <p>The 20th century saw significant changes in Nepal's political landscape. In 1951, the <strong>Rana</strong> regime, which had ruled the country since 1846, was overthrown, and a new <strong>constitution</strong> was established. However, the country's political stability was short-lived, and Nepal experienced a period of <strong>monarchy</strong> and <strong>authoritarian rule</strong>. In 2006, a <strong>peace agreement</strong> was signed, ending a decade-long <strong>civil war</strong> between the government and the <strong>Maoist</strong> rebels.</p>
        <p>Nepal's transition to a <strong>federal democratic republic</strong> in 2008 marked a significant turning point in the country's history. The new <strong>constitution</strong>, adopted in 2015, established Nepal as a <strong>secular</strong> and <strong>federal</strong> state, with a <strong>president</strong> serving as the head of state and a <strong>prime minister</strong> as the head of government. Today, Nepal continues to navigate its complex political landscape, balancing its relationships with its neighbors and the international community.</p>
        <h2>Common Misconceptions</h2>
        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "Nepal is a small, landlocked country with limited economic opportunities."</p>
        <p>Reality: While Nepal is indeed a landlocked country, it has a diverse economy with significant opportunities in <strong>agriculture</strong>, <strong>tourism</strong>, and <strong>hydroelectric power</strong>.

        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "Nepal is a predominantly Hindu country with limited cultural diversity."</p>
        <p>Reality: While <strong>Hinduism</strong> is the dominant religion in Nepal, the country is home to a significant <strong>Buddhist</strong> population, as well as smaller communities of <strong>Muslims</strong>, <strong>Christians</strong>, and <strong>animists</strong>. Nepal's cultural diversity is reflected in its many <strong>festivals</strong> and <strong>celebrations</strong>, which showcase the country's rich cultural heritage. [/CALLOOUT]</p>
        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "Nepal is a dangerous country with high crime rates."</p>
        <p>Reality: While Nepal, like any other country, has its share of <strong>crime</strong> and <strong>safety concerns</strong>, the overall crime rate is relatively low. Visitors to Nepal are generally safe, and the country has a reputation for being a <strong>welcoming</strong> and <strong>hospitable</strong> destination. [/CALLOUT]</p>
        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "Nepal is a poor country with limited access to education and healthcare."</p>
        <p>Reality: While Nepal is a <strong>developing country</strong> with significant challenges in <strong>poverty</strong> and <strong>inequality</strong>, the country has made significant progress in <strong>education</strong> and <strong>healthcare</strong> in recent years. Nepal has a <strong>literacy rate</strong> of over 70%, and the country has implemented various programs to improve <strong>healthcare access</strong> and <strong>quality</strong>. [/CALLOUT]</p>
        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "Nepal is a country with limited infrastructure and transportation options."</p>
        <p>Reality: While Nepal's <strong>infrastructure</strong> and <strong>transportation</strong> networks are still developing, the country has made significant investments in <strong>roads</strong>, <strong>airports</strong>, and <strong>telecommunications</strong> in recent years. Nepal is also home to a number of <strong>international airports</strong>, including the <strong>Tribhuvan International Airport</strong> in <strong>Kathmandu</strong>. [/CALLOUT]</p>

        <li>The country's <strong>healthcare system</strong> is under-resourced, with significant shortages in <strong>medical personnel</strong> and <strong>equipment</strong>.</li>
        <li>Nepal's <strong>economy</strong> is heavily dependent on <strong>remittances</strong> from <strong>overseas workers</strong>, which can make the country vulnerable to <strong>economic shocks</strong>.</li>
