However, as with any travel destination, there are certain risks and precautions that visitors should be aware of. The country has a strong focus on tourism, and the government has taken steps to improve safety and security for visitors. The majority of crimes against tourists are petty, such as pickpocketing or scams, and violent crime is relatively rare.
