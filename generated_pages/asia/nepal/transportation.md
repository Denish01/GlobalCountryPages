[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Nepal is easily accessible by air, with Tribhuvan International Airport (KTM) in Kathmandu being the main entry point for international travelers. The airport is well-connected to major hubs in Asia, Europe, and the Middle East, with direct flights available from cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, Bangkok, and Dubai. Additionally, Nepal can be reached overland from India and China, with several border crossings open to foreigners, including the popular Birgunj-Raxaul crossing from India.

For those traveling overland, there are several bus and taxi services available from the border towns to major cities in Nepal, including Kathmandu, Pokhara, and Chitwan. The journey can be long and arduous, but it offers a unique glimpse into the country's rural landscapes and cultures. It's also possible to hire a private vehicle or join a guided tour to make the journey more comfortable and convenient.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Nepal has an extensive domestic air network, with several airlines operating flights to major towns and cities, including Buddha Air, Yeti Airlines, and Shree Airlines. The main routes connect Kathmandu to popular tourist destinations such as Pokhara, Lukla, and Bharatpur, with frequent flights available throughout the day. Booking in advance is recommended, especially during peak travel seasons, and approximate costs range from $50 to $200 for a one-way ticket, depending on the route and airline. It's also worth noting that domestic flights can be affected by weather conditions, especially in the mountains, so it's essential to check the latest flight schedules and weather forecasts before traveling.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Nepal's rail network is limited, with only a few routes operating in the southern part of the country, near the border with India. The most notable route connects Jaynagar in India to Bijalpura in Nepal, with a journey time of around 6 hours. However, the train service is not well-developed, and journeys can be slow and uncomfortable. There are no high-speed rail options available in Nepal, and the booking process can be complicated, with limited online resources and English language support.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Nepal has an extensive network of buses and coaches, connecting major towns and cities, including tourist destinations such as Pokhara, Chitwan, and Lumbini. The bus services are generally affordable, with costs ranging from $5 to $20 for a one-way ticket, depending on the route and quality of service. However, the journey can be long and arduous, especially on the country's poor roads, and the buses can be crowded and uncomfortable. Several bus companies operate in Nepal, including the government-run Sajha Yatayat and private operators such as Greenline and Golden Bus, offering a range of services from basic to deluxe.
