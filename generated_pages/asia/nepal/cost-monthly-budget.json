The GDP per capita (PPP) of $5,737 provides a good anchor for estimating living costs. A budget of $400-700 per month can provide a decent lifestyle, while $700-1,200 per month can offer a more comfortable lifestyle with some luxuries. In comparison, Nepal is significantly cheaper than China, but slightly more expensive than India. The cost of living in Nepal can vary greatly depending on the lifestyle and location, with cities like Kathmandu and Pokhara being more expensive than smaller towns and rural areas.\n\nThe affordability of Nepal is also influenced by the inflation rate of 4.7%, which is relatively high compared to other countries in the region. However, the low cost of living and the relatively stable economy make Nepal an attractive destination for digital nomads, retirees, and students. The country also offers a unique cultural experience, with a rich history and natural beauty, making it an attractive destination for tourists and expats. With a little planning and research, it is possible to live a comfortable life in Nepal on a moderate budget.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Breakdown [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Category | Budget ($) | Mid-Range ($) | Comfortable ($) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rent (1BR apartment) | 100-200 | 200-400 | 400-600 | (budget=shared/outside, mid=1BR center, comfortable=nice 2BR) |\n| Food & Groceries | 100-200 | 200-300 | 300-500 | (budget=cook mostly, mid=mix, comfortable=eat out often) |\n| Transportation | 20-50 | 50-100 | 100-200 | (budget=public only, mid=mix, comfortable=taxi/car) |\n| Utilities & Internet | 30-50 | 50-100 | 100-150 | (electricity, water, internet, phone) |\n| Healthcare / Insurance | 20-50 | 50-100 | 100-200 | (budget=public only, comfortable=private) |\n| Entertainment & Social | 50-100 | 100-200 | 200-300 | (going out, hobbies, gym) |\n| Clothing & Personal | 20-50 | 50-100 | 100-200 | |\n| Savings / Misc | 50-100 | 100-200 | 200-300 | |\n| **Total** | **440-700** | **800-1,400** | **1,400-2,200** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Budget Tier Lifestyles [/SECTION]\nA budget lifestyle in Nepal can provide a decent standard of living, with a shared apartment outside of the city center, cooking most meals, and using public transportation.
