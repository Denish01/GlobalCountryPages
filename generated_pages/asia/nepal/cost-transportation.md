[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Nepal's transportation network is primarily composed of buses, taxis, and rickshaws, with most people relying on these modes to get around. The quality of public transit varies greatly between cities, with Kathmandu having a more comprehensive network compared to other cities. However, the roads can be congested, and traffic can be a major issue, especially during peak hours. Many locals also rely on walking or cycling as a mode of transportation, especially for shorter distances.

The main transportation modes in Nepal include buses, which are the most affordable option, and taxis, which are more convenient but also more expensive. Rickshaws are also a popular mode of transportation, especially for shorter distances. The government has also introduced initiatives to improve the public transportation system, including the introduction of new bus routes and the development of a metro system in Kathmandu. However, the progress has been slow, and the transportation network still faces many challenges, including congestion and pollution.
