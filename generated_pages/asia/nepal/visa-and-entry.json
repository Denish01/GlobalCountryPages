The country aims to promote tourism and facilitate travel for visitors from around the world. Citizens from certain countries, including India, do not require a visa to enter Nepal. However, it is essential to note that visa requirements can change, and it is always best to check with the official embassy or consulate of Nepal for the most up-to-date information.\n\nNepal offers various types of visas, including tourist, business, student, and work visas. The country has also introduced an online visa application system, making it easier for travelers to apply for their visas in advance. With its rich cultural heritage, stunning natural beauty, and friendly people, Nepal is a popular destination for tourists, trekkers, and adventure seekers.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | On Arrival | Tourist | 150 days | Can be extended |\n| UK Citizens | On Arrival | Tourist | 150 days | Can be extended |\n| EU Citizens | On Arrival | Tourist | 150 days | Can be extended |\n| Canadian Citizens | On Arrival | Tourist | 150 days | Can be extended |\n| Australian Citizens | On Arrival | Tourist | 150 days | Can be extended |\n| Indian Citizens | No | - | - | Do not require a visa |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Tourist | 30 days | Must apply in advance |\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can obtain a visa-on-arrival at Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu or at various land border crossings. The typical stay for tourists is 15, 30, or 90 days, depending on the type of visa. Extensions are possible, but must be applied for at the Department of Immigration in Kathmandu. **Business Travelers:** Business travelers must apply for a business visa, which requires an invitation letter from a Nepalese company or organization. The application process can take several days, and the visa is usually valid for a shorter period than a tourist visa. **Students:** Students must apply for a student visa, which requires proof of enrollment at a Nepalese educational institution. The visa is usually valid for the duration of the course, and students must register with the Department of Immigration within seven days of arrival. **Workers:** Workers must apply for a work visa, which requires sponsorship from a Nepalese employer. The application process can take several weeks, and the visa is usually valid for a specific period.\n\n[SECTION] Documents Checklist [/SECTION]\n1.
