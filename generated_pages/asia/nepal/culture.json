The country is situated in the Himalayas, bordering China to the north and India to the south, east, and west, making it a unique cultural crossroads. Nepali culture is defined by its **Hindu** and **Buddhist** traditions, with a significant influence from **Tibetan** culture in the north. The country is home to over 100 ethnic groups, each with their own language, customs, and traditions. The largest ethnic groups include the **Chhetri**, **Brahmin**, **Tharu**, and **Tamang**.\n\nThe cultural identity of Nepal is also shaped by its history, with the country being a kingdom for over 1,500 years. The **Malla** and **Shah** dynasties played a significant role in shaping the country's culture, architecture, and art. The influence of **Indian** and **Tibetan** cultures is evident in Nepal's cuisine, festivals, and traditions. The country's unique cultural heritage is reflected in its vibrant cities, historic temples, and bustling markets. The **Nepali** language, which is the official language, is spoken by the majority of the population, although many other languages are also spoken, including **Maithili**, **Bhojpuri**, and **Tharu**.\n\nNepal's cultural diversity is also reflected in its **caste system**, which is still prevalent in many parts of the country. The system is based on the principles of **Hinduism**, with different castes having different roles and responsibilities.

Despite this, the Nepali people are known for their warm hospitality and welcoming nature, making visitors feel at home.\n\n[SECTION] Food & Cuisine [/SECTION]\n| Dish | Type | Description | Must-Try? |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Dal Bhat | Main Course | Lentil soup served with rice and vegetables | Yes |\n| Momo | Snack | Steamed dumplings filled with meat or vegetables | Yes |\n| Gorkhali Lamb | Main Course | Lamb curry made with spices and herbs | Yes |\n| Thukpa | Noodle Soup | Tibetan-style noodle soup made with vegetables and meat | Yes |\n| Sel Roti | Dessert | Sweet, deep-fried doughnut made from rice flour | Yes |\n| Yomari | Dessert | Sweet, steamed dumpling made from rice flour and filled with sesame seeds | Yes |\n| Lassi | Drink | Yogurt-based drink made with spices and herbs | Yes |\n| Chhaang | Drink | Traditional Nepali beer made from rice or millet | No |\n\nEating customs in Nepal are an important part of the culture, with **Dal Bhat** being the staple food.
