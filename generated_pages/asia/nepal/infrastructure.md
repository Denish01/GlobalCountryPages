[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 91% of population
Internet Penetration: 34%
Road Network: 17,282 km, with 40% paved
Rail Network: none
Major Airports: 3
Major Ports: none, landlocked
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Nepal's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other countries in the region, but it has made significant progress in recent years. The government has invested heavily in the development of roads, bridges, and hydropower plants, with a focus on improving connectivity and energy security. However, there is still a significant gap between urban and rural areas, with many rural communities lacking access to basic services such as electricity, clean water, and sanitation. The country's rugged terrain and limited resources have also hindered the development of its infrastructure, but efforts to improve the situation are ongoing.

Nepal's infrastructure has been impacted by natural disasters such as earthquakes and floods, which have damaged or destroyed critical infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and power transmission lines. However, the government has made significant efforts to rebuild and upgrade its infrastructure, with a focus on making it more resilient to natural disasters. Recent investments in the energy sector, for example, have improved the reliability of the power supply and reduced the frequency of outages.

Despite these challenges, Nepal's infrastructure has the potential to support the country's economic growth and development. The government has identified infrastructure development as a key priority, and has established a number of initiatives and programs to support the development of its roads, energy, and water sectors. With continued investment and support, Nepal's infrastructure is likely to continue to improve, providing a stronger foundation for the country's economic and social development.
