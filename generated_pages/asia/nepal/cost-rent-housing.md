[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Nepal's rental market is relatively affordable, with a wide range of options available for expats and locals alike. Typical lease terms in Nepal are for one to three years, with a security deposit of one to two months' rent required. Tenant rights are generally protected under the Nepal Rent Act, which regulates rent increases and eviction procedures. Compared to its regional neighbors, Nepal's housing costs are relatively low, making it an attractive option for expats and tourists. However, the country's housing market is also subject to fluctuations in the economy and infrastructure development, which can impact rental prices and availability.

The housing market in Nepal is also influenced by the country's geography, with the capital city Kathmandu being the most populous and expensive region. The city's housing market is characterized by a mix of traditional and modern apartments, with many options available in the city center and surrounding neighborhoods. Outside of Kathmandu, rental prices are generally lower, with more affordable options available in smaller towns and rural areas. Nepal's housing costs are generally lower than those in neighboring countries such as China and India, making it a popular destination for expats and tourists looking for affordable accommodation.
