[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Kuwait's rental market is highly competitive, with a high demand for apartments and villas, particularly in the city center. Typical lease terms range from 1 to 2 years, with a security deposit of 1-2 months' rent required. Tenant rights are protected by law, but it is essential to have a written contract and understand the terms and conditions before signing. Compared to its regional neighbors, Kuwait's housing costs are relatively high, with prices similar to those in Saudi Arabia but higher than in Iraq.

The Kuwaiti government has implemented various measures to regulate the housing market and protect tenants, including rent control laws and tenant protection agencies. However, the market remains highly competitive, and tenants may face challenges in finding affordable and suitable housing. Expats and foreigners may also face additional challenges, such as language barriers and cultural differences, when navigating the housing market in Kuwait.
