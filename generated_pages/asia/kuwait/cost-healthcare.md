[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Kuwait has a mixed healthcare system, with both public and private providers offering a range of services to locals and foreigners. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of high quality and is free or low-cost for Kuwaiti citizens, while private healthcare providers offer more specialized and luxurious services at a higher cost. For foreigners, it's recommended to have health insurance, as public healthcare services may not be available to them. The healthcare system in Kuwait is well-organized, with many hospitals and medical centers equipped with modern technology and staffed by qualified medical professionals.

The public healthcare system in Kuwait is managed by the Ministry of Health, which operates a network of hospitals, clinics, and health centers throughout the country. These facilities provide a range of services, including emergency care, outpatient services, and inpatient care. Private healthcare providers, on the other hand, offer more specialized services, such as cosmetic surgery, fertility treatment, and advanced diagnostic testing. Many private hospitals and clinics in Kuwait are accredited by international organizations, such as the Joint Commission International, and offer high-quality care to patients.
