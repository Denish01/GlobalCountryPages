The country's economic classification is that of a petroleum-based economy, with oil and gas accounting for nearly half of its GDP. Kuwait's development level is considered advanced, with a strong focus on diversification and economic development. The country's economy has been on a trajectory of steady growth, with a focus on reducing its dependence on oil exports.
