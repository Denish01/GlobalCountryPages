Peak season: December, January, and February. Budget season: November and March. Avoid: June, July, and August due to extremely high temperatures and humidity. [/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]\nKuwait has a **desert climate**, characterized by very hot summers and mild winters. The country experiences two main seasons: a **dry season** from April to October, and a **wet season** from November to March. During the dry season, the weather is extremely hot, with temperatures often reaching 50°C (122°F) in the summer months. In contrast, the wet season is mild and pleasant, with average temperatures ranging from 10°C to 20°C (50°F to 68°F). The seasons have a significant impact on travel, as the hot summer months can make outdoor activities uncomfortable, while the mild winter months are ideal for sightseeing and exploring the country.\n\nThe **dry season** is further divided into two sub-seasons: a **hot season** from April to June, and a **very hot season** from July to October. During the hot season, temperatures are extremely high, and the humidity is also high, making it uncomfortable for outdoor activities. The very hot season is even hotter, with temperatures often reaching record highs. In contrast, the **wet season** is characterized by mild temperatures and occasional rainfall, making it an ideal time to visit Kuwait.\n\nThe seasons also affect the **crowd levels** in Kuwait. During the peak season, which coincides with the winter months, tourist attractions and popular destinations are crowded, and prices for accommodations and tourist services are higher. In contrast, during the budget season, which includes the months of November and March, crowd levels are lower, and prices are more affordable.\n\n[SECTION] Month-by-Month Guide [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Month | Weather | Crowds | Prices | Best For |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| January | Mild, 10-20°C (50-68°F) | Low | $ | Sightseeing, outdoor activities |\n| February | Mild, 10-20°C (50-68°F) | Low | $ | Sightseeing, outdoor activities |\n| March | Mild, 15-25°C (59-77°F) | Low | $ | Sightseeing, outdoor activities |\n| April | Hot, 20-30°C (68-86°F) | Medium | $$ | Shopping, indoor activities |\n| May | Hot, 25-35°C (77-95°F) | Medium | $$ | Shopping, indoor activities |\n| June | Very hot, 30-40°C (86-104°F) | High | $$$ | Indoor activities, water parks |\n| July | Very hot, 35-45°C (95-113°F) | High | $$$ | Indoor activities, water parks |\n| August | Very hot, 35-45°C (95-113°F) | High | $$$ | Indoor activities, water parks |\n| September | Hot, 25-35°C (77-95°F) | Medium | $$ | Shopping, indoor activities |\n| October | Hot, 20-30°C (68-86°F) | Medium | $$ | Shopping, indoor activities |\n| November | Mild, 15-25°C (59-77°F) | Low | $ | Sightseeing, outdoor activities |\n| December | Mild, 10-20°C (50-68°F) | Low | $ | Sightseeing, outdoor activities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Festivals & Events Calendar [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Event | Month(s) | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| National Day | February | Celebrates Kuwait's independence from Britain |\n| Liberation Day | February | Commemorates the liberation of Kuwait from Iraqi occupation |\n| Ramadan | Variable | A month of fasting and spiritual reflection for Muslims |\n| Eid al-Fitr | Variable | A celebration marking the end of Ramadan |\n| Eid al-Adha | Variable | A celebration marking the willingness of the Prophet Ibrahim to sacrifice his son |\n| Hala February Festival | February | A cultural and entertainment festival featuring music, dance, and theater performances |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Variations [/SECTION]\n- The **coastal regions** of Kuwait tend to be cooler than the inland areas, especially during the summer months.\n- The **desert regions** are extremely hot during the summer months and can be challenging to visit during this time.\n- The **northern regions** of Kuwait tend to be cooler than the southern regions, especially during the winter months.\n- The **Kuwait City** area is generally more crowded and expensive than other regions of the country.\n- The **beach resorts** along the coast of Kuwait are popular during the winter months, especially among locals and expatriates.\n\n[SECTION] Practical Tips [/SECTION]\n- Book your accommodations and tourist services well in advance, especially during the peak season.\n- Consider visiting during the shoulder season, which includes the months of November and March, for lower prices and smaller crowds.\n- Pack **lightweight and breathable clothing** for the hot summer months, and **warm clothing** for the mild winter months.\n- Avoid visiting during the **holidays and festivals**, as prices tend to be higher and crowds are larger.\n- Stay **hydrated** and take regular breaks in the shade or air-conditioned spaces to avoid heat exhaustion during the summer months.\n- Respect **local customs and traditions**, especially during the month of Ramadan, by dressing modestly and avoiding public eating and drinking during the day.",
