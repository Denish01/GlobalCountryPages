[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Kuwait has a high-income economy, driven primarily by its vast oil reserves. The country's economic classification is that of a petroleum-based economy, with oil and gas accounting for nearly half of its GDP. Kuwait's development level is considered advanced, with a strong focus on diversification and economic development. The country's economy has been on a trajectory of steady growth, with a focus on reducing its dependence on oil exports. Kuwait's economic vision, known as the "New Kuwait 2035" plan, aims to transform the country into a financial and commercial hub, with a diversified economy and a high standard of living.

Kuwait's economy is characterized by a high level of government involvement, with the state playing a significant role in key sectors such as oil and gas, finance, and construction. The country's economic growth has been driven by large-scale infrastructure projects, including the development of new oil fields, power plants, and transportation networks. Kuwait's strategic location at the head of the Persian Gulf makes it an important hub for trade and commerce in the region.

Despite its many strengths, Kuwait's economy faces several challenges, including a lack of diversification and a high dependence on oil exports. The country is also vulnerable to fluctuations in global oil prices, which can have a significant impact on its economy. To address these challenges, the Kuwaiti government has implemented a range of policies aimed at promoting economic diversification and reducing the country's reliance on oil exports.
