[/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nKuwait has a moderate visa policy, with a mix of visa-free access, visa on arrival, and required visas for different nationalities. Citizens of certain countries, such as those from the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), can enter Kuwait without a visa, while others may need to apply for a visa in advance or obtain one upon arrival. The country is becoming increasingly popular with tourists, and the government has introduced various visa types to cater to different visitor needs.\n\nKuwait's visa policy is designed to balance the need to attract foreign visitors and investors with the need to maintain national security and control over immigration. The country has a relatively strict visa stance compared to some of its neighbors, but it is still possible for visitors to obtain a visa with the right documentation and qualifications. Currently, citizens of around 50 countries can enter Kuwait without a visa, while others may need to apply for a visa in advance or obtain one upon arrival.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | No | Visa on Arrival | 90 days | Can be extended for an additional 90 days |\n| UK Citizens | No | Visa on Arrival | 90 days | Can be extended for an additional 90 days |\n| EU Citizens | No | Visa on Arrival | 90 days | Can be extended for an additional 90 days |\n| Canadian Citizens | No | Visa on Arrival | 90 days | Can be extended for an additional 90 days |\n| Australian Citizens | No | Visa on Arrival | 90 days | Can be extended for an additional 90 days |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | eVisa | 30 days | Must apply online in advance |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | eVisa | 30 days | Must apply online in advance |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can typically stay in Kuwait for up to 90 days, and can apply for a visa on arrival.

When arriving in Kuwait, visitors will need to go through immigration and customs, where they will need to present their passport and visa (if required).
