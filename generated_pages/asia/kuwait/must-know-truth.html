        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Kuwait has a rich and diverse history that dates back to ancient times. The area that is now Kuwait was first inhabited by the <strong>Dilmun civilization</strong> in the 3rd millennium BC. The Dilmun civilization was a major trading center, with trade links to ancient Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley. In the 18th century, Kuwait was founded as a small fishing village by the <strong>Al-Sabah family</strong>, who still rule the country today. In 1899, Kuwait became a <strong>British protectorate</strong>, with the British providing military protection in exchange for control over Kuwait's foreign affairs. This arrangement lasted until 1961, when Kuwait gained its <strong>independence</strong> from Britain.</p>
        <p>Kuwait's early years as an independent nation were marked by a series of challenges, including a dispute with Iraq over the country's borders. In 1961, Iraq claimed Kuwait as its own territory, but the dispute was eventually resolved with the help of the <strong>Arab League</strong> and the <strong>United Nations</strong>. Kuwait's economy grew rapidly in the 1960s and 1970s, driven by the country's large <strong>oil reserves</strong>. Today, Kuwait is a <strong>sovereign state</strong> with a <strong>constitutional monarchy</strong> and a <strong>parliamentary system</strong> of government.</p>
        <p>Kuwait's history has been shaped by its strategic location at the head of the <strong>Persian Gulf</strong>. The country has been an important center for trade and commerce for centuries, and its <strong>port city</strong> has been a major hub for shipping and commerce. In 1990, Kuwait was invaded by Iraq, leading to the <strong>Gulf War</strong>. The war was fought between a coalition of countries led by the <strong>United States</strong> and Iraq, and it ended with the liberation of Kuwait in 1991.</p>
        <p>Kuwait's history is also marked by its cultural and social developments. The country has a rich <strong>cultural heritage</strong>, with a strong emphasis on <strong>Arabic literature</strong> and <strong>Islamic art</strong>. Kuwait's <strong>education system</strong> is highly developed, with a strong emphasis on <strong>science and technology</strong>. The country has also made significant progress in <strong>women's rights</strong>, with women playing an increasingly important role in Kuwaiti society.</p>
