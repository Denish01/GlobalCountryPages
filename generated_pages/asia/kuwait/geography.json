It is situated on the coast of the Persian Gulf, with a total coastline of approximately 499 kilometers. The country is bordered by two nations: Iraq to the north and west, and Saudi Arabia to the south and west. The Persian Gulf lies to the east, providing Kuwait with access to the sea and facilitating its important role in international trade.\n\nKuwait's strategic location has made it an important center for trade and commerce in the region. The country's borders with Iraq and Saudi Arabia are relatively short, with a total length of approximately 462 kilometers. The border with Iraq is about 240 kilometers long, while the border with Saudi Arabia is approximately 222 kilometers long. Kuwait's location in the Arabian Peninsula has also made it an important cultural and historical center, with many ancient archaeological sites and historical landmarks.\n\n[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]\nKuwait's terrain is generally flat, with a few low-lying hills and ridges. The country's highest point is the Mutla Ridge, which is approximately 306 meters above sea level. The terrain is mostly desert, with a few oases and coastal plains. The desert landscape is dominated by sand dunes, salt flats, and gravel plains. The coastal areas are generally flat and low-lying, with a few rocky headlands and small islands.\n\nThe country's landscape has been shaped by its arid climate and the movement of sand dunes. The desert terrain is home to a variety of unique geological features, including sandstone formations, limestone outcrops, and salt deposits. Kuwait's coastal areas are also home to a number of important wetlands, including mangrove forests, salt marshes, and mudflats. These wetlands provide important habitats for a variety of marine and bird life.\n\nKuwait's terrain has also been shaped by human activity, particularly the extraction of oil and gas. The country's oil fields are located in the north and west, and have been developed extensively over the past few decades. The oil industry has had a significant impact on Kuwait's landscape, with many oil rigs, pipelines, and other infrastructure visible across the country.\n\n[SECTION] Climate By Season [/SECTION]\n| Season | Months | Temperature Range | Rainfall | Conditions |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Winter | December to February | 10-20°C | 50-100 mm | Cool, dry |\n| Spring | March to May | 20-30°C | 10-50 mm | Mild, dry |\n| Summer | June to August | 35-45°C | 0-10 mm | Hot, dry |\n| Autumn | September to November | 25-35°C | 10-50 mm | Warm, dry |\n\n[SECTION] Best Time To Visit [/SECTION]\n[CALLOUT] Best months: October to April.
