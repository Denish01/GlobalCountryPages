[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Kuwait has a **desert climate**, characterized by very hot summers and mild winters. The country experiences two main seasons: a **dry season** from April to October, and a **wet season** from November to March. During the dry season, the weather is extremely hot, with temperatures often reaching 50°C (122°F) in the summer months. In contrast, the wet season is mild and pleasant, with average temperatures ranging from 10°C to 20°C (50°F to 68°F). The seasons have a significant impact on travel, as the hot summer months can make outdoor activities uncomfortable, while the mild winter months are ideal for sightseeing and exploring the country.

The **dry season** is further divided into two sub-seasons: a **hot season** from April to June, and a **very hot season** from July to October. During the hot season, temperatures are extremely high, and the humidity is also high, making it uncomfortable for outdoor activities. The very hot season is even hotter, with temperatures often reaching record highs. In contrast, the **wet season** is characterized by mild temperatures and occasional rainfall, making it an ideal time to visit Kuwait.

The seasons also affect the **crowd levels** in Kuwait. During the peak season, which coincides with the winter months, tourist attractions and popular destinations are crowded, and prices for accommodations and tourist services are higher. In contrast, during the budget season, which includes the months of November and March, crowd levels are lower, and prices are more affordable.
