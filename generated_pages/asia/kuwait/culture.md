# Kuwait Culture - Food, Traditions & Etiquette

[SECTION] Cultural Identity [/SECTION]
Kuwait's culture is defined by its rich history, Islamic traditions, and Bedouin heritage. The country's strategic location at the northern tip of the Persian Gulf has made it a crossroads for trade and cultural exchange, with key influences from Arabic, Islamic, and Middle Eastern customs. The ethnic and linguistic makeup of Kuwait is predominantly Arab, with the official language being Arabic. However, the country is also home to a significant expatriate population, with many residents hailing from other Middle Eastern countries, Asia, and beyond.

The Kuwaiti people take great pride in their cultural heritage, which is reflected in their traditional clothing, music, and customs. The **dishdasha**, a long white robe, is the traditional attire for men, while women wear the **abaya**, a black robe that covers the body. The country's Bedouin roots are also evident in its love of **horses**, **falcons**, and **desert camping**. Kuwaitis are known for their hospitality and welcoming nature, with visitors often being greeted with traditional Arabic coffee and dates.

Kuwait's cultural identity is also shaped by its Islamic traditions, with the majority of the population practicing **Islam**. The country's many mosques, including the famous **Grand Mosque**, are an integral part of the cultural landscape. The Islamic calendar and holidays, such as **Ramadan** and **Eid al-Fitr**, play a significant role in shaping the country's cultural and social rhythms.
