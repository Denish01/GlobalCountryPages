[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Kuwait has a well-developed transportation system, with a range of options available for getting around the city and beyond. The main modes of transportation in Kuwait are taxis, buses, and private cars, with many residents also using ride-hailing apps such as Uber and Careem. The quality of public transit in Kuwait is generally good, with a comprehensive network of buses and a growing metro system. However, traffic congestion can be a problem, particularly during peak hours.

Most people in Kuwait get around by car, with many residents owning their own vehicles. However, the use of public transportation is also common, particularly among expatriate workers and students. The government has invested heavily in improving the public transportation system in recent years, with the introduction of new bus routes and the development of a metro system. As a result, it is now possible to get around Kuwait without a car, although it may not always be the most convenient option.
