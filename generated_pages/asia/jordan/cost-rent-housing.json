Typical lease terms range from 6-12 months, with a security deposit equivalent to one or two months' rent required. Tenant rights are protected under Jordanian law, and renters are advised to carefully review their lease agreements before signing. Compared to its regional neighbors, Jordan's housing costs are relatively moderate, with prices lower than in Israel and Palestine, but higher than in Syria and Iraq. The country's housing market is also influenced by the presence of international organizations and expatriate communities, which can drive up demand and prices in certain areas.\n\nThe Jordanian government has implemented various initiatives to support the housing sector, including subsidies for low-income households and investments in affordable housing projects. However, the demand for housing, particularly in urban areas like Amman, remains high, and prices can be steep for those on a limited budget. Expats and foreigners may find that they need to budget more for housing in Jordan than they would in other countries in the region, but the overall cost of living remains relatively affordable. It's worth noting that the **inflation rate** in Jordan is relatively low, at 1.6%, which can help to keep housing costs stable over time.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $300-$500 | $200-$350 | small, basic amenities |\n| 1 Bedroom | $400-$700 | $250-$500 | medium size, standard amenities |\n| 2 Bedroom | $600-$1,000 | $400-$800 | large, modern amenities |\n| 3 Bedroom | $900-$1,500 | $600-$1,200 | spacious, luxury amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $1,500-$3,000 | prime locations, modern buildings |\n| Suburbs | $1,000-$2,000 | residential areas, family-friendly |\n| Rural | $500-$1,000 | rural areas, traditional villages |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- Abdoun: a popular area for expats, with modern apartments and amenities, rent range $500-$1,000 USD per month\n- Jabal Amman: a historic neighborhood with a mix of old and new buildings, rent range $400-$800 USD per month\n- Shmeisani: a bustling area with shops and restaurants, rent range $300-$600 USD per month\n- Deir Ghbar: a quiet, upscale neighborhood with luxury apartments, rent range $800-$1,500 USD per month\n- Khalda: a family-friendly area with modern apartments and amenities, rent range $400-$900 USD per month\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Jordan [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods and prices thoroughly before starting your housing search\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent to find a suitable apartment\n- Inspect the property carefully before signing a lease agreement\n- Negotiate the rent and terms of the lease, if possible\n- Be aware of scams and fake listings, and never pay a deposit without seeing the property first\n- Utilities such as water, electricity, and internet are usually not included in the rent, and may need to be set up separately\n- Furnished apartments are less common in Jordan, so be prepared to purchase or rent furniture if needed\n- Consider hiring a local translator or assistant to help with the rental process, if you're not fluent in Arabic\n- Be prepared to provide documentation, such as a passport and proof of income, to secure a rental agreement",
