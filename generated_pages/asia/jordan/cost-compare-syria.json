Jordan has a relatively stable economy, with a strong service sector and a growing tourism industry, which contributes to its higher cost of living. In contrast, Syria has faced significant economic challenges in recent years, including a devastating civil war, which has led to a decline in its economy and a subsequent decrease in the cost of living. On average, Jordan is around 20-30% more expensive than Syria, with the difference being most pronounced in categories such as housing, food, and transportation.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Jordan has a relatively high GDP per capita, with a strong focus on services and industry, whereas Syria's economy has been heavily impacted by the ongoing conflict. As a result, Syria's cost of living is generally lower, with many everyday items and services being significantly cheaper than in Jordan. However, it's worth noting that the cost of living in Syria can vary greatly depending on the region, with some areas being more expensive than others due to factors such as security and access to basic services.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Jordan (USD) | Syria (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 450 | 200 | 55% more expensive |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 250 | 150 | 40% more expensive |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 700 | 400 | 42% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Jordan (USD) | Syria (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 15 | 5 | 66% more expensive |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 300 | 150 | 50% more expensive |\n| Beer (500ml) | 5 | 2 | 60% more expensive |\n| Coffee | 2 | 1 | 50% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Jordan (USD) | Syria (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 20 | 10 | 50% more expensive |\n| Taxi (per km) | 1 | 0.5 | 50% more expensive |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 1.2 | 0.8 | 33% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Jordan (USD) | Syria (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 100 | 50 | 50% more expensive |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 30 | 20 | 33% more expensive |\n| Mobile Plan | 20 | 10 | 50% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Jordan (USD) | Syria (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 800 | 400 | 50% |\n| Mid-Range | 1,200 | 600 | 50% |\n| Comfortable | 2,000 | 1,000 | 50% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Jordan is cheaper for:**\n- High-end shopping and luxury goods\n- International cuisine and fine dining\n- Tourist attractions and activities\n- Modern amenities and facilities\n- **Syria is cheaper for:**\n- Local transportation and fuel\n- Traditional cuisine and street food\n- Accommodation options, particularly outside of city centers\n- Basic utilities and internet services\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nThe cost of living in Jordan and Syria varies significantly, with Jordan being the more expensive of the two countries.
