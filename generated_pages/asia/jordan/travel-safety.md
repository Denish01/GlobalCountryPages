[SECTION] Overall Safety Assessment [/SECTION]
Jordan is generally a safe country to visit, with low crime rates compared to other countries in the region. The majority of visitors to Jordan have a trouble-free experience, and the country has a reputation for being welcoming to tourists. However, as with any foreign travel, it's essential to take common-sense precautions to ensure your safety. Jordan has a strong police presence, and tourist areas are generally well-patrolled. The country has also taken steps to improve security in recent years, including increasing the number of security cameras and patrols in popular tourist areas.

Despite the overall safety of Jordan, there are some areas that visitors should exercise caution in. The country's proximity to conflict zones in Syria and Iraq means that there is a risk of terrorism and instability in the region. Additionally, there have been reports of petty crime, such as pickpocketing and scams, in tourist areas. Visitors should also be aware of the risk of demonstrations and protests, particularly in the capital city of Amman. Overall, Jordan is a safe country to visit, but it's essential to stay informed and take necessary precautions to ensure a safe and enjoyable trip.
