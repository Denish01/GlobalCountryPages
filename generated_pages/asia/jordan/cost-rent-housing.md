[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Jordan is relatively stable, with a mix of old and new buildings available for rent. Typical lease terms range from 6-12 months, with a security deposit equivalent to one or two months' rent required. Tenant rights are protected under Jordanian law, and renters are advised to carefully review their lease agreements before signing. Compared to its regional neighbors, Jordan's housing costs are relatively moderate, with prices lower than in Israel and Palestine, but higher than in Syria and Iraq. The country's housing market is also influenced by the presence of international organizations and expatriate communities, which can drive up demand and prices in certain areas.

The Jordanian government has implemented various initiatives to support the housing sector, including subsidies for low-income households and investments in affordable housing projects. However, the demand for housing, particularly in urban areas like Amman, remains high, and prices can be steep for those on a limited budget. Expats and foreigners may find that they need to budget more for housing in Jordan than they would in other countries in the region, but the overall cost of living remains relatively affordable. It's worth noting that the **inflation rate** in Jordan is relatively low, at 1.6%, which can help to keep housing costs stable over time.
