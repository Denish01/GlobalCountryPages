[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Jordan has three main international airports, with Queen Alia International Airport being the largest and most convenient for travelers, offering direct flights to major hubs in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. The other two international airports are King Hussein International Airport in Aqaba and Amman Civil Airport, which mainly serves as a hub for charter flights and domestic connections. Direct flight hubs to Jordan include major European cities like London, Paris, and Amsterdam, as well as regional hubs like Dubai and Istanbul. Overland entry points are also available, with border crossings from neighboring countries like Syria, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Israel, and Palestine, although these may be subject to restrictions and requirements.

Travelers can also enter Jordan by land or sea, with the port city of Aqaba being a popular entry point for those arriving by ferry from Egypt or other Red Sea destinations. The main border crossings are located at Aqaba, Amman, and the King Hussein Bridge, which connects Jordan to Israel and the West Bank. It is essential to check the current entry requirements and any necessary visas before attempting to cross the border. Additionally, it is recommended to research the best routes and transportation options in advance to ensure a smooth and hassle-free journey.

Jordan has a limited domestic air network, with Royal Jordanian Airlines being the main carrier offering flights between Amman, Aqaba, and other smaller airports. The main domestic routes include Amman to Aqaba, which is a popular route for tourists and business travelers alike. Booking in advance is recommended, especially during peak travel seasons, and approximate costs can range from $50 to $200 for a one-way ticket, depending on the route and time of year. It is also worth noting that domestic flights may be subject to changes or cancellations due to weather conditions or other factors, so it is essential to stay informed and plan accordingly.
