The country's strategic location and trade agreements with neighboring countries help keep prices stable, but factors such as transportation costs, taxes, and seasonal fluctuations can drive prices up or down. Jordanians tend to prioritize home cooking, with many families preparing traditional meals like **mansaf** (lamb cooked in a yogurt sauce) and **maqluba** (a rice and vegetable dish), which helps keep food costs lower. However, the growing middle class and increasing tourism have led to a rise in eating-out culture, with many restaurants and cafes offering a range of international and local cuisine options.\n\nThe cost of food in Jordan can also vary depending on the location, with cities like Amman and Aqaba tend to have higher prices than smaller towns and rural areas. Additionally, the country's reliance on imported goods, particularly for items like meat and dairy products, can impact prices. However, Jordan is also known for its rich agricultural produce, with many local farms producing high-quality fruits, vegetables, and grains, which helps keep prices stable and supports the local economy.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $1.50 | 1.10 JOD | |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $0.50 | 0.35 JOD | |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $1.20 | 0.85 JOD | |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $1.00 | 0.70 JOD | |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $4.00 | 2.80 JOD | |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $6.00 | 4.20 JOD | |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $2.00 | 1.40 JOD | |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $1.50 | 1.05 JOD | |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $1.00 | 0.70 JOD | |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $0.80 | 0.55 JOD | |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $5.00 | 3.50 JOD | |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $0.50 | 0.35 JOD | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $3-5 | (typical dishes like falafel, shawarma) |\n| Casual Restaurant | $10-15 | (one person, 2-3 courses) |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $20-30 | (3 courses, moderate wine list) |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $50-70 | (upscale, extensive wine list) |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $3-5 | |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $5-7 | |\n| Cappuccino | $2-3 | |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $1-2 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nWhen it comes to shopping for groceries, Jordan offers a mix of modern supermarkets and traditional open-air markets, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Supermarkets tend to offer a wider range of products, including imported goods, but prices can be higher than at local markets. On the other hand, local markets, such as the **souks** in Amman and Aqaba, offer fresh produce, meats, and spices at competitive prices, but the quality and variety can vary. In general, it's best to buy fresh produce, meats, and dairy products at local markets, while supermarkets are better for packaged goods, household items, and imported products.\n\nThe price difference between supermarkets and local markets can be significant, with some items costing up to 50% more at supermarkets. However, supermarkets often offer convenience, air-conditioning, and a wider range of products, which can be appealing to tourists and expats. At local markets, bargaining is expected, and vendors often offer discounts for bulk purchases or regular customers. It's also common to find **street food** vendors and **food stalls** at local markets, offering traditional snacks and meals at affordable prices.\n\n[SECTION] Local Food Tips [/SECTION]\n- The cheapest way to eat in Jordan is to try **street food**, such as falafel, shawarma, and **kebabs**, which can cost as little as $1-2 USD per serving.\n- Local staples like **hummus**, **tabbouleh**, and **fattoush** are not only delicious but also good value, with prices starting from $2-3 USD per serving.\n- **Mansaf**, the national dish, is a must-try, but can be expensive, with prices ranging from $10-20 USD per serving.\n- Avoid buying imported products, which can be expensive and may not be as fresh as local alternatives.\n- **Local markets** are a great place to find fresh produce, meats, and spices at competitive prices, but be prepared to bargain and haggle.\n- For a unique dining experience, try a **traditional Jordanian meal** at a local restaurant, which can cost around $10-20 USD per person.",
