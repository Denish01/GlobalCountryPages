# Jordan Visa & Entry Requirements

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Jordan before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Jordan has a moderate visa policy, with a mix of visa-free access, visa on arrival, and prior visa requirements for different nationalities. Citizens of around 50 countries can enter Jordan visa-free, while others can obtain a visa on arrival or through prior application. The Jordanian government has been working to simplify and streamline its visa process to attract more tourists and business travelers.

The visa policy is designed to balance security concerns with the need to promote tourism and economic development. Visitors from eligible countries can stay in Jordan for up to 30 days, depending on the type of visa or entry permit they receive. Jordan has also introduced an e-visa system to make it easier for visitors to apply for a visa online before their trip.
