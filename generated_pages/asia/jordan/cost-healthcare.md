[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Jordan's healthcare system is a mixed model, combining both public and private providers. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to the private system, with longer wait times and less advanced equipment. However, the public system is more affordable, with costs subsidized by the government. For locals, the public system is often the primary option, while foreigners and those with higher incomes tend to opt for private healthcare. The private system offers higher quality care, with more modern facilities and better-trained staff, but at a significantly higher cost. It is recommended that individuals have some form of health insurance to cover unexpected medical expenses, as out-of-pocket costs can be high.

The healthcare system in Jordan is relatively well-developed, with a wide range of medical specialties and services available. However, there can be significant disparities in the quality of care between public and private facilities, as well as between urban and rural areas. In general, the best medical care is found in the larger cities, such as Amman, where there are more private hospitals and specialized clinics. For foreigners, it is often recommended to seek care at private facilities, which tend to have more English-speaking staff and modern equipment.
