[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]
The linguistic landscape of Jordan is predominantly Arabic, with the official language being **Modern Standard Arabic**. However, the majority of the population speaks a dialect known as **Jordanian Arabic**, which is closely related to other Levantine dialects spoken in Syria, Lebanon, and Palestine. There are also several regional dialects spoken in different parts of the country, such as the **Bedouin dialect** spoken by the Bedouin tribes in the southern and eastern regions. English is widely understood in tourist areas, hotels, and restaurants, particularly among the younger population and those in the service industry. However, outside of these areas, English proficiency may be limited, and learning a few basic Arabic phrases can go a long way in enhancing your travel experience.

Jordan is also home to several minority languages, including **Circassian** and **Chechen**, spoken by the Circassian and Chechen communities who were relocated to the region in the late 19th century. These languages are not widely spoken, but they are an important part of the country's cultural heritage. In addition to Arabic and English, many Jordanians also speak other languages, such as **French** and **German**, particularly in the tourism and business sectors.

The use of English in Jordan is widespread, particularly in urban areas and among the educated population. Many signs, menus, and official documents are translated into English, making it relatively easy for English-speaking tourists to navigate the country. However, learning a few basic Arabic phrases can help to break the ice and show respect for the local culture.
