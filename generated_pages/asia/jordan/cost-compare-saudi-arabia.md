[SECTION] Overview: Jordan vs Saudi Arabia [/SECTION]
Jordan and Saudi Arabia are two neighboring countries in the Middle East with distinct economies and cost of living. Jordan has a relatively small economy, with a GDP per capita of $9,433, whereas Saudi Arabia has a much larger economy, driven by its vast oil reserves, with a GDP per capita of $28,310. The cost of living in Jordan is generally lower, with prices for housing, food, and transportation being more affordable. In contrast, Saudi Arabia has a higher cost of living, particularly when it comes to housing and transportation.

Jordan has a more diverse economy, with a strong focus on tourism, manufacturing, and services, which has helped to keep prices relatively low. On the other hand, Saudi Arabia's economy is heavily reliant on oil exports, which has led to a higher cost of living, particularly in cities like Riyadh and Jeddah.
