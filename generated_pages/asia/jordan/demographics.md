[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
The population of Jordan has been steadily increasing over the years, with a growth rate of approximately 1.3%. This growth can be attributed to a combination of natural increase and migration, particularly from neighboring countries such as Syria and Iraq. Jordan's population is relatively young, with a median age of 22.9 years, and the majority of the population resides in urban areas, with around 80.3% living in cities. The country's population density is approximately 129 people per square kilometer, which is relatively high compared to other countries in the region.

In terms of urbanization, Jordan has experienced significant growth in recent years, with many people moving to cities such as Amman, Zarqa, and Irbid in search of better economic opportunities. This has led to an increase in the urban population, with many rural areas experiencing a decline in population. The government has implemented various initiatives to address the challenges associated with urbanization, including the development of new infrastructure and the provision of social services.

Jordan has also been affected by migration patterns, with many people fleeing conflict in neighboring countries and seeking refuge in Jordan. This has placed a strain on the country's resources, but the government has made efforts to provide support to refugees and to integrate them into Jordanian society.
