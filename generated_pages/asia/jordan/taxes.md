Jordan has a **territorial taxation** system, where residents are taxed on their income earned within Jordan, regardless of where it is earned. Non-residents are taxed only on their Jordan-sourced income.

Individuals who are not residents of Jordan are considered non-residents and are only subject to tax on their Jordan-sourced income.

The tax system in Jordan is administered by the **Income Tax Department**, which is responsible for collecting taxes, auditing tax returns, and providing tax guidance to taxpayers. The tax year in Jordan runs from January to December, and taxpayers are required to file their tax returns by April 30th of the following year.
