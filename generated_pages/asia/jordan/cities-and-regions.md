Jordan is divided into 12 governorates, each of which is further subdivided into departments and then into municipalities or districts. The governorates are the primary administrative divisions of the country, and they are responsible for providing various public services to the population. The governorates are also the basis for the country's electoral system, with each governorate electing a number of representatives to the national parliament.

The 12 governorates of Jordan are Amman, Irbid, Zarqa, Balqa, Karak, Tafiela, Ma'an, Mafraq, Jarash, Ajloun, Aqaba, and Madaba. Each governorate has its own capital city, which is usually the largest city in the governorate.
