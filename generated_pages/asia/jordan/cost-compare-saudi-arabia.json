Jordan has a relatively small economy, with a GDP per capita of $9,433, whereas Saudi Arabia has a much larger economy, driven by its vast oil reserves, with a GDP per capita of $28,310. The cost of living in Jordan is generally lower, with prices for housing, food, and transportation being more affordable. In contrast, Saudi Arabia has a higher cost of living, particularly when it comes to housing and transportation.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Jordan has a more diverse economy, with a strong focus on tourism, manufacturing, and services, which has helped to keep prices relatively low. On the other hand, Saudi Arabia's economy is heavily reliant on oil exports, which has led to a higher cost of living, particularly in cities like Riyadh and Jeddah. Overall, Jordan is a more affordable option for expats, students, and retirees, while Saudi Arabia is better suited for those with higher incomes or those who are looking for a more luxurious lifestyle.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Jordan (USD) | Saudi Arabia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | $400 | $700 | 43% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | $250 | $450 | 44% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | $700 | $1,200 | 42% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Jordan (USD) | Saudi Arabia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | $10 | $15 | 33% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | $300 | $500 | 40% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | $5 | $10 | 50% cheaper |\n| Coffee | $2 | $3 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Jordan (USD) | Saudi Arabia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | $20 | $30 | 33% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | $0.50 | $1.00 | 50% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $0.60 | $0.80 | 25% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Jordan (USD) | Saudi Arabia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | $100 | $150 | 33% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | $30 | $50 | 40% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | $20 | $30 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Jordan (USD) | Saudi Arabia (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | $800 | $1,200 | 33% |\n| Mid-Range | $1,200 | $2,000 | 40% |\n| Comfortable | $2,000 | $3,500 | 43% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Jordan is cheaper for:**\n- Rent and housing, with prices being 40-50% lower than in Saudi Arabia\n- Food and dining, with meals and groceries being 30-40% cheaper\n- Transportation, with taxi fares and fuel being 25-50% lower\n- Utilities and internet, with bills being 30-40% cheaper\n- **Saudi Arabia is cheaper for:**\n- High-end shopping, with luxury brands being 10-20% cheaper\n- Fine dining, with high-end restaurants being 10-20% cheaper\n- Travel, with flights and hotels being 10-20% cheaper due to the country's well-connected airports and luxury travel options\n- Business services, with office space and business utilities being 10-20% cheaper\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nFor expats, students, and retirees, Jordan is a more affordable option, with a lower cost of living and a more relaxed pace of life.
