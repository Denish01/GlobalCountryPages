[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Jordan is a sovereign country located in the Middle East, in the continent of Asia. It is situated in a region of great strategic importance, bordered by several countries, including Syria to the north, Iraq to the northeast, Saudi Arabia to the east and south, and Israel and Palestine to the west. The country's unique location allows it to serve as a bridge between the East and the West, with the Gulf of Aqaba providing a small coastline along its southwestern border. Jordan's proximity to the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea also makes it an important hub for trade and commerce.

Jordan's borders are largely defined by its natural geography, with the Jordan River forming a significant portion of its western border with Israel and Palestine. The country's eastern border with Saudi Arabia is largely desert, with the **Syrian Desert** stretching across much of the region. The northern border with Syria is marked by a series of hills and mountains, while the southern border with Saudi Arabia is generally flat and arid. Overall, Jordan's location and borders have played a significant role in shaping its history, culture, and economy.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Jordan's terrain is characterized by a diverse range of landscapes, including mountains, deserts, and valleys. The country's western edge is marked by the **Jordan Rift Valley**, a deep trough that runs along the Jordan River and includes the **Dead Sea**, the lowest point on Earth. The valley is flanked by the **Judaean Mountains** to the west and the **Transjordan Plateau** to the east. The plateau is a high, arid region that stretches across much of central Jordan, with the **Syrian Desert** covering much of the eastern part of the country.

The southern part of Jordan is dominated by the **Hisma Plateau**, a region of rugged hills and mountains that stretches as far as the Gulf of Aqaba. The plateau is home to several important natural features, including the **Wadi Rum** valley, a stunning example of desert erosion that has been carved out over millions of years. Jordan's landscape is also marked by several important rivers, including the **Jordan River**, which flows through the western part of the country and into the Dead Sea. The country's diverse terrain and landscape have created a range of unique ecosystems, supporting a wide variety of flora and fauna.

The country's diverse geography has also played a significant role in shaping its human history, with many ancient civilizations having settled in the region. The **Moab Plateau**, for example, is home to several important archaeological sites, including the ancient city of **Petra**, which is carved into the sandstone cliffs. The plateau is also home to several important natural features, including the **Wadi Araba**, a deep valley that stretches from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba.
