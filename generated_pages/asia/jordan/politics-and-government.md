[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Jordan is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **executive branch** is headed by the monarch, who serves as the head of state, and the prime minister, who is the head of government. The **legislative branch** is composed of a bicameral parliament, consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives. The **judicial branch** is independent and composed of the Supreme Court and lower courts. Jordan has a **unitary system**, where the central government has significant powers and authority over the various regions and governorates. The country's **constitution**, which was adopted in 1952, outlines the framework of the government and the relationship between the branches.

The **separation of powers** is a key feature of Jordan's political system, with each branch having distinct responsibilities and powers. The executive branch is responsible for enforcing laws and policies, while the legislative branch is responsible for making laws. The judicial branch is responsible for interpreting laws and ensuring that they are consistent with the constitution. The system of government in Jordan is designed to provide a balance of power and prevent any one branch from dominating the others.

The **parliamentary system** in Jordan is based on a mix of **proportional representation** and **single-member districts**. The House of Representatives is composed of 130 members, who are elected by the people for a term of four years. The Senate is composed of 65 members, who are appointed by the monarch for a term of four years. The parliament has the power to pass laws, approve the government's budget, and exercise oversight over the executive branch.
