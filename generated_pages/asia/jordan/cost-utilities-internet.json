  "content": "The cost of utilities and internet in Jordan can vary depending on several factors, including the size of the apartment, usage, and provider, but on average, a monthly utility bill for an 85 sqm apartment can range from $150 to $300 USD.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Utilities (85 sqm apt): ($200 USD)\nInternet (60 Mbps): ($30 USD/month)\nMobile Data (10GB): ($15 USD/month)\nElectricity Cost: ($0.15 per kWh)\nCurrency: JOD\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nJordan's utility infrastructure is relatively well-developed, with a reliable supply of electricity, water, and gas. However, costs can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher electricity bills during the summer months due to increased air conditioning usage. The Jordanian government has implemented measures to reduce energy consumption and promote renewable energy sources, which may impact utility costs in the long run. The overall quality of utility services is good, with minimal disruptions and a relatively efficient billing system.\n\nThe cost of utilities in Jordan is generally stable, but it can be affected by factors such as inflation and changes in global energy prices. The government has implemented a subsidy system to help low-income households pay for their utility bills, which can help reduce the burden of utility costs on vulnerable populations. Additionally, some utility providers offer prepaid plans and other options that can help consumers manage their costs more effectively.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $80 | $120 | $180 | |\n| Water | $10 | $15 | $20 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $5 | $10 | $15 | (included in rent or paid separately) |\n| **Total** | **$115** | **$175** | **$255** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $20-30 | 10-20 Mbps | Orange, Umniah |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $40-60 | 50-100 Mbps | Zain, Jordan Telecom |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-20 | 5-10 GB | Orange, Umniah |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-50 | 10-50 GB | Zain, Jordan Telecom |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $50-100 | varies | Orange, Umniah |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (e.g. Shahid, Wavo) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Jordan, you typically need to provide a copy of your passport, a rental agreement, and proof of address to the utility provider.\n- Prepaid electricity plans can be a good option for consumers who want to manage their energy usage and avoid unexpected bills.\n- Some internet providers, such as Orange and Umniah, offer discounts for long-term contracts or bundle deals that include phone and TV services.\n- To save on utility bills, consumers can take steps such as using energy-efficient appliances, turning off lights and electronics when not in use, and using public transportation or carpooling.\n- It's a good idea to research and compare prices among different utility providers to find the best deals and services that suit your needs and budget.",
