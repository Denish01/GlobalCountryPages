[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Jordan has a **dry climate**, with very little rainfall throughout the year. The country can be divided into three main climate zones: the **Mediterranean climate** in the northwest, the **desert climate** in the east and south, and the **highland climate** in the central and western regions. The dry season, which runs from May to October, is characterized by hot temperatures and very little rainfall, while the wet season, which runs from November to April, is mild and wet. The seasons can greatly affect travel in Jordan, with the summer months being the peak tourist season, but also the hottest and most crowded. The winter months, on the other hand, are the coolest and wettest, but also the best time to see the country's flora and fauna.

The spring and autumn months are considered the best time to visit Jordan, as the weather is mild and pleasant, with average temperatures ranging from 15°C to 25°C. These periods are ideal for hiking, camping, and exploring the country's many historical and natural attractions. The summer months, while hot and crowded, are still a great time to visit Jordan's **beaches** and **resorts**, such as Aqaba and the Dead Sea. The winter months, while cool and wet, are a great time to see the country's **wildflowers** and **green landscapes**.

The seasons can also affect the prices of accommodations and tourist services, with the peak season being the most expensive. However, the budget season, which runs from December to February, can be a great time to visit Jordan, as prices are lower and the crowds are smaller. It's worth noting that the **Ramadan** month, which usually falls in May or June, can also affect travel in Jordan, as some tourist attractions and services may be closed or operate on reduced hours.
