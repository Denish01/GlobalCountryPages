  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Jordan varies significantly between public and private facilities, with the average health expenditure per capita being $342, and out-of-pocket spend being 34.5% of total healthcare costs.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $342\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 34.5%\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 191\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: JOD\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nJordan's healthcare system is a mixed model, combining both public and private providers. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to the private system, with longer wait times and less advanced equipment. However, the public system is more affordable, with costs subsidized by the government. For locals, the public system is often the primary option, while foreigners and those with higher incomes tend to opt for private healthcare. The private system offers higher quality care, with more modern facilities and better-trained staff, but at a significantly higher cost. It is recommended that individuals have some form of health insurance to cover unexpected medical expenses, as out-of-pocket costs can be high.\n\nThe healthcare system in Jordan is relatively well-developed, with a wide range of medical specialties and services available. However, there can be significant disparities in the quality of care between public and private facilities, as well as between urban and rural areas. In general, the best medical care is found in the larger cities, such as Amman, where there are more private hospitals and specialized clinics. For foreigners, it is often recommended to seek care at private facilities, which tend to have more English-speaking staff and modern equipment.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $10-$20 | $50-$100 | |\n| Specialist Consultation | $20-$50 | $100-$200 | |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$200 | |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $100-$500 | |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$2,000 | |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,000-$3,000 | |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | |\n| X-Ray | $20-$100 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Covers basic medical services, including doctor visits and hospital stays |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-$300 | Covers a wide range of medical services, including specialist consultations and surgeries |\n| International / Expat | $200-$500 | Covers medical services worldwide, including emergency evacuations and repatriations |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Common medications, such as antibiotics and painkillers, can be purchased over-the-counter at pharmacies for $5-$20.\n- Prescription medications, such as those for chronic conditions, can cost $10-$50 per month.\n- Pharmacies are widely available in urban areas, but may be less common in rural areas.\n- Many pharmacies carry a range of medications, including international brands.\n- Prescription rules vary, but generally require a doctor's prescription for controlled substances.\n- Over-the-counter medications are widely available, but may require a pharmacist's consultation for certain items.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the emergency number, 191, or to seek care at the nearest hospital.

For foreigners, it is often recommended to seek care at private hospitals, which tend to have more modern equipment and English-speaking staff. Some of the best hospitals for foreigners in Jordan include the King Hussein Medical Center and the Jordan Hospital, both located in Amman. These hospitals offer a range of medical services, including emergency care, surgeries, and specialist consultations.
