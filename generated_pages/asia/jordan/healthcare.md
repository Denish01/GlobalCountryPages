[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Jordan's healthcare system is a mixed model, combining both public and private providers to deliver medical services to its population of 11.4 million people. The public sector is primarily responsible for providing healthcare to the majority of the population, with a network of government hospitals and clinics throughout the country. The private sector, on the other hand, offers high-quality medical care, often with more modern facilities and equipment, and is popular among those who can afford it. The quality of care in Jordan is generally good, with many medical professionals having received training in Europe or North America. However, there can be significant disparities in access to healthcare between urban and rural areas, with rural areas often having limited access to specialized medical care.

The Ministry of Health is responsible for overseeing the healthcare system in Jordan, and it has implemented various initiatives to improve the quality and accessibility of healthcare services. Despite these efforts, the healthcare system in Jordan still faces challenges, including a shortage of medical professionals in certain specialties and a lack of resources in some areas. The country has made significant progress in recent years, however, and its healthcare system is now considered one of the best in the region.

Jordan's healthcare system is also supported by a network of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and international organizations, which provide a range of health services, including primary healthcare, maternal and child health, and disease prevention. These organizations often work in partnership with the government and private sector providers to deliver healthcare services to vulnerable populations, such as refugees and disadvantaged communities.
