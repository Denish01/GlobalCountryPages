The country's population density is approximately 129 people per square kilometer, which is relatively high compared to other countries in the region.\n\nIn terms of urbanization, Jordan has experienced significant growth in recent years, with many people moving to cities such as Amman, Zarqa, and Irbid in search of better economic opportunities. This has led to an increase in the urban population, with many rural areas experiencing a decline in population. The government has implemented various initiatives to address the challenges associated with urbanization, including the development of new infrastructure and the provision of social services.\n\nJordan has also been affected by migration patterns, with many people fleeing conflict in neighboring countries and seeking refuge in Jordan.
