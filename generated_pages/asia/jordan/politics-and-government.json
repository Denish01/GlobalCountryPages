The **executive branch** is headed by the monarch, who serves as the head of state, and the prime minister, who is the head of government. The **legislative branch** is composed of a bicameral parliament, consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives. The **judicial branch** is independent and composed of the Supreme Court and lower courts. Jordan has a **unitary system**, where the central government has significant powers and authority over the various regions and governorates. The country's **constitution**, which was adopted in 1952, outlines the framework of the government and the relationship between the branches.\n\nThe **separation of powers** is a key feature of Jordan's political system, with each branch having distinct responsibilities and powers. The executive branch is responsible for enforcing laws and policies, while the legislative branch is responsible for making laws. The judicial branch is responsible for interpreting laws and ensuring that they are consistent with the constitution. The system of government in Jordan is designed to provide a balance of power and prevent any one branch from dominating the others.\n\nThe **parliamentary system** in Jordan is based on a mix of **proportional representation** and **single-member districts**. The House of Representatives is composed of 130 members, who are elected by the people for a term of four years. The Senate is composed of 65 members, who are appointed by the monarch for a term of four years. The parliament has the power to pass laws, approve the government's budget, and exercise oversight over the executive branch.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | Royal Court | King Abdullah II | Head of State |\n| Executive | Prime Minister's Office | Prime Minister Bisher Al-Khasawneh | Head of Government |\n| Legislative | Parliament of Jordan | Speaker of the House of Representatives | Lawmaking and oversight |\n| Judicial | Supreme Court | President of the Supreme Court | Judicial review and interpretation of laws |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Major Political Parties [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Party | Position | Leader | Seats | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Islamic Action Front | Islamist | Hamza Mansour | 10 | Largest opposition party |\n| Jordanian Communist Party | Left-wing | Munir Hamarneh | 3 | Secular and socialist party |\n| National Constitutional Party | Centrist | Ahmed Safadi | 5 | Supports constitutional monarchy and democratic reforms |\n| Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party | Left-wing | Taysir Al-Huneidi | 2 | Pan-Arabist and socialist party |\n| Muslim Brotherhood | Islamist | Abdul Majid Thunaybat | 5 | Influential Islamist movement |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Elections [/SECTION]\n- The electoral system in Jordan is based on a mix of proportional representation and single-member districts.\n- Parliamentary elections are held every four years, with the most recent election taking place in 2020.\n- The next parliamentary election is scheduled to take place in 2024.\n- Voter participation in Jordan's elections is relatively low, with a turnout of around 30-40% in recent elections.\n\n[SECTION] Political Stability & Challenges [/SECTION]\n- Jordan's political climate is generally stable, with a strong monarch and a relatively effective government.\n- The country faces significant challenges, including a large refugee population, high unemployment, and a struggling economy.\n- Regional dynamics, including the conflict in Syria and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, have a significant impact on Jordan's politics and stability.\n- Jordan has a relatively high level of **press freedom**, with a ranking of 128th out of 180 countries in the Press Freedom Index.\n- The country has a moderate level of **corruption**, with a ranking of 59th out of 180 countries in the Corruption Perceptions Index.\n- Jordan has a relatively low level of **human rights** concerns, with a ranking of 64th out of 178 countries in the Human Freedom Index.\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Relations [/SECTION]\n- Jordan is a member of the **United Nations** and the **Arab League**, and has diplomatic relations with over 100 countries.\n- The country has a **peace treaty** with Israel, which was signed in 1994, and has a relatively stable relationship with its neighbor.\n- Jordan is a key partner in the **US-led coalition** against the Islamic State (ISIS) and has received significant military aid from the United States.\n- The country has a **strategic partnership** with the European Union, and has signed several agreements on trade, security, and cooperation.\n- Jordan has a **regional role** in promoting stability and security in the Middle East, and has hosted several international conferences and summits on regional issues.",
