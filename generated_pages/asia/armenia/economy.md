[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Armenia has a lower-middle-income economy, with a GDP per capita of around $4,130. The country's economic development level is considered to be relatively low compared to other European and Central Asian countries. However, Armenia has made significant progress in recent years, with the economy growing at an average annual rate of around 4%. The country's economic classification is a mix of industrial and agricultural sectors, with a growing services sector. Armenia's economic trajectory is expected to continue on a positive path, driven by investments in infrastructure, tourism, and technology.

Armenia's economy is heavily reliant on remittances from abroad, with many citizens working in countries such as Russia and the United States. The country is also rich in natural resources, including copper, gold, and molybdenum, which are major contributors to the economy. However, Armenia's economic growth is constrained by its limited access to international markets, due to its landlocked location and closed borders with Turkey and Azerbaijan.

The Armenian government has implemented various reforms to improve the business environment and attract foreign investment. These reforms include simplifying tax procedures, reducing bureaucracy, and improving the rule of law. As a result, Armenia has seen an increase in foreign investment in recent years, particularly in the technology and tourism sectors.
