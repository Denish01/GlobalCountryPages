[SECTION] How Armenia Is Divided [/SECTION]
Armenia is a sovereign country located in the South Caucasus region of Asia. The country is divided into 11 provinces, also known as marzes, which are further subdivided into cities, towns, and villages. The provinces of Armenia are Aragatsotn, Ararat, Armavir, Gegharkunik, Kotayk, Lori, Shirak, Syunik, Tavush, Vayots Dzor, and Yerevan. Each province has its own administrative center and is responsible for managing local affairs.

The administrative structure of Armenia is designed to provide a high level of autonomy to the provinces, allowing them to manage their own local affairs and make decisions that are in the best interest of their residents. The provinces are responsible for providing a range of services, including education, healthcare, and infrastructure development. The capital city, Yerevan, is a special case, as it is not part of any province and is instead governed directly by the central government.
