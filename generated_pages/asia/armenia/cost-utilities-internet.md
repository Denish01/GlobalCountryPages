[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Armenia's utility infrastructure is relatively well-developed, with a high percentage of households having access to electricity, water, and gas. However, the cost of utilities can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher costs during the winter months due to increased demand for heating. The country's **inflation rate** is relatively low, at 0.3%, which helps to keep utility costs stable. Additionally, the Armenian government has implemented various measures to reduce energy consumption and promote the use of renewable energy sources.

The quality of utility services in Armenia is generally good, with a reliable supply of electricity and water. However, there may be occasional disruptions to services, particularly during periods of high demand or maintenance. It is also worth noting that the cost of utilities can vary depending on the location, with urban areas tend to have higher costs than rural areas. Furthermore, the **GDP per capita** of $22,823 and **health expenditure per capita** of $767 can influence the overall cost of living, including utilities.
