The cost of living in Armenia is lower compared to its neighboring countries, such as Georgia and Azerbaijan. However, the cost of living can vary depending on the lifestyle and location. A budget of $400 per month can provide a basic but comfortable life, while a mid-range budget of $900 per month can offer a more relaxed lifestyle with some luxuries. A comfortable lifestyle with a budget of $1,600 per month can provide a high standard of living with many amenities.\n\nThe affordability of Armenia is also influenced by its low inflation rate of 0.3%, which means that the cost of living is relatively stable. Additionally, the country's low education spend of 2.4% of GDP and high out-of-pocket health spend of 80.5% of health expenditure per capita may affect the cost of living for individuals. Overall, Armenia can be an attractive destination for digital nomads, retirees, and students looking for an affordable and culturally rich experience.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Breakdown [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Category | Budget ($) | Mid-Range ($) | Comfortable ($) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rent (1BR apartment) | 100 | 250 | 400 | (budget=shared/outside, mid=1BR center, comfortable=nice 2BR) |\n| Food & Groceries | 100 | 200 | 300 | (budget=cook mostly, mid=mix, comfortable=eat out often) |\n| Transportation | 20 | 50 | 100 | (budget=public only, mid=mix, comfortable=taxi/car) |\n| Utilities & Internet | 50 | 80 | 120 | (electricity, water, internet, phone) |\n| Healthcare / Insurance | 20 | 50 | 100 | (budget=public only, comfortable=private) |\n| Entertainment & Social | 50 | 100 | 200 | (going out, hobbies, gym) |\n| Clothing & Personal | 20 | 50 | 100 | |\n| Savings / Misc | 40 | 100 | 200 | |\n| **Total** | **400** | **900** | **1,600** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Budget Tier Lifestyles [/SECTION]\nA budget lifestyle of $400 per month in Armenia means sharing an apartment outside of the city center, cooking most meals, and using public transportation.
