The public healthcare system is generally considered to be underfunded and understaffed, although it is free for citizens. Private healthcare providers, on the other hand, offer higher-quality care, but at a cost. In urban areas, such as the capital Yerevan, access to healthcare is generally good, with a range of public and private hospitals and clinics available. However, in rural areas, access to healthcare can be limited, with fewer facilities and less specialized care available. The quality of care can also vary significantly depending on the location and type of facility, with some hospitals and clinics offering high-quality care, while others may be more basic.\n\nThe Armenian government has been working to improve the healthcare system, with a focus on increasing funding and improving access to care, particularly in rural areas. However, there is still a significant gap between the quality of care available in urban and rural areas. Additionally, the healthcare system in Armenia is often characterized by a high level of **out-of-pocket payments**, which can be a significant burden for many citizens.\n\nIn recent years, there has been an increase in the number of private healthcare providers in Armenia, offering a range of specialized services, including **plastic surgery**, **dentistry**, and **cardiology**. These private providers often have more modern facilities and equipment, and may offer higher-quality care than public hospitals and clinics. However, they can also be more expensive, and may not be accessible to all citizens.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Yerevan Medical Center | Yerevan | Private | Cardiology, Neurology, Oncology | Yes |\n| Erebuni Medical Center | Yerevan | Private | General Surgery, Orthopedics, Urology | Yes |\n| Nairi Medical Center | Yerevan | Private | Plastic Surgery, Dermatology, Ophthalmology | Yes |\n| Armenian American Wellness Center | Yerevan | Private | General Practice, Pediatrics, Gynecology | Yes |\n| Republican Hospital | Yerevan | Public | General Medicine, Surgery, Emergency Care | Limited |\n| Vanadzor Medical Center | Vanadzor | Public | General Medicine, Surgery, Pediatric Care | Limited |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Private health insurance** is recommended for all citizens, particularly those who can afford it, as it can provide access to higher-quality care and specialized services.\n- **Local insurance options** are available, including companies such as Ingo Armenia and Rosgosstrakh Armenia, which offer a range of health insurance plans.\n- **Expats and foreigners** may be able to access private health insurance plans, although these can be more expensive than local options.\n- **Costs** can vary significantly depending on the type of insurance and the level of coverage, although a basic health insurance plan can cost around 50,000-100,000 AMD per year.\n- **Government-sponsored insurance** is available for certain groups, including pensioners and low-income families, although the level of coverage can be limited.\n- **Supplemental insurance** may be necessary for certain specialized services, such as **dental care** or **vision care**.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Medications** are widely available in Armenia, including both prescription and over-the-counter medications.\n- **Prescription requirements** can vary depending on the type of medication, although a prescription from a licensed doctor is generally required for prescription medications.\n- **Common brands** of medications are available, including international brands such as Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline.\n- **Costs** can vary depending on the type of medication and the pharmacy, although many medications are subsidized by the government.\n- **Pharmacy access** is widespread, with many pharmacies available in urban and rural areas, including 24-hour pharmacies in larger cities.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Hepatitis A** and **hepatitis B** vaccinations are recommended for all travelers to Armenia.\n- **Rabies** vaccination is also recommended, particularly for those who will be spending time in rural areas or working with animals.\n- **Tick-borne encephalitis** is a risk in some areas, particularly in the spring and summer months.\n- **Water safety** can be a concern, particularly in rural areas, where the water may not be properly treated.\n- **Food safety** can also be a concern, particularly when eating at street vendors or in rural areas.\n- **Air pollution** can be a problem in urban areas, particularly in Yerevan, where the air quality can be poor.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **Medical tourism** is not a significant industry in Armenia, although some private hospitals and clinics may offer specialized services to foreign patients.\n- **Popular procedures** may include **plastic surgery**, **dentistry**, and **ophthalmology**.\n- **Accredited hospitals** include the Yerevan Medical Center and the Erebuni Medical Center, which have been accredited by international organizations such as the Joint Commission International.\n- **Cost savings** can be significant, particularly for procedures such as **dental implants** or **LASIK eye surgery**.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- **Emergency number** is 103, which can be called in case of a medical emergency.\n- **Ambulance reliability** can be a concern, particularly in rural areas, where ambulances may not be readily available.\n- **Nearest hospitals** can be found in urban areas, although the quality of care can vary significantly depending on the hospital.\n- **Insurance claims** can be complex, particularly for foreign patients, who may need to navigate the local healthcare system and deal with insurance companies.\n- **Language barriers** can also be a concern, particularly for those who do not speak Armenian or Russian, which are the primary languages spoken in Armenia.",
