        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Armenia has a long and complex history, with the <strong>Urartian Kingdom</strong> being one of the earliest known civilizations in the region, dating back to the 9th century BC. The kingdom was eventually conquered by the <strong>Median Empire</strong> in the 6th century BC, followed by the <strong>Achaemenid Empire</strong>. In 301 AD, Armenia became the first country to adopt <strong>Christianity</strong> as its official state religion. The country has been ruled by various empires and dynasties throughout its history, including the <strong>Arab Caliphate</strong>, the <strong>Byzantine Empire</strong>, and the <strong>Safavid Empire</strong>.</p>
        <p>In the modern era, Armenia was part of the <strong>Russian Empire</strong> from 1828 to 1917, and then became an independent republic from 1918 to 1920. However, it was soon incorporated into the <strong>Soviet Union</strong> as one of its constituent republics. Armenia declared its independence from the Soviet Union on September 21, 1991, and has since been a <strong>sovereign state</strong>.</p>
        <p>The country's strategic location at the crossroads of Europe and Asia has made it an important center for trade and cultural exchange throughout history. Armenia's <strong>geography</strong> is characterized by a mountainous landscape, with the <strong>Armenian Highland</strong> covering most of the country. The <strong>Araks River</strong> forms part of the border with Turkey, while the <strong>Debed River</strong> flows through the northern regions.</p>
        <p>Armenia's <strong>independence timeline</strong> is marked by several key events, including the declaration of independence in 1991, the adoption of a new constitution in 1995, and the country's accession to the <strong>Council of Europe</strong> in 2001. Today, Armenia is a member of various international organizations, including the <strong>United Nations</strong>, the <strong>European Union's Eastern Partnership</strong>, and the <strong>Eurasian Economic Union</strong>.</p>
