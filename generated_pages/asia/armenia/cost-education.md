[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Armenia is divided into public and private sectors, with the public sector being the largest. Public schools in Armenia are generally considered to be of good quality, with a strong emphasis on **Armenian language and culture**. However, private schools are becoming increasingly popular, especially among expat families, due to their perceived higher quality of education and more modern facilities. The language of instruction in public schools is Armenian, while private schools may offer instruction in other languages, such as English or Russian. Compulsory education in Armenia lasts for 12 years, from age 6 to 18.

The availability of international schools in Armenia is limited, but there are a few options in the capital city of Yerevan, including the QSI International School of Yerevan and the Yerevan International School. These schools offer a range of international curricula, including the **International Baccalaureate (IB)** and the **Cambridge International Examinations (CIE)**. However, tuition fees at these schools can be quite high, making them inaccessible to many local families.
