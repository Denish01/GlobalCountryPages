  "content": "The population of Armenia is comprised of approximately 3.0 million people, with a diverse range of ethnic groups, languages, and religions, and a mix of urban and rural communities.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nTotal Population: 3.0 million\nPopulation Growth Rate: 0.3%\nMedian Age: 34.8 years\nUrban Population: 64%\nPopulation Density: 103 per km²\nLife Expectancy: 74.8 years\nFertility Rate: 1.7 children per woman\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]\nArmenia has a relatively small population, with a total of approximately 3.0 million people, which is roughly 0.04% of the world's total population. The population growth rate is relatively low, at around 0.3% per annum, which is due to a combination of factors including low fertility rates and emigration. The country has undergone significant urbanization, with around 64% of the population living in urban areas, primarily in the capital city of Yerevan. The population is also experiencing a shift towards an aging population, with a median age of 34.8 years, which has implications for the country's workforce and social security systems.\n\nIn terms of migration patterns, Armenia has experienced significant emigration in recent years, particularly to countries such as Russia and the United States. This has resulted in a significant diaspora community, with estimates suggesting that there are over 5 million people of Armenian descent living outside of the country. The country is also home to a number of migrant workers, primarily from neighboring countries such as Georgia and Azerbaijan.\n\nThe population of Armenia is also affected by a range of social and economic factors, including poverty and unemployment. According to estimates, around 25% of the population lives below the poverty line, and unemployment rates are relatively high, at around 18%. These factors have contributed to a decline in population growth rates and an increase in emigration.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Armenian | 98.1% | Nationwide | Dominant ethnic group |\n| Yazidi | 1.2% | Western Armenia | Kurdish-speaking minority |\n| Russian | 0.5% | Urban areas | Immigrant community |\n| Assyrian | 0.1% | Urban areas | Christian minority |\n| Greek | 0.1% | Urban areas | Immigrant community |\n| Other | 0.1% | Nationwide | Includes smaller minority groups |\n[/TABLE]\nThe ethnic landscape of Armenia is characterized by a dominant Armenian population, which accounts for around 98.1% of the total population.
