Public schools in Armenia are generally considered to be of good quality, with a strong emphasis on **Armenian language and culture**. However, private schools are becoming increasingly popular, especially among expat families, due to their perceived higher quality of education and more modern facilities. The language of instruction in public schools is Armenian, while private schools may offer instruction in other languages, such as English or Russian. Compulsory education in Armenia lasts for 12 years, from age 6 to 18.\n\nThe availability of international schools in Armenia is limited, but there are a few options in the capital city of Yerevan, including the QSI International School of Yerevan and the Yerevan International School. These schools offer a range of international curricula, including the **International Baccalaureate (IB)** and the **Cambridge International Examinations (CIE)**. However, tuition fees at these schools can be quite high, making them inaccessible to many local families.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 (free) | Good quality, but limited resources |\n| Private Primary | $500-$2,000 | Range of quality and facilities, from basic to modern |\n| Public Secondary | $0 (free) | Good quality, but limited resources |\n| Private Secondary | $1,000-$4,000 | Range of quality and facilities, from basic to modern |\n| International School | $5,000-$15,000 | High-quality facilities and instruction, range of curricula |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $100-$500 | $1,000-$2,000 | Limited availability of programs in English |\n| Private University | $1,000-$3,000 | $2,000-$5,000 | Range of quality and facilities, from basic to modern |\n| Top-Ranked University | $2,000-$5,000 | $3,000-$6,000 | Yerevan State University, range of programs in English |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $50-$200 | Limited availability, especially outside Yerevan |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $10-$50 | Range of subjects and qualifications, from basic to advanced |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $100-$500 | Range of languages and levels, from beginner to advanced |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $50-$100 | Basic supplies, such as books and stationery |\n| School Uniform | $20-$50 | Required for most public and private schools |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The **Yerevan State University** is considered to be one of the best universities in Armenia, with a range of programs in English.\n- **Scholarships** are available for international students, but competition is high and funding is limited.\n- **Online learning options** are limited in Armenia, but some universities offer distance learning programs.\n- Education quality in Armenia is generally considered to be good, but **resources can be limited**, especially outside Yerevan.\n- **Private tutoring** is a popular option for students who need extra support, especially in subjects like math and English.\n- Expats and international students may find that **language barriers** can be a challenge, especially outside Yerevan, where English is not widely spoken.",
