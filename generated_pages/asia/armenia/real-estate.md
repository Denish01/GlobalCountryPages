[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The Armenian property market has been steadily growing over the past few years, driven by government initiatives to attract foreign investment and a growing economy. The market is primarily driven by the capital city, Yerevan, which accounts for the majority of property transactions. Currently, the market is characterized by a mix of old and new buildings, with a trend towards modernization and renovation of older properties. The price trajectory has been increasing, with a steady growth of 5-7% per annum. Urban areas, particularly Yerevan, are in high demand, while rural areas are relatively affordable but lack infrastructure and amenities.

The market is also influenced by the country's strategic location, with proximity to Europe and the Middle East, making it an attractive destination for foreign investors. However, the market is still relatively small, and the lack of transparency and standardized regulations can make it challenging for foreign buyers to navigate. Despite these challenges, the Armenian government has implemented various initiatives to simplify the buying process and attract foreign investment.

The rural property market in Armenia is relatively underdeveloped, with limited infrastructure and amenities. However, there are opportunities for investment in rural areas, particularly in the tourism sector, with the development of eco-lodges, guesthouses, and other tourism-related infrastructure. The government has also implemented initiatives to support the development of rural areas, including the provision of subsidies and incentives for investors.
