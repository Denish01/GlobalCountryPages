Armenia has a more **diversified economy** with a strong focus on services, while Azerbaijan's economy is largely driven by its **oil and gas sector**. In terms of cost of living, Armenia tends to be more affordable, with lower prices for accommodation, food, and transportation. However, Azerbaijan's stronger economy and higher average salaries mean that locals may have more purchasing power. Overall, Armenia is a more budget-friendly option for expats, students, and travelers, while Azerbaijan may be more suitable for those with higher incomes or a taste for luxury.\n\nThe cost of living difference between the two countries is significant, with Armenia offering savings of up to 20% on everyday expenses. This is largely due to the fact that Armenia has a more **competitive market** with a wider range of options for accommodation, food, and services. In contrast, Azerbaijan's economy is more **monopolized**, leading to higher prices for certain goods and services. However, Azerbaijan's **modern infrastructure** and **high standard of living** may make it a more attractive option for some, despite the higher costs.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Armenia (USD) | Azerbaijan (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | $250 | $350 | 29% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | $150 | $250 | 40% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | $450 | $700 | 36% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Armenia (USD) | Azerbaijan (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | $5 | $10 | 50% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | $100 | $150 | 33% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | $2 | $3 | 33% cheaper |\n| Coffee | $1.50 | $2.50 | 40% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Armenia (USD) | Azerbaijan (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | $10 | $20 | 50% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | $0.50 | $1.00 | 50% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $0.80 | $1.20 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Armenia (USD) | Azerbaijan (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | $50 | $80 | 37% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | $20 | $30 | 33% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | $10 | $15 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Armenia (USD) | Azerbaijan (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | $500 | $700 | 29% |\n| Mid-Range | $1,000 | $1,400 | 29% |\n| Comfortable | $2,000 | $2,800 | 29% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Armenia is cheaper for:**\n  - Rent and accommodation\n  - Food and dining\n  - Transportation\n  - Utilities and internet\n- **Azerbaijan is cheaper for:**\n  - High-end shopping and luxury goods\n  - International travel and flights\n  - Modern entertainment and leisure activities\n  - High-quality healthcare and medical services\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nFor expats, students, and travelers on a budget, Armenia is the clear winner in terms of cost of living.
