[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Armenia is relatively affordable, with a wide range of options available for expats and locals alike. Typical lease terms in Armenia are for 12 months, with a deposit requirement of one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are generally well-protected, with the law requiring landlords to provide a written contract and maintain the property in good condition. Compared to its regional neighbors, Armenia's housing costs are relatively low, making it an attractive option for those looking to live in the Caucasus region. However, prices can vary significantly depending on the location, with the capital city Yerevan tend to be more expensive than other parts of the country.

The Armenian government has implemented various initiatives to improve the housing market, including programs to support affordable housing and encourage foreign investment. As a result, the market is becoming increasingly attractive to expats and locals alike, with a range of new developments and renovations taking place in recent years. Despite this, the market can still be challenging to navigate, particularly for those who do not speak Armenian. It is essential to work with a reputable real estate agent or property manager to find the right accommodation and ensure a smooth transition.
