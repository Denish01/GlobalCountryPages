[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Armenia's healthcare system is mixed, comprising both public and private facilities, with the public sector being the primary provider of healthcare services. The quality of care in public facilities is generally lower compared to private facilities, which often have better equipment, more qualified staff, and shorter waiting times. For locals, the healthcare system is generally accessible, with most medical services being subsidized by the government. However, foreigners may face challenges in navigating the system, particularly if they do not speak Armenian, and are often recommended to opt for private healthcare services. Having health insurance is not mandatory, but it is highly recommended, especially for foreigners, as it can provide access to better quality care and help reduce out-of-pocket expenses.

The healthcare system in Armenia is primarily funded through out-of-pocket payments, with the government providing some subsidies for certain services. This means that individuals often have to pay for medical services upfront, which can be a significant burden, especially for those with limited financial resources. However, there are some government-funded programs that provide free or low-cost healthcare services to certain segments of the population, such as children, pregnant women, and the elderly. Private health insurance is also available, and many employers offer health insurance as part of their employee benefits package. For foreigners, it is essential to research and purchase health insurance that covers them in Armenia, as many domestic insurance policies may not provide coverage abroad.
