Armenia has a continental climate with four distinct seasons, characterized by cold winters and warm summers. The country can be divided into several climate zones, including the **Armenian Highlands**, which experience a more extreme climate, and the **Ararat Valley**, which has a milder climate. The dry season, from May to October, is the best time to visit Armenia, with warm weather and minimal rainfall. In contrast, the wet season, from November to April, brings significant rainfall and snowfall, making it challenging to travel, especially in the mountainous regions.

The seasons in Armenia significantly affect travel, with the spring and autumn seasons being the most popular times to visit. During these periods, the weather is mild, with average temperatures ranging from 15°C to 25°C, making it ideal for sightseeing, hiking, and other outdoor activities. In contrast, the winter months can be harsh, with temperatures often dropping below -10°C, while the summer months can be extremely hot, with temperatures reaching up to 35°C.

The country's climate and seasons also impact the local culture and traditions, with many festivals and events taking place during the spring and autumn seasons. For example, the **Navasard** festival, which celebrates the Armenian New Year, takes place in August, while the **Yerevan Wine Days** festival, which showcases the country's wine production, occurs in May.
