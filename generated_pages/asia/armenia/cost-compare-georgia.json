  "content": "Armenia is generally cheaper than Georgia, with an overall cost of living difference of around 15-20%.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nArmenia GDP per Capita (PPP): 10,310\nGeorgia GDP per Capita (PPP): 14,440\nArmenia Inflation Rate: 3.1%\nGeorgia Inflation Rate: 4.8%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Armenia\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Armenia vs Georgia [/SECTION]\nArmenia and Georgia are two neighboring countries in the Caucasus region, offering a unique blend of Eastern European and Middle Eastern culture. In terms of cost of living, Armenia is generally cheaper than Georgia, with a difference of around 15-20% in overall expenses. This is largely due to the fact that Armenia has a lower GDP per capita and a more limited economy, resulting in lower prices for goods and services. However, Georgia has a more developed tourism industry and a stronger economy, which can drive up prices in certain areas, such as accommodation and food.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Armenia has a more limited job market and a lower average salary, which means that expats and foreigners may need to rely on external income sources. On the other hand, Georgia has a more developed economy and a growing tourism industry, which can provide more job opportunities and a higher standard of living. Overall, Armenia is a more affordable option for those on a tight budget, while Georgia offers a more comfortable lifestyle for those with a higher income.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Armenia (USD) | Georgia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 250 | 350 | 28% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 150 | 250 | 40% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 400 | 600 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Armenia (USD) | Georgia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 5 | 8 | 37% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 100 | 150 | 33% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | 1.5 | 2.5 | 40% cheaper |\n| Coffee | 1 | 2 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Armenia (USD) | Georgia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 10 | 15 | 33% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | 0.5 | 0.8 | 37% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 0.8 | 1.2 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Armenia (USD) | Georgia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 80 | 120 | 33% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 20 | 30 | 33% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | 10 | 15 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Armenia (USD) | Georgia (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 500 | 700 | 28% |\n| Mid-Range | 800 | 1200 | 33% |\n| Comfortable | 1200 | 1800 | 33% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Armenia is cheaper for:**\n- Rent and housing, with a significant difference in prices for apartments and houses\n- Food and dining, with a wide range of affordable options for meals and groceries\n- Transportation, with lower prices for public transport and taxis\n- Utilities and internet, with more affordable options for basic services\n- **Georgia is cheaper for:**\n- Certain tourist attractions and activities, such as skiing and hiking\n- High-end accommodation and luxury services\n- International flights and travel options\n- Certain imported goods and products\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nFor expats, students, and retirees on a tight budget, Armenia offers a more affordable option for living and traveling.
