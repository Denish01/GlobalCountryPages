[SECTION] Overview: Armenia vs Georgia [/SECTION]
Armenia and Georgia are two neighboring countries in the Caucasus region, offering a unique blend of Eastern European and Middle Eastern culture. In terms of cost of living, Armenia is generally cheaper than Georgia, with a difference of around 15-20% in overall expenses. This is largely due to the fact that Armenia has a lower GDP per capita and a more limited economy, resulting in lower prices for goods and services. However, Georgia has a more developed tourism industry and a stronger economy, which can drive up prices in certain areas, such as accommodation and food.

The economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Armenia has a more limited job market and a lower average salary, which means that expats and foreigners may need to rely on external income sources. On the other hand, Georgia has a more developed economy and a growing tourism industry, which can provide more job opportunities and a higher standard of living. Overall, Armenia is a more affordable option for those on a tight budget, while Georgia offers a more comfortable lifestyle for those with a higher income.
