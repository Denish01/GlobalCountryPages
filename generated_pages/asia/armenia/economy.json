The country's economic development level is considered to be relatively low compared to other European and Central Asian countries. However, Armenia has made significant progress in recent years, with the economy growing at an average annual rate of around 4%. The country's economic classification is a mix of industrial and agricultural sectors, with a growing services sector. Armenia's economic trajectory is expected to continue on a positive path, driven by investments in infrastructure, tourism, and technology.\n\nArmenia's economy is heavily reliant on remittances from abroad, with many citizens working in countries such as Russia and the United States. The country is also rich in natural resources, including copper, gold, and molybdenum, which are major contributors to the economy. However, Armenia's economic growth is constrained by its limited access to international markets, due to its landlocked location and closed borders with Turkey and Azerbaijan.\n\nThe Armenian government has implemented various reforms to improve the business environment and attract foreign investment. These reforms include simplifying tax procedures, reducing bureaucracy, and improving the rule of law. As a result, Armenia has seen an increase in foreign investment in recent years, particularly in the technology and tourism sectors.\n\n[SECTION] Key Industries [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Industry | Contribution | Details |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Agriculture | 20% of GDP | Armenia is a major producer of fruits, vegetables, and grains, with a focus on export-oriented production |\n| Mining | 10% of GDP | Armenia is rich in copper, gold, and molybdenum, with several major mines operating in the country |\n| Manufacturing | 15% of GDP | Armenia has a growing manufacturing sector, with a focus on textiles, food processing, and construction materials |\n| Services | 40% of GDP | The services sector is the largest contributor to Armenia's economy, with a focus on finance, IT, and tourism |\n| Tourism | 5% of GDP | Armenia's tourism sector is growing rapidly, with a focus on cultural and historical tourism |\n| Technology | 5% of GDP | Armenia has a growing tech sector, with a focus on software development, IT services, and startups |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Trade Profile [/SECTION]\n**Top Exports:** \n- **Copper and copper products**, which account for around 20% of total exports\n- **Gold and gold products**, which account for around 15% of total exports\n- **Agricultural products**, such as fruits and vegetables, which account for around 10% of total exports\n- **Textiles and apparel**, which account for around 5% of total exports\n- **Machinery and electronics**, which account for around 5% of total exports\n\n**Top Imports:** \n- **Fuel and energy products**, which account for around 20% of total imports\n- **Machinery and electronics**, which account for around 15% of total imports\n- **Transportation vehicles**, which account for around 10% of total imports\n- **Food and agricultural products**, which account for around 10% of total imports\n- **Construction materials**, which account for around 5% of total imports\n\n**Key Trading Partners:** \n- Russia, which accounts for around 20% of total trade\n- China, which accounts for around 15% of total trade\n- Germany, which accounts for around 10% of total trade\n- United States, which accounts for around 5% of total trade\n- Georgia, which accounts for around 5% of total trade\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n- Armenia has a relatively well-developed transport network, with around 8,000 kilometers of roads and 850 kilometers of railways\n- The country has a growing energy sector, with a focus on renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power\n- Internet and mobile penetration are relatively high, with around 70% of the population having access to the internet and around 90% having access to mobile phones\n- Armenia has two major airports, Zvartnots International Airport and Shirak Airport, which serve as hubs for international trade and tourism\n- The country also has several major ports, including the Port of Poti in Georgia, which serves as a major transit point for trade with Europe and Asia\n\n[SECTION] Economic Outlook [/SECTION]\nArmenia's economic outlook is positive, with the country expected to continue growing at a rate of around 4-5% per year.
