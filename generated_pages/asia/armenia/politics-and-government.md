[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Armenia is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **executive branch** is headed by the Prime Minister, who is responsible for appointing ministers and overseeing the implementation of government policies. The **legislative branch**, known as the National Assembly, is a unicameral body composed of 105 members elected by proportional representation for a term of five years. The **judicial branch** is composed of the Constitutional Court, the Court of Cassation, and lower courts, and is responsible for interpreting the constitution and laws of the country. Armenia has a **unitary system**, where the central government has significant powers and the regions have limited autonomy.

The separation of powers in Armenia is designed to prevent any one branch of government from dominating the others. The National Assembly has the power to approve or reject the Prime Minister's appointments, and the Prime Minister has the power to dissolve the National Assembly and call for new elections. The judicial branch is independent and has the power to review the constitutionality of laws and government actions.

Armenia's **constitutional framework** is based on the principles of democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. The constitution, which was adopted in 1991 and amended in 2005 and 2015, establishes the framework for the government and the relationship between the government and citizens. It guarantees fundamental rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech, assembly, and association, and provides for an independent judiciary and a system of checks and balances.
