[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in Armenia is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be underfunded and understaffed, although it is free for citizens. Private healthcare providers, on the other hand, offer higher-quality care, but at a cost. In urban areas, such as the capital Yerevan, access to healthcare is generally good, with a range of public and private hospitals and clinics available. However, in rural areas, access to healthcare can be limited, with fewer facilities and less specialized care available. The quality of care can also vary significantly depending on the location and type of facility, with some hospitals and clinics offering high-quality care, while others may be more basic.

The Armenian government has been working to improve the healthcare system, with a focus on increasing funding and improving access to care, particularly in rural areas. However, there is still a significant gap between the quality of care available in urban and rural areas. Additionally, the healthcare system in Armenia is often characterized by a high level of **out-of-pocket payments**, which can be a significant burden for many citizens.

In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of private healthcare providers in Armenia, offering a range of specialized services, including **plastic surgery**, **dentistry**, and **cardiology**. These private providers often have more modern facilities and equipment, and may offer higher-quality care than public hospitals and clinics. However, they can also be more expensive, and may not be accessible to all citizens.
