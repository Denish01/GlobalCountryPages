  "content": "Armenia is governed as a **unitary parliamentary constitutional republic**, with a complex system of governance that involves a separation of powers between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nGovernment Type: Unitary Parliamentary Constitutional Republic\nHead of State: President, Vahagn Khachaturyan\nHead of Government: Prime Minister, Nikol Pashinyan\nLegislature: National Assembly, unicameral, 105 seats\nLegal System: Civil law\nPolitical Stability Index: Ranked 83 out of 178 countries in the 2022 Fragile States Index\nCorruption Index: Ranked 49 out of 180 countries in the 2022 Corruption Perceptions Index by Transparency International\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]\nThe government of Armenia is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **executive branch** is headed by the Prime Minister, who is responsible for appointing ministers and overseeing the implementation of government policies. The **legislative branch**, known as the National Assembly, is a unicameral body composed of 105 members elected by proportional representation for a term of five years. The **judicial branch** is composed of the Constitutional Court, the Court of Cassation, and lower courts, and is responsible for interpreting the constitution and laws of the country. Armenia has a **unitary system**, where the central government has significant powers and the regions have limited autonomy.\n\nThe separation of powers in Armenia is designed to prevent any one branch of government from dominating the others. The National Assembly has the power to approve or reject the Prime Minister's appointments, and the Prime Minister has the power to dissolve the National Assembly and call for new elections. The judicial branch is independent and has the power to review the constitutionality of laws and government actions.\n\nArmenia's **constitutional framework** is based on the principles of democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. The constitution, which was adopted in 1991 and amended in 2005 and 2015, establishes the framework for the government and the relationship between the government and citizens. It guarantees fundamental rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech, assembly, and association, and provides for an independent judiciary and a system of checks and balances.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | Office of the Prime Minister | Nikol Pashinyan | Head of Government, appoints ministers |\n| Executive | Office of the President | Vahagn Khachaturyan | Head of State, ceremonial role |\n| Legislative | National Assembly | Alen Simonyan | Unicameral legislature, approves laws and budget |\n| Judicial | Constitutional Court | Arman Dilanyan | Interprets constitution, reviews laws |\n| Judicial | Court of Cassation | Yervand Khundkaryan | Highest court of appeal, reviews lower court decisions |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Major Political Parties [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Party | Position | Leader | Seats | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Civil Contract Party | Center-left | Nikol Pashinyan | 71 | Ruling party, advocates for democratic reforms |\n| Armenia Alliance | Center-right | Robert Kocharyan | 29 | Opposition party, advocates for conservative policies |\n| I Have Honor Alliance | Nationalist | Artur Vanetsyan | 6 | Opposition party, advocates for nationalist policies |\n| Prosperous Armenia Party | Center-right | Gagik Tsarukyan | 0 | Opposition party, advocates for economic development |\n| Bright Armenia Party | Center-left | Edmon Marukyan | 0 | Opposition party, advocates for liberal policies |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Elections [/SECTION]\n- The electoral system in Armenia is based on proportional representation, where voters elect parties rather than individual candidates.\n- Elections are held every five years, with the most recent parliamentary election taking place in 2021.\n- The last presidential election was held in 2018, and the next presidential election is scheduled for 2025.\n- Voter participation in Armenia is relatively high, with over 50% of eligible voters participating in the 2021 parliamentary election.\n\n[SECTION] Political Stability & Challenges [/SECTION]\n- The current political climate in Armenia is characterized by a fragile stability, with ongoing tensions with neighboring countries, particularly Azerbaijan.\n- Key issues facing the government include economic development, corruption, and the ongoing conflict with Azerbaijan over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh.\n- Regional dynamics play a significant role in Armenia's politics, with the country seeking to balance its relationships with Russia, the European Union, and the United States.\n- Armenia's freedom indices are relatively high, with the country ranked 51st out of 180 countries in the 2022 Press Freedom Index and 46th out of 180 countries in the 2022 Human Freedom Index.\n- The government faces significant challenges in addressing the country's economic development, with Armenia ranked 47th out of 190 countries in the 2022 Ease of Doing Business Index.\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Relations [/SECTION]\n- Armenia is a member of the United Nations, the Council of Europe, and the Eurasian Economic Union.\n- The country has a strategic alliance with Russia, with which it has a mutual defense treaty and close economic ties.\n- Armenia is also a member of the European Union's Eastern Partnership program, which aims to promote economic and political cooperation between the EU and its eastern neighbors.\n- The country has a complex relationship with Turkey, with which it has a closed border and significant historical and cultural tensions.\n- Armenia is a member of the Collective Security Treaty Organization, a regional security alliance that includes Russia, Belarus, and several other former Soviet states.",
