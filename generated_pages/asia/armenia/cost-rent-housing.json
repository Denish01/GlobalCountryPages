Typical lease terms in Armenia are for 12 months, with a deposit requirement of one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are generally well-protected, with the law requiring landlords to provide a written contract and maintain the property in good condition. Compared to its regional neighbors, Armenia's housing costs are relatively low, making it an attractive option for those looking to live in the Caucasus region. However, prices can vary significantly depending on the location, with the capital city Yerevan tend to be more expensive than other parts of the country.\n\nThe Armenian government has implemented various initiatives to improve the housing market, including programs to support affordable housing and encourage foreign investment. As a result, the market is becoming increasingly attractive to expats and locals alike, with a range of new developments and renovations taking place in recent years. Despite this, the market can still be challenging to navigate, particularly for those who do not speak Armenian. It is essential to work with a reputable real estate agent or property manager to find the right accommodation and ensure a smooth transition.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $250-$400 | $150-$300 | Typically small, 20-40 sqm |\n| 1 Bedroom | $300-$500 | $200-$350 | What to expect: 40-60 sqm, basic amenities |\n| 2 Bedroom | $450-$700 | $300-$500 | Family size: 60-100 sqm, more amenities |\n| 3 Bedroom | $600-$1,000 | $450-$700 | Spacious: 100-150 sqm, high-end finishes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $1,500-$3,000 | Prime locations, high demand |\n| Suburbs | $1,000-$2,000 | Residential areas, more affordable |\n| Rural | $500-$1,000 | If applicable, limited amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- Kentron: $300-$500 per month, central location, vibrant nightlife\n- Arabkir: $250-$400 per month, family-friendly, amenities nearby\n- Davtashen: $200-$350 per month, residential area, parks and green spaces\n- Malatia-Sebastia: $250-$400 per month, historic neighborhood, cultural attractions\n- Nor Nork: $200-$350 per month, upscale area, modern amenities\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Armenia [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods thoroughly to find the best fit for your budget and lifestyle\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent or property manager to navigate the market\n- Inspect the property carefully before signing a lease to ensure it is in good condition\n- Negotiate the price and terms of the lease, as this is common practice in Armenia\n- Be aware of scams and ensure you are working with a legitimate agent or landlord\n- Utilities such as electricity, water, and gas are typically not included in the rent, so factor these costs into your budget\n- Furnished apartments are less common than unfurnished, so be prepared to provide your own furniture and appliances if needed",
