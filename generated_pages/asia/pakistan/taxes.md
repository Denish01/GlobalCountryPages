[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Pakistan has a **territorial taxation** system, where individuals and companies are taxed on their income earned within the country, regardless of their nationality or residence status. However, residents are also subject to tax on their worldwide income, with certain exemptions and deductions available. The **residency rules** for tax purposes in Pakistan are based on the number of days an individual spends in the country, with residents defined as those who spend more than 183 days in a tax year.

The tax system in Pakistan is administered by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), which is responsible for collecting taxes, including income tax, sales tax, and federal excise duty. The FBR also provides guidance and support to taxpayers, including expats and foreign workers, to help them comply with their tax obligations. Understanding the tax system and residency rules is essential for individuals and companies to navigate the complex tax landscape in Pakistan and avoid any potential penalties or fines.
