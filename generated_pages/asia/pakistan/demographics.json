  "content": "The population of Pakistan is approximately 241 million people, with a diverse range of ethnic, linguistic, and religious groups that shape the country's demographics.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nTotal Population: (241 million)\nPopulation Growth Rate: (2.1%)\nMedian Age: (22.8 years)\nUrban Population: (36.2%)\nPopulation Density: (304 per km2)\nLife Expectancy: (66.1 years)\nFertility Rate: (3.6 children per woman)\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]\nPakistan has the fifth-largest population in the world, with an estimated 241 million people as of the latest available estimates. The country's population has been growing at a rate of 2.1% per annum, which is higher than the global average. This rapid growth has put pressure on the country's resources, infrastructure, and social services. Pakistan's population is also experiencing a significant shift towards urbanization, with approximately 36.2% of the population living in urban areas. The country's population is expected to continue growing, with projections suggesting that it will reach 300 million by 2050.\n\nThe population of Pakistan is also characterized by a high total fertility rate, with an average of 3.6 children per woman. This is higher than the replacement rate of 2.1 children per woman, which is the rate at which a population replaces itself from one generation to the next. The high fertility rate in Pakistan is due to a combination of factors, including limited access to family planning services, cultural and social norms that favor large families, and a lack of education and economic opportunities for women.\n\nPakistan's population is also experiencing significant migration patterns, both within the country and internationally. Many Pakistanis migrate to other countries in search of work, education, and better living standards, with popular destinations including the Middle East, Europe, and North America. Within the country, there are also significant migration patterns, with many people moving from rural areas to urban centers in search of employment and better living standards.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Punjabis | 44.7% | Punjab province | Largest ethnic group in Pakistan |\n| Pashtuns | 15.4% | Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan provinces | Second-largest ethnic group in Pakistan |\n| Sindhis | 14.1% | Sindh province | Third-largest ethnic group in Pakistan |\n| Saraikis | 10.5% | Punjab province | Significant minority group in southern Punjab |\n| Muhajirs | 7.6% | Urban areas, particularly Karachi | Urdu-speaking community that migrated from India during partition |\n| Baloch | 3.6% | Balochistan province | Significant minority group in southwestern Pakistan |\n| Hazara | 2.3% | Quetta and other urban areas | Minority group that has faced significant persecution and violence |\n\nPakistan is a culturally and linguistically diverse country, with a range of ethnic groups that have their own distinct customs, traditions, and languages.
