  "content": "Healthcare in Pakistan is a mixed system that includes both public and private providers, with varying levels of quality and accessibility across the country.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nQuality Rating: 2/5\nEmergency Number: 1122\nHospital Standard: Basic\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: widespread\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nPakistan's healthcare system is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public sector is the primary provider of healthcare services, especially in rural areas, but it is often underfunded and understaffed. The private sector, on the other hand, offers high-quality care, but it is expensive and out of reach for many Pakistanis. The quality of care varies significantly depending on the location, with urban areas generally having better-equipped and better-staffed hospitals than rural areas. Despite efforts to improve healthcare, Pakistan still faces significant challenges, including a shortage of healthcare professionals, inadequate infrastructure, and limited access to healthcare services, especially in rural areas.\n\nThe public healthcare system in Pakistan is free, but it is often overcrowded and underfunded, leading to long wait times and limited access to specialized care. In contrast, private hospitals offer high-quality care, but they are expensive, and many Pakistanis cannot afford them. The government has implemented various initiatives to improve healthcare, including the introduction of **health insurance schemes** and **public-private partnerships**. However, more needs to be done to address the significant healthcare challenges facing the country.\n\nThe urban-rural divide is a significant issue in Pakistan's healthcare system, with rural areas having limited access to healthcare services, including specialized care and emergency services. The government has implemented initiatives to improve healthcare in rural areas, including the deployment of **community health workers** and the establishment of **rural health centers**. However, more needs to be done to address the significant healthcare disparities between urban and rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Aga Khan University Hospital | Karachi | Private | Cardiology, Oncology, Neurosurgery | Yes |\n| Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital | Lahore | Private | Oncology | Yes |\n| Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences | Islamabad | Public | General Medicine, Surgery, Pediatrics | Limited |\n| Liaquat National Hospital | Karachi | Private | Cardiology, Neurology, Orthopedics | Yes |\n| Shifa International Hospital | Islamabad | Private | General Medicine, Surgery, Cardiology | Yes |\n| Combined Military Hospital | Rawalpindi | Public | General Medicine, Surgery, Orthopedics | Limited |\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Private health insurance** is recommended for foreigners and affluent Pakistanis, as it offers access to high-quality private hospitals and specialized care.\n- **Local insurance options** are available, including **Adamjee Health Insurance** and **Jubilee Life Insurance**, which offer a range of health insurance plans.\n- **Coverage for expats** is available through international insurance companies, such as **Allianz** and **AXA**, which offer global health insurance plans.\n- **Costs** vary depending on the insurance plan and provider, but expect to pay between 50,000 to 200,000 PKR per year for a basic health insurance plan.\n- **Government-sponsored health insurance** is available for low-income families and vulnerable populations, including **Sehat Sahulat Program** and **Prime Minister's National Health Program**.\n- **Self-payment** is common in Pakistan, especially in rural areas, where access to health insurance is limited.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Medications** are widely available in Pakistan, including **prescription medications** and **over-the-counter medications**.\n- **Prescription requirements** vary depending on the medication, but a prescription from a licensed doctor is generally required for prescription medications.\n- **Common brands** include **GlaxoSmithKline**, **Pfizer**, and **Merck**, which are widely available in Pakistan.\n- **Costs** vary depending on the medication and brand, but expect to pay between 100 to 1,000 PKR for a basic medication.\n- **Pharmacy access** is widespread, with pharmacies available in most urban and rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Required vaccinations** include **Hepatitis A**, **Hepatitis B**, and **Typhoid**, which are recommended for all travelers to Pakistan.\n- **Recommended vaccinations** include **Rabies**, **Meningitis**, and **Influenza**, which are recommended for travelers who will be spending time in rural areas or working with animals.\n- **Endemic diseases** include **Malaria**, **Dengue fever**, and **Chikungunya**, which are prevalent in certain parts of the country.\n- **Water safety** is a concern in Pakistan, with **water-borne illnesses** such as **Cholera** and **Diarrhea** common in rural areas.\n- **Food safety** is also a concern, with **food-borne illnesses** such as **Salmonella** and **E. coli** common in urban areas.\n- **Air pollution** is a significant health risk in Pakistan, especially in urban areas, with **respiratory problems** such as **Asthma** and **Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)** common.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **Medical tourism** is a growing industry in Pakistan, with many foreigners coming to the country for **low-cost medical procedures**.\n- **Popular procedures** include **cosmetic surgery**, **dentistry**, and **orthopedic surgery**, which are available at a lower cost than in many Western countries.\n- **Accredited hospitals** include **Aga Khan University Hospital** and **Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital**, which offer high-quality medical care and specialized procedures.\n- **Cost savings** can be significant, with medical procedures often costing 50-70% less than in Western countries.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- **Emergency number** is 1122, which is available 24/7 and offers emergency medical services, including ambulance transport and emergency care.\n- **Ambulance reliability** varies depending on the location, but ambulances are generally available in urban areas.\n- **Nearest hospitals** can be found by calling the emergency number or asking locals for directions.\n- **Insurance claims** can be filed with the insurance provider, but expect to pay out-of-pocket for emergency services and then file a claim for reimbursement.\n- **Emergency care** is available at most hospitals, including public and private hospitals, but the quality of care can vary significantly depending on the hospital and location.",
