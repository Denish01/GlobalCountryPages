  "content": "The cost of utilities and internet in Pakistan can vary depending on the location and usage, but on average, a monthly utility bill for an 85 sqm apartment can range from $50 to $150 USD.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Utilities (85 sqm apt): ($100 USD)\nInternet (60 Mbps): ($20 USD/month)\nMobile Data (10GB): ($5 USD/month)\nElectricity Cost: ($0.12 per kWh)\nCurrency: PKR\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nPakistan's utility infrastructure has undergone significant improvements in recent years, with a focus on increasing access to electricity, water, and gas. However, the costs of these utilities can fluctuate due to various factors such as seasonal variation, inflation, and government policies. For example, electricity costs tend to be higher during the summer months due to increased demand for air conditioning. Additionally, the inflation rate of 12.6% in 2024 may impact the prices of utilities, making it essential for consumers to budget accordingly.\n\nThe quality of utility infrastructure in Pakistan varies across different regions, with urban areas generally having better access to amenities like electricity, water, and gas. However, rural areas often face challenges in accessing these basic necessities. The government has launched initiatives to improve the utility infrastructure, including the introduction of smart meters and the expansion of the national grid. Despite these efforts, utility costs can still be a significant burden for many households, especially those with limited incomes. With a GDP per capita PPP of $6,252, many Pakistanis have to allocate a substantial portion of their budget to utility bills.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $30 | $50 | $70 | rates vary by season |\n| Water | $10 | $15 | $20 | metered usage |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $15 | $20 | mostly used for cooking |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $5 | $5 | $5 | included in municipal taxes |\n| **Total** | **$55** | **$85** | **$115** |  |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $10-20 | 10-30 Mbps | PTCL, Jazz |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $20-50 | 60-100 Mbps | PTCL, Jazz, StormFiber |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $2-5 | 1-10 GB | Jazz, Zong, Ufone |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $5-10 | 10-50 GB | Jazz, Zong, Ufone |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $20-50 | varies | PTCL, Jazz |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $8 | available in Pakistan |\n| Spotify (premium) | $5 | available in Pakistan |\n| Local Streaming | $3 | services like Tapmad, See Prime |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities, it's best to contact the local service providers, such as PTCL for internet and electricity, and Sui Gas for gas connections.\n- Prepaid electricity meters can help consumers manage their usage and avoid unexpected bills, especially for those with limited incomes.\n- For internet, consider opting for a fiber connection, which offers faster speeds and more reliable connectivity, with providers like PTCL and Jazz being popular options.\n- To save on utility bills, consumers can take measures such as using energy-efficient appliances, turning off lights and electronics when not in use, and using public transport or carpooling to reduce fuel consumption.\n- It's also essential to regularly review and compare utility plans to ensure you're getting the best deals, and to take advantage of any promotions or discounts offered by service providers.",
