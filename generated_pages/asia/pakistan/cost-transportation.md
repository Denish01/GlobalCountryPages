[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Pakistan has a diverse range of transportation options, including buses, taxis, rickshaws, and ride-hailing services. The quality of public transit varies greatly between cities, with larger cities like Karachi and Lahore having more comprehensive systems. Most people in Pakistan get around using a combination of these modes, with many opting for affordable and widely available options like buses and rickshaws. However, the lack of a well-developed public transportation system in some areas can make it difficult for people to get around, especially in rural areas.

In general, the transportation infrastructure in Pakistan is still developing, and there is a need for improvement in terms of safety, efficiency, and accessibility. Despite these challenges, many cities in Pakistan have made significant progress in recent years, with the introduction of new bus systems and the expansion of ride-hailing services. Additionally, the government has invested in improving the country's road network, which has helped to reduce travel times and increase connectivity between cities.
