[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Pakistan is located in South Asia, bordering the Arabian Sea to the south. The country is situated in a strategic position, with the **Himalayan Mountains** to the east, the **Karakoram** range to the north, and the **Sulaiman Range** to the west. Pakistan shares its borders with four countries: India to the east, China to the northeast, Afghanistan to the northwest, and Iran to the southwest. The country's unique geography has played a significant role in shaping its history, culture, and economy.

Pakistan's location at the crossroads of South Asia, the Middle East, and Central Asia has made it an important center for trade and cultural exchange. The country's borders are marked by several important mountain passes, including the **Khyber Pass**, which connects Pakistan to Afghanistan, and the **Khunjerab Pass**, which connects Pakistan to China. The Arabian Sea coastline provides Pakistan with a significant maritime boundary, with several major ports, including the **Port of Karachi**, which is the country's largest port.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Pakistan's terrain is diverse and complex, with several distinct regions. The **Himalayan Mountains** in the north are home to some of the world's highest peaks, including **K2**, the second-highest mountain in the world. The **Karakoram** range is known for its rugged terrain, with steep cliffs, glaciers, and snow-capped peaks. The **Sulaiman Range** in the west is a smaller mountain range, but still features several significant peaks. The **Indus River**, which flows through the center of the country, is the longest river in Pakistan and provides water for irrigation, drinking, and hydroelectric power.

In addition to its mountainous regions, Pakistan also has several deserts, including the **Thar Desert** in the southeast and the **Cholistan Desert** in the southwest. The **Punjab Plain**, which surrounds the Indus River, is a fertile region that is home to much of Pakistan's agricultural production. The **coastal region** of Pakistan is a narrow strip of land that runs along the Arabian Sea, with several major ports and cities, including Karachi and Gwadar. Pakistan's diverse terrain and landscape support a wide range of ecosystems, including forests, grasslands, and wetlands.

The country's terrain has also played a significant role in shaping its climate, with the **Himalayan Mountains** blocking cold air from the north and the **Arabian Sea** providing moisture to the southern regions. The combination of these factors has created a unique and varied climate in Pakistan, with several distinct regions and microclimates. From the cold, snowy peaks of the **Karakoram** to the hot, dry deserts of the **Thar**, Pakistan's terrain and landscape are incredibly diverse and complex.
