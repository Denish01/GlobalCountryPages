        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Pakistan gained independence from British colonial rule on August 14, 1947. The country was formed as a result of the <strong>Partition of India</strong>, which divided British India into two separate countries: India and Pakistan. The partition was based on the <strong>Two-Nation Theory</strong>, which held that Hindus and Muslims were two separate nations with distinct cultures and histories. The new country was composed of two wings: East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) and West Pakistan (now Pakistan). The country's early years were marked by significant challenges, including the integration of <strong>princely states</strong> and the establishment of a new government.</p>
        <p>The <strong>Indian Independence Act of 1947</strong> granted independence to both India and Pakistan, with the British monarch serving as the head of state until 1956, when Pakistan became a republic. The country's first constitution was adopted in 1956, but it was short-lived, and the country experienced a series of military coups and periods of martial law. In 1971, East Pakistan seceded from Pakistan and became the independent country of Bangladesh after a brutal civil war. Since then, Pakistan has continued to face significant challenges, including political instability, economic development, and regional conflicts.</p>
        <p>Pakistan's history is also marked by its strategic location, with the country serving as a crossroads between <strong>South Asia</strong>, <strong>Central Asia</strong>, and the <strong>Middle East</strong>. The country's geography has played a significant role in shaping its history, with the <strong>Khyber Pass</strong> and the <strong>Bolan Pass</strong> serving as important trade routes between India and Central Asia. The country's cultural heritage is also diverse, with influences from <strong>Islamic</strong>, <strong>Persian</strong>, and <strong>South Asian</strong> traditions.</p>
        <p>The country's early years were also marked by significant migration, with millions of Muslims migrating from India to Pakistan and millions of Hindus migrating from Pakistan to India. This migration had a profound impact on the country's demographics and culture, with the country becoming one of the largest Muslim-majority countries in the world. Today, Pakistan is a <strong>sovereign state</strong> with a diverse population and a rich cultural heritage.</p>
