[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Pakistan has several international airports, with the main ones being Islamabad International Airport, Jinnah International Airport in Karachi, and Lahore Allama Iqbal International Airport. These airports receive direct flights from major hubs in the Middle East, Europe, and Asia, including Dubai, Abu Dhabi, London, and Bangkok. You can also enter Pakistan overland from neighboring countries, with the most common entry points being the border crossings with India, China, Afghanistan, and Iran. The most popular overland route is the Karakoram Highway, which connects Pakistan to China and offers breathtaking scenery and challenging road conditions.

If you're planning to enter Pakistan by land, be sure to research the current border crossing requirements and regulations, as they can change frequently. You may need to obtain a visa on arrival or in advance, depending on your nationality, and you should also be prepared for potential delays and security checks. Additionally, consider hiring a reputable guide or joining a tour group to help navigate the border crossing process and ensure a smooth journey.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Pakistan has an extensive domestic air network, with several airlines operating flights between major cities. The main domestic airlines are Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), Airblue, and Serene Air, which offer frequent flights between cities like Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, and Peshawar. You can book domestic flights online or through a travel agent, and prices vary depending on the route and time of year, with approximate costs ranging from $50 to $200 for a one-way ticket. It's a good idea to book in advance to secure the best rates, especially during peak travel seasons.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Pakistan's rail network is moderate, with several main lines connecting major cities. The most popular routes are the Karachi-Lahore and Lahore-Peshawar lines, which offer a relatively comfortable and scenic way to travel. However, the rail network is not as extensive as in some other countries, and trains can be delayed or cancelled due to various reasons. There are no high-speed train options available, but some trains have air-conditioned compartments and onboard meal services. You can book train tickets online or at the station, and prices vary depending on the class and route, with approximate costs ranging from $10 to $50 for a one-way ticket.

Bus travel can be a convenient and affordable way to get around, with prices starting from around $5 for a one-way ticket.
