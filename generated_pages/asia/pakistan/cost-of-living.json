[/SECTION]\nPakistan is considered an affordable country to live in or visit, with a low cost of living compared to global averages. The country's economy is largely driven by agriculture, manufacturing, and remittances from overseas workers. Compared to its neighbors, Pakistan is generally cheaper than India and China, but more expensive than Afghanistan and Iran. The cost of living in Pakistan can vary depending on the city, with major cities like Karachi and Lahore tend to be more expensive than smaller towns and rural areas. Overall, Pakistan offers a great value for travelers and expats looking for an affordable and culturally rich experience.\n\nPakistan's affordability is due in part to its low labor costs, which keep prices for goods and services relatively low. Additionally, the country has a large and vibrant informal economy, which provides a range of affordable options for food, transportation, and other necessities. However, it's worth noting that prices can vary depending on the location and the type of establishment, with high-end restaurants and hotels catering to foreigners and wealthy locals tend to be more expensive.\n\n[SECTION] Accommodation Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Price Range (USD/night) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Hostel/Budget | $5-15 | basic dorms and guesthouses |\n| Mid-Range Hotel | $20-50 | comfortable hotels with amenities |\n| Luxury/Resort | $100-250 | high-end hotels and resorts |\n| Apartment Rent (monthly) | $100-500 | city center vs outside, 1-3 bedrooms |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $1-3 |\n| Casual Restaurant | $5-10 |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $15-30 |\n| Fine Dining | $30-50 |\n| Beer (local) | $2-5 |\n| Coffee | $1-3 |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $0.50-1.50 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport | Cost (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Local bus/metro ride | $0.20-0.50 |\n| Taxi (per km) | $0.50-1.00 |\n| Domestic flight | $50-150 |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $0.50-1.00 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Breakdown [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Category | Budget ($) | Mid-Range ($) | Comfortable ($) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rent | 100-300 | 300-600 | 800-1500 |\n| Food | 150-300 | 300-600 | 600-1200 |\n| Transport | 50-100 | 100-200 | 200-300 |\n| Utilities | 50-100 | 100-200 | 200-300 |\n| Entertainment | 100-200 | 200-400 | 400-600 |\n| **Total** | **550-1200** | **1200-2400** | **2800-4500** |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Money-Saving Tips [/SECTION]\n- Consider staying in budget-friendly accommodations, such as guesthouses or hostels, which can be found for as low as $5-10 per night.\n- Eat at local eateries or street food stalls, which offer delicious and affordable meals for as low as $1-3 per meal.\n- Use public transportation, such as buses or rickshaws, which are inexpensive and convenient.\n- Avoid traveling during peak season (June to August) when prices for accommodations and transportation tend to be higher.\n- Learn some basic Urdu phrases, such as \"hello\" (assalamu alaikum) and \"thank you\" (shukriya), which can go a long way in getting better prices and service.\n- Haggle when shopping at markets or from street vendors, as prices are often negotiable.",
