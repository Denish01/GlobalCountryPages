# Pakistan Visa & Entry Requirements

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Pakistan before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Pakistan has a moderate visa policy, with a mix of visa-free access, visa on arrival, and required visas for different nationalities. Currently, citizens of around 50 countries can enter Pakistan visa-free or obtain a visa on arrival, while others need to apply for a visa in advance. The country has been working to relax its visa rules to promote tourism and trade, especially with neighboring countries and strategic partners.

The government of Pakistan has introduced an electronic visa system, which allows citizens of eligible countries to apply for a visa online. This has streamlined the process and made it easier for tourists and business travelers to visit the country. However, the requirements and regulations can still be complex, and it's essential to check with the official authorities for the latest information.
