[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Pakistan's healthcare system is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public sector is the primary provider of healthcare services, especially in rural areas, but it is often underfunded and understaffed. The private sector, on the other hand, offers high-quality care, but it is expensive and out of reach for many Pakistanis. The quality of care varies significantly depending on the location, with urban areas generally having better-equipped and better-staffed hospitals than rural areas. Despite efforts to improve healthcare, Pakistan still faces significant challenges, including a shortage of healthcare professionals, inadequate infrastructure, and limited access to healthcare services, especially in rural areas.

The public healthcare system in Pakistan is free, but it is often overcrowded and underfunded, leading to long wait times and limited access to specialized care. In contrast, private hospitals offer high-quality care, but they are expensive, and many Pakistanis cannot afford them. The government has implemented various initiatives to improve healthcare, including the introduction of **health insurance schemes** and **public-private partnerships**. However, more needs to be done to address the significant healthcare challenges facing the country.

The urban-rural divide is a significant issue in Pakistan's healthcare system, with rural areas having limited access to healthcare services, including specialized care and emergency services. The government has implemented initiatives to improve healthcare in rural areas, including the deployment of **community health workers** and the establishment of **rural health centers**. However, more needs to be done to address the significant healthcare disparities between urban and rural areas.
