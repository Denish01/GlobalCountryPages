  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Pakistan can vary significantly, with public healthcare services being generally more affordable but often lacking in quality, while private healthcare services can be expensive but offer better quality and facilities.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $30 (2023)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 52.9% (2023)\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 1122\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: PKR\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nPakistan's healthcare system is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, resulting in a lack of quality and availability of services, particularly in rural areas. In contrast, private healthcare providers offer high-quality services, but at a cost that is often out of reach for the average Pakistani citizen. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only option, while foreigners and those who can afford it tend to opt for private healthcare services. It is recommended that foreigners and expats have health insurance to cover the costs of private healthcare services.\n\nThe healthcare system in Pakistan is also often plagued by issues such as corruption, lack of transparency, and inadequate regulation, which can make it difficult for patients to access quality care. Additionally, there is a significant shortage of qualified healthcare professionals, particularly in rural areas, which can exacerbate the existing healthcare challenges. Despite these challenges, there are some excellent private hospitals and medical facilities in major cities such as Karachi, Lahore, and Islamabad, which offer high-quality care and facilities.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $5-10 | $20-50 | |\n| Specialist Consultation | $10-20 | $50-100 | |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-20 | $30-50 | |\n| Eye Exam | $10-20 | $20-30 | |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $5-10 | $10-20 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $20-50 | |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $50-100 | |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-1,000 | |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $500-1,000 | |\n| MRI Scan | $100-200 | |\n| X-Ray | $10-20 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-50 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, basic procedures |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-200 | Specialist consultations, surgeries, hospital stays, and more |\n| International / Expat | $200-500 | Global coverage, evacuation services, and comprehensive medical care |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Common medications such as **antibiotics** and **painkillers** can cost between $5-10 per prescription\n- **Prescription medications** are widely available at pharmacies, but may require a doctor's prescription\n- **Pharmacies** are readily available in urban areas, but may be scarce in rural areas\n- **Over-the-counter medications** are widely available and often do not require a prescription\n- **Vaccinations** are available at public health clinics and private hospitals, but may require a prescription or consultation\n- **Medication prices** can vary significantly depending on the brand, quality, and availability of the medication\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the local emergency number, 1122, or seek immediate attention at a nearby hospital.
