[SECTION] How Expensive Is Pakistan? [/SECTION]
Pakistan is considered an affordable country to live in or visit, with a low cost of living compared to global averages. The country's economy is largely driven by agriculture, manufacturing, and remittances from overseas workers. Compared to its neighbors, Pakistan is generally cheaper than India and China, but more expensive than Afghanistan and Iran. The cost of living in Pakistan can vary depending on the city, with major cities like Karachi and Lahore tend to be more expensive than smaller towns and rural areas. Overall, Pakistan offers a great value for travelers and expats looking for an affordable and culturally rich experience.

Pakistan's affordability is due in part to its low labor costs, which keep prices for goods and services relatively low. Additionally, the country has a large and vibrant informal economy, which provides a range of affordable options for food, transportation, and other necessities. However, it's worth noting that prices can vary depending on the location and the type of establishment, with high-end restaurants and hotels catering to foreigners and wealthy locals tend to be more expensive.
