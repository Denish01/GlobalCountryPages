However, the internet quality and speed can vary greatly depending on the location, with urban areas generally having better connectivity and faster speeds than rural areas. The average internet speed in Pakistan is around 7.4 Mbps, which is relatively slow compared to other countries in the region. Despite this, the internet is generally reliable, with most providers offering a stable connection, although outages can occur, especially during periods of heavy usage or maintenance.\n\nThe urban-rural divide is a significant issue in Pakistan, with many rural areas lacking access to reliable and fast internet. This can make it difficult for people in these areas to access online services, communicate with others, and access information. However, the government and private sector are working to improve internet connectivity in rural areas, with initiatives such as the **National Broadband Policy** aiming to increase internet penetration and improve speeds. Additionally, many mobile operators are expanding their networks to cover more rural areas, which is helping to bridge the gap in internet access.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nGetting a SIM card in Pakistan is relatively easy, with many providers offering tourist-friendly plans. The main carriers, including **Jazz**, **Zong**, and **Telenor**, offer a range of plans, including prepaid and postpaid options. To get a SIM card, you will typically need to provide your passport and a photocopy of your visa, as well as fill out a registration form. You can buy SIM cards at most mobile operator stores, as well as at many retail outlets and markets. It's recommended to buy a SIM card from a official store or authorized retailer to ensure that you get a genuine SIM card and to avoid any potential scams.\n\nThe cost of a SIM card can vary depending on the provider and the plan you choose, but you can expect to pay around 5-10 USD for a tourist SIM. Data plans are also relatively affordable, with many providers offering packages that include a set amount of data, as well as voice and SMS minutes. It's a good idea to check the coverage and speeds of different providers before choosing a SIM card, as well as to read reviews and ask for recommendations from other travelers.\n\n[TABLE]\n| Carrier | Tourist Plan | Data | Price (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Jazz | Tourist SIM | 5GB | 10 | Includes 100 minutes and 100 SMS |\n| Zong | Zong 4G | 10GB | 15 | Includes 200 minutes and 200 SMS |\n| Telenor | Telenor Talkshawk | 3GB | 5 | Includes 50 minutes and 50 SMS |\n| Ufone | Ufone Super Card | 5GB | 10 | Includes 100 minutes and 100 SMS |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] WiFi Availability [/SECTION]\n- Hotel WiFi is generally available in most mid-range and high-end hotels, with speeds ranging from 2-10 Mbps.\n- Cafe WiFi culture is growing in Pakistan, with many cafes and coffee shops offering free WiFi to customers, although speeds can be slow.\n- Coworking spaces are becoming increasingly popular in major cities, with many offering high-speed WiFi and other amenities.\n- Public WiFi is limited, but some cities have introduced free public WiFi initiatives, such as the **Islamabad WiFi** project.\n- Many restaurants and shopping malls also offer free WiFi, although speeds can be slow and coverage can be limited.\n\n[SECTION] For Remote Workers [/SECTION]\n- Coworking spaces are a good option for remote workers, with many offering high-speed WiFi, meeting rooms, and other amenities.\n- Reliable cafe chains, such as **Gloria Jeans** and **Butler's Cafe**, offer free WiFi and a comfortable working environment.\n- Backup internet options, such as mobile hotspots and portable WiFi devices, can be useful in case of internet outages or slow speeds.\n- VPNs are recommended for remote workers, as they can help to secure your internet connection and protect your data.\n- Many hotels and guesthouses also offer coworking spaces and other facilities for remote workers, such as meeting rooms and printing services.\n\n[SECTION] Tips & Warnings [/SECTION]\n- Internet censorship is a significant issue in Pakistan, with many websites and online services blocked, including **YouTube** and **Facebook**.\n- Some online services, such as **Google Drive** and **Dropbox**, may be slow or unavailable due to internet censorship.\n- VPNs can help to bypass internet censorship and secure your internet connection, but may be blocked by some providers.\n- Roaming alternatives, such as portable WiFi devices and mobile hotspots, can be useful for travelers who need to stay connected.\n- eSIM options are limited in Pakistan, but some providers, such as **Jazz**, offer eSIM plans for certain devices.",
