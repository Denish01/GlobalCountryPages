[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Pakistan is divided into public and private sectors, with a significant difference in quality between the two. Public schools are generally underfunded and understaffed, resulting in a lower quality of education, while private schools are often better equipped and staffed, but also more expensive. The language of instruction in most schools is **Urdu**, although **English** is also widely used, especially in private schools. Compulsory education in Pakistan lasts for 12 years, from age 5 to 17, and is divided into primary, middle, and secondary levels. International schools are also available, especially in larger cities like **Islamabad** and **Karachi**, offering a range of curricula, including the **International Baccalaureate** and **British GCSE**.

The quality of education in Pakistan is a major concern, with many public schools struggling to provide even basic facilities, such as clean water and sanitation. In contrast, private schools and international schools often have better facilities and more qualified teachers, but are also much more expensive. This has resulted in a significant gap in educational outcomes between the rich and the poor, with many students from disadvantaged backgrounds struggling to access quality education. Despite these challenges, there are many excellent schools in Pakistan, both public and private, that offer high-quality education and a range of extracurricular activities.
