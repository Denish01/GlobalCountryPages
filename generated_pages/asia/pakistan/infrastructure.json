  "content": "Pakistan's infrastructure is a mix of modern and outdated systems, with significant investments being made in recent years to improve the country's transportation, energy, and telecommunications networks. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 74% of population\nInternet Penetration: 34%\nRoad Network: 263,775 km, variable quality with some well-maintained highways and poorly maintained rural roads\nRail Network: 7,791 km\nMajor Airports: 32\nMajor Ports: 2\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nPakistan's infrastructure development level is still in the process of catching up with the rest of the world, with a significant gap between urban and rural areas. The country has made notable investments in recent years, particularly in the transportation sector, with the development of new highways, motorways, and rail links. However, much work remains to be done, especially in rural areas where access to basic services such as electricity, clean water, and sanitation is still limited. The government has launched several initiatives to improve the infrastructure, including the **China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)**, a massive project aimed at upgrading the country's transportation network, energy systems, and industrial infrastructure.\n\nThe urban-rural gap in infrastructure development is a significant challenge in Pakistan, with cities like **Karachi** and **Lahore** having relatively well-developed infrastructure, while rural areas struggle with basic services. The government has recognized this issue and is working to address it through targeted investments in rural infrastructure. Despite these challenges, Pakistan has made significant progress in recent years, with improvements in electricity generation, transportation networks, and telecommunications.\n\nPakistan's infrastructure development is also hindered by a lack of investment in maintenance and upkeep, which can lead to a decline in the quality of existing infrastructure. However, with the help of international partners and foreign investment, the country is working to address these challenges and develop a more modern and efficient infrastructure network.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 263,775 km | Variable, with some well-maintained highways and poorly maintained rural roads | Includes 12,000 km of highways and motorways |\n| Railways | 7,791 km | Moderate, with some modernized sections and outdated equipment | Includes passenger and freight services |\n| Airports | 32 international and domestic | Good, with modern facilities at major airports | Includes **Jinnah International Airport** in Karachi and **Allama Iqbal International Airport** in Lahore |\n| Ports | 2 major, including **Port of Karachi** and **Port of Qasim** | Good, with modern facilities and equipment | Handles significant amounts of cargo and container traffic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- Pakistan's power generation mix is dominated by **thermal power plants**, which account for around 60% of total generation.\n- The country is working to increase its use of **renewable energy sources**, including wind and solar power, with a target of 20% of total generation by 2025.\n- **Power outages** are still a common problem in Pakistan, particularly during peak summer months, although the situation has improved in recent years.\n- The government has launched several initiatives to improve the energy sector, including the development of new power plants and transmission lines.\n- **Energy efficiency** is also a key focus area, with efforts to reduce energy consumption and promote the use of energy-efficient appliances and technologies.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water safety** is a significant concern in Pakistan, with many households relying on alternative sources of water due to concerns over quality and safety.\n- **Sanitation coverage** is also a challenge, particularly in rural areas where access to modern sanitation facilities is limited.\n- The government has launched several initiatives to improve **water access** in rural areas, including the development of new water supply schemes and sanitation facilities.\n- **Water conservation** is also a key focus area, with efforts to reduce water waste and promote the use of water-efficient technologies.\n- **Wastewater treatment** is another area of concern, with many cities and towns lacking adequate facilities to treat wastewater and protect the environment.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is widespread in Pakistan, with all major cities and towns having access to mobile phone services.\n- **Fiber-optic broadband** is also available in many areas, although coverage is still limited in rural areas.\n- The **4G/5G rollout** is ongoing in Pakistan, with several mobile operators launching 4G services in recent years and plans to launch 5G services in the near future.\n- **Postal services** are also available in Pakistan, with a network of post offices and mail delivery services across the country.\n- **Internet penetration** is still relatively low in Pakistan, although it has been increasing in recent years, particularly among young people and in urban areas.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The **China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)** is a major development project aimed at upgrading Pakistan's transportation network, energy systems, and industrial infrastructure.\n- The **Karachi-Lahore Motorway** is a significant transportation project that will improve road connectivity between the two cities.\n- The **Dasu Hydropower Project** is a major energy project that will increase Pakistan's power generation capacity and reduce its reliance on thermal power plants.\n- The **Sukkur-Multan Motorway** is another significant transportation project that will improve road connectivity in the southern region of the country.\n- The **Pakistan Railway Upgradation Project** is a major project aimed at modernizing the country's rail network and improving freight and passenger services.",
