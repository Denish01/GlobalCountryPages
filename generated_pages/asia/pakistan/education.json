  "content": "The education system in Pakistan is a complex and multifaceted network of institutions, with a wide range of options available for students, from primary education to higher education, with both public and private institutions offering a variety of programs and curricula.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nLiteracy Rate: 59.1%\nSchool System: 12 years of compulsory education\nLanguage of Instruction: Urdu\nAcademic Calendar: August to May\nInternational Schools: available\nTop University Ranking: ranked among the top 500 universities globally\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe education system in Pakistan is divided into three main levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary. The primary level of education, which is compulsory for all children between the ages of 5 and 10, is typically provided by government-run schools, but there are also many private schools that offer primary education. The secondary level of education, which is also compulsory, is typically provided by government-run schools and private schools, and is divided into two parts: matriculation and intermediate. The tertiary level of education, which includes universities and colleges, offers a wide range of programs and degrees, including bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees. The quality of education in Pakistan varies widely, with some institutions offering high-quality education, while others struggle with inadequate resources and poor infrastructure. Public schools, which are free and open to all, often struggle with overcrowding and limited resources, while private schools, which are fee-based, often offer better facilities and more qualified teachers.\n\nThe education system in Pakistan is also divided into two main streams: the Urdu medium stream and the English medium stream. The Urdu medium stream is the dominant stream, and is used in most government-run schools, while the English medium stream is used in many private schools and is considered to be of higher quality. The use of English as a medium of instruction is seen as a key factor in determining the quality of education, with English medium schools generally considered to be of higher quality than Urdu medium schools.\n\nIn recent years, the government of Pakistan has implemented a number of reforms aimed at improving the quality of education, including the introduction of new curricula and the provision of training for teachers. Despite these efforts, however, the education system in Pakistan still faces many challenges, including a shortage of qualified teachers, inadequate infrastructure, and a lack of resources.\n\n[SECTION] Top Universities [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| University | Location | Known For | Est.
