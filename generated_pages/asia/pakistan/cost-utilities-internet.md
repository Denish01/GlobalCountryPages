[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Pakistan's utility infrastructure has undergone significant improvements in recent years, with a focus on increasing access to electricity, water, and gas. However, the costs of these utilities can fluctuate due to various factors such as seasonal variation, inflation, and government policies. For example, electricity costs tend to be higher during the summer months due to increased demand for air conditioning. Additionally, the inflation rate of 12.6% in 2024 may impact the prices of utilities, making it essential for consumers to budget accordingly.

The quality of utility infrastructure in Pakistan varies across different regions, with urban areas generally having better access to amenities like electricity, water, and gas. However, rural areas often face challenges in accessing these basic necessities. The government has launched initiatives to improve the utility infrastructure, including the introduction of smart meters and the expansion of the national grid. Despite these efforts, utility costs can still be a significant burden for many households, especially those with limited incomes. With a GDP per capita PPP of $6,252, many Pakistanis have to allocate a substantial portion of their budget to utility bills.
