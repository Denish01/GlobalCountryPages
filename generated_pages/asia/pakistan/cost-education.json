  "content": "The cost of education in Pakistan varies significantly depending on the type of institution, with public schools being generally more affordable than private schools, and international schools being the most expensive.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nEducation Spend (% GDP): 1.9%\nLiteracy Rate: 62%\nSchool System: 12 years of compulsory education\nAcademic Year: 9 months\nCurrency: PKR\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe education system in Pakistan is divided into public and private sectors, with a significant difference in quality between the two. Public schools are generally underfunded and understaffed, resulting in a lower quality of education, while private schools are often better equipped and staffed, but also more expensive. The language of instruction in most schools is **Urdu**, although **English** is also widely used, especially in private schools. Compulsory education in Pakistan lasts for 12 years, from age 5 to 17, and is divided into primary, middle, and secondary levels. International schools are also available, especially in larger cities like **Islamabad** and **Karachi**, offering a range of curricula, including the **International Baccalaureate** and **British GCSE**.\n\nThe quality of education in Pakistan is a major concern, with many public schools struggling to provide even basic facilities, such as clean water and sanitation. In contrast, private schools and international schools often have better facilities and more qualified teachers, but are also much more expensive. This has resulted in a significant gap in educational outcomes between the rich and the poor, with many students from disadvantaged backgrounds struggling to access quality education. Despite these challenges, there are many excellent schools in Pakistan, both public and private, that offer high-quality education and a range of extracurricular activities.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 (free) | Limited resources and facilities |\n| Private Primary | $100-$500 | Range of quality and facilities, from basic to excellent |\n| Public Secondary | $0 (free) | Limited resources and facilities |\n| Private Secondary | $200-$1,000 | Range of quality and facilities, from basic to excellent |\n| International School | $2,000-$10,000 | High-quality facilities and teachers, range of curricula |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $100-$500 | $500-$1,000 | Limited resources and facilities |\n| Private University | $500-$2,000 | $1,000-$5,000 | Range of quality and facilities, from basic to excellent |\n| Top-Ranked University | $1,000-$5,000 | $2,000-$10,000 | **National University of Sciences and Technology** |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $20-$100 | Limited availability and range of quality |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $5-$20 | Range of quality and subjects, from basic to advanced |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $20-$100 | Range of languages and levels, from basic to advanced |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $10-$50 | Basic supplies, such as textbooks and stationery |\n| School Uniform | $10-$50 | Required for most schools, range of quality and price |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The best schools for expats in Pakistan are often international schools, which offer a range of curricula and high-quality facilities.\n- Scholarships are available for students from disadvantaged backgrounds, but are often limited and competitive.\n- Online learning options are becoming increasingly popular in Pakistan, with many universities and schools offering online courses and degree programs.\n- The quality of education in Pakistan is generally lower than in other countries in the region, such as **India** and **China**.\n- **English language proficiency** is highly valued in Pakistan, and many students seek to improve their English skills through private tutoring or language courses.\n- [CALLOUT] It is essential to research and visit schools before making a decision, as the quality of education can vary significantly between institutions.",
