[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Pakistan's healthcare system is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, resulting in a lack of quality and availability of services, particularly in rural areas. In contrast, private healthcare providers offer high-quality services, but at a cost that is often out of reach for the average Pakistani citizen. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only option, while foreigners and those who can afford it tend to opt for private healthcare services. It is recommended that foreigners and expats have health insurance to cover the costs of private healthcare services.

The healthcare system in Pakistan is also often plagued by issues such as corruption, lack of transparency, and inadequate regulation, which can make it difficult for patients to access quality care. Additionally, there is a significant shortage of qualified healthcare professionals, particularly in rural areas, which can exacerbate the existing healthcare challenges. Despite these challenges, there are some excellent private hospitals and medical facilities in major cities such as Karachi, Lahore, and Islamabad, which offer high-quality care and facilities.
