[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in Pakistan has been expanding rapidly over the past few years, with the number of internet users increasing significantly. However, the internet quality and speed can vary greatly depending on the location, with urban areas generally having better connectivity and faster speeds than rural areas. The average internet speed in Pakistan is around 7.4 Mbps, which is relatively slow compared to other countries in the region. Despite this, the internet is generally reliable, with most providers offering a stable connection, although outages can occur, especially during periods of heavy usage or maintenance.

The urban-rural divide is a significant issue in Pakistan, with many rural areas lacking access to reliable and fast internet. This can make it difficult for people in these areas to access online services, communicate with others, and access information. However, the government and private sector are working to improve internet connectivity in rural areas, with initiatives such as the **National Broadband Policy** aiming to increase internet penetration and improve speeds. Additionally, many mobile operators are expanding their networks to cover more rural areas, which is helping to bridge the gap in internet access.

[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]
Getting a SIM card in Pakistan is relatively easy, with many providers offering tourist-friendly plans. The main carriers, including **Jazz**, **Zong**, and **Telenor**, offer a range of plans, including prepaid and postpaid options. To get a SIM card, you will typically need to provide your passport and a photocopy of your visa, as well as fill out a registration form. You can buy SIM cards at most mobile operator stores, as well as at many retail outlets and markets. It's recommended to buy a SIM card from a official store or authorized retailer to ensure that you get a genuine SIM card and to avoid any potential scams.

The cost of a SIM card can vary depending on the provider and the plan you choose, but you can expect to pay around 5-10 USD for a tourist SIM. Data plans are also relatively affordable, with many providers offering packages that include a set amount of data, as well as voice and SMS minutes. It's a good idea to check the coverage and speeds of different providers before choosing a SIM card, as well as to read reviews and ask for recommendations from other travelers.
