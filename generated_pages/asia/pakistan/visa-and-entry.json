[/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nPakistan has a moderate visa policy, with a mix of visa-free access, visa on arrival, and required visas for different nationalities. Currently, citizens of around 50 countries can enter Pakistan visa-free or obtain a visa on arrival, while others need to apply for a visa in advance. The country has been working to relax its visa rules to promote tourism and trade, especially with neighboring countries and strategic partners.\n\nThe government of Pakistan has introduced an electronic visa system, which allows citizens of eligible countries to apply for a visa online. This has streamlined the process and made it easier for tourists and business travelers to visit the country. However, the requirements and regulations can still be complex, and it's essential to check with the official authorities for the latest information.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | Yes | Tourist/Business | 30 days | Can apply for eVisa |\n| UK Citizens | Yes | Tourist/Business | 30 days | Can apply for eVisa |\n| EU Citizens | Yes | Tourist/Business | 30 days | Can apply for eVisa, some countries eligible for visa on arrival |\n| Canadian Citizens | Yes | Tourist/Business | 30 days | Can apply for eVisa |\n| Australian Citizens | Yes | Tourist/Business | 30 days | Can apply for eVisa |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | Tourist/Business | 30 days | Special permit required for some areas |\n| Chinese Citizens | No | Visa-free | 30 days | For business and tourism purposes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** To visit Pakistan as a tourist, you'll typically need a **tourist visa**, which can be obtained online through the eVisa system or on arrival at certain airports.
