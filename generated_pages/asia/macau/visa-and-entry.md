# Macau Visa & Entry Requirements

You will likely need a visa to enter Macau, depending on your nationality, but some countries enjoy visa-free access or can obtain a visa on arrival.

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Macau before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Macau has a moderate visa policy, allowing citizens of around 70 countries to enter visa-free for a certain period, while others can obtain a visa on arrival or need to apply for a visa in advance. The visa policy is designed to balance the needs of tourism, business, and immigration, while ensuring the security and integrity of the territory. Macau's visa-free access policy is generally more liberal than that of mainland China, but more restrictive than that of Hong Kong.

Macau's visa policy is also influenced by its relationship with mainland China and Hong Kong, with which it has a high degree of economic and social integration. As a result, citizens of these territories enjoy more favorable visa terms, including longer periods of stay and easier access to residence permits. Overall, Macau's visa policy is designed to facilitate travel and trade, while maintaining the necessary controls to ensure the territory's security and prosperity.
