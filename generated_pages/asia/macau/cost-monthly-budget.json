However, the cost of living can vary greatly depending on the individual's lifestyle and budget. A budget of $2,500 per month can provide a relatively comfortable life, especially for those who are willing to share an apartment and cook most of their meals. On the other hand, a mid-range budget of $4,000 per month can offer a more relaxed lifestyle, with the ability to afford a one-bedroom apartment in the city center and dine out occasionally. A comfortable budget of $6,000 per month can provide a luxurious lifestyle, with the ability to afford a nice two-bedroom apartment and eat out frequently.\n\nIn comparison to neighboring countries, Macau is more expensive than mainland China, but slightly less expensive than Hong Kong. The cost of living in Macau is also influenced by its proximity to China and the large number of tourists that visit the territory, which can drive up prices for accommodation and food.
