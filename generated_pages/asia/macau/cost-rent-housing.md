[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Macau's housing market is highly competitive, with a limited supply of apartments and a high demand from locals and expats alike. The rental market is dominated by short-term leases, typically ranging from 6 to 12 months, with a standard deposit requirement of 2-3 months' rent. Tenants have limited rights, and it is essential to carefully review the lease agreement before signing. Compared to its regional neighbors, Macau's housing costs are higher than in mainland China but lower than in Hong Kong. The **inflation rate** of 0.5% in 2023 has helped keep housing prices relatively stable, but the **GDP per capita** of $126,960 indicates a high level of affluence, which contributes to the demand for luxury housing.

The Macau government has implemented measures to control the housing market, including restrictions on property purchases by non-residents and incentives for developers to build more affordable housing. However, these efforts have had limited success, and the housing market remains highly competitive. Expats and locals alike often find themselves competing for a limited number of apartments, driving up prices and making it challenging to find affordable housing. The **education spend** of 3.5% of GDP in 2023 is a significant investment in the city's future, but it also puts pressure on the housing market as more families move to the area for better educational opportunities.
