[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Macau has a subtropical climate, with four distinct seasons. The **dry season** typically runs from October to March, with mild temperatures and low humidity, making it the best time to visit. The **wet season**, from April to September, is characterized by hot and humid weather, with occasional typhoons. The summer months can be quite hot, with temperatures often reaching over 30°C, while the winter months are mild, with temperatures ranging from 10°C to 20°C. The seasonal changes can significantly affect travel, as the dry season is ideal for outdoor activities like walking and sightseeing, while the wet season is better suited for indoor activities like visiting museums and casinos.

The climate in Macau is also influenced by its location on the coast, with the sea temperature playing a significant role in regulating the temperature. The **monsoon season**, which typically runs from May to September, can bring heavy rainfall and strong winds, making it a less desirable time to visit. However, the monsoon season also brings a lush green landscape, making it a great time for nature lovers and photographers.

In terms of travel, the seasons can impact the crowds and prices, with the peak season being the most crowded and expensive. The budget season, on the other hand, offers lower prices and smaller crowds, making it a great time for budget-conscious travelers. However, the budget season also coincides with the wet season, which can make outdoor activities more challenging.
