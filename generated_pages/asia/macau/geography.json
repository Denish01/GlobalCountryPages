The region is bordered by the South China Sea to the south and west, and by China's Guangdong Province to the north and east. Macau's strategic location has made it an important trading center and cultural hub for centuries, with its ports and waterways connecting it to the rest of Asia and the world.\n\nThe borders of Macau are defined by its coastline, which stretches for 41 kilometers, and by its land border with China, which is approximately 8.7 kilometers long. The region's proximity to Hong Kong and China has facilitated the exchange of people, goods, and ideas, and has contributed to its unique cultural identity. Macau is also connected to the Chinese mainland by several bridges and tunnels, including the Lotus Bridge, which links the region to the city of Zhuhai in Guangdong Province.\n\n[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]\nMacau's terrain is generally flat, with some hills and mountains on the islands of Taipa and Coloane.
