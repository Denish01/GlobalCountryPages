Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Macau before traveling. [/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nMacau has a moderate visa policy, allowing citizens of around 70 countries to enter visa-free for a certain period, while others can obtain a visa on arrival or need to apply for a visa in advance. The visa policy is designed to balance the needs of tourism, business, and immigration, while ensuring the security and integrity of the territory. Macau's visa-free access policy is generally more liberal than that of mainland China, but more restrictive than that of Hong Kong.\n\nMacau's visa policy is also influenced by its relationship with mainland China and Hong Kong, with which it has a high degree of economic and social integration. As a result, citizens of these territories enjoy more favorable visa terms, including longer periods of stay and easier access to residence permits. Overall, Macau's visa policy is designed to facilitate travel and trade, while maintaining the necessary controls to ensure the territory's security and prosperity.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Can enter multiple times |\n| UK Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Can enter multiple times |\n| EU Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Can enter multiple times, except for Ireland and Portugal which have 30 days |\n| Canadian Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Can enter multiple times |\n| Australian Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Can enter multiple times |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | Visa on Arrival | 30 days | Must meet certain requirements, including having a return ticket |\n| Chinese Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | For residents of mainland China, must use the Mainland Travel Permit for Hong Kong and Macau |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can enter Macau visa-free for up to 90 days, depending on their nationality.
