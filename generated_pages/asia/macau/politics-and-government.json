The **Basic Law**, Macau's constitutional document, outlines the framework for the region's political system, ensuring a high degree of autonomy in all matters except foreign affairs and defense. The **Chief Executive**, elected by a 400-member **Election Committee**, serves as both the head of state and head of government, and is responsible for appointing the **Executive Council**, a group of senior officials who advise on major policy decisions. The **Legislative Assembly**, composed of 33 members, is responsible for enacting laws and exercising oversight over the government.\n\nThe separation of powers in Macau is not as clear-cut as in some other jurisdictions, with the Chief Executive playing a dominant role in the government. However, the Legislative Assembly has the power to impeach the Chief Executive and other senior officials, providing a check on the executive branch. The judicial system is independent, with the **Court of Final Appeal** serving as the highest court in the region. Macau's political system is unitary, with the central government exercising control over all aspects of governance.\n\nThe **Executive Council**, composed of senior officials appointed by the Chief Executive, plays a key role in advising on major policy decisions. The Council is responsible for proposing legislation to the Legislative Assembly and for overseeing the implementation of government policies. The **Commission Against Corruption**, an independent agency, is responsible for investigating and preventing corruption in the government.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | Office of the Chief Executive | Ho Iat Seng | Head of state and government |\n| Executive | Executive Council | Ho Iat Seng | Advisory body to the Chief Executive |\n| Legislative | Legislative Assembly | Kou Hoi In | Lawmaking and oversight |\n| Judicial | Court of Final Appeal | Sam Hou Fai | Highest court in Macau |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Major Political Parties [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Party | Position | Leader | Seats | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Union for Development | Centrist | Ho Iat Seng | 12 | Pro-establishment party |\n| Macau Business Interest Union | Centrist | Chan Meng Kam | 7 | Represents business interests |\n| Macau United Citizens Association | Centrist | Lo Wai Kwok | 5 | Pro-establishment party |\n| New Hope | Liberal | José Maria Pereira Coutinho | 2 | Advocates for social and economic reform |\n| Alliance for the Development of Macau | Liberal | Vong Hin Fai | 1 | Advocates for democratic reform |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Elections [/SECTION]\n- The **Chief Executive** is elected by a 400-member **Election Committee**, which is composed of representatives from various sectors of society.\n- The **Legislative Assembly** is elected by a combination of direct and indirect elections, with 14 members elected directly by the people, 12 elected indirectly by special interest groups, and 7 appointed by the Chief Executive.\n- The last **Legislative Assembly election** was held in 2017, with a voter turnout of 57.3%.\n- The next **Legislative Assembly election** is scheduled to be held in 2021.\n\n[SECTION] Political Stability & Challenges [/SECTION]\n- Macau has a high degree of **political stability**, with a strong economy and a stable government.\n- However, the region faces challenges related to **corruption**, with concerns about the influence of money politics and the lack of transparency in government decision-making.\n- The **gaming industry**, which is a major driver of Macau's economy, is subject to **regulatory risks**, with the government seeking to diversify the economy and reduce dependence on gaming.\n- Macau's **relationship with mainland China** is complex, with the region seeking to maintain its autonomy while also cooperating with the central government on economic and security issues.\n- The **democracy movement** in Macau is relatively weak, with limited opportunities for political participation and a lack of **electoral reform**.\n- The **freedom of speech** and **freedom of assembly** are generally respected in Macau, but there are concerns about the **independence of the media** and the **rule of law**.\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Relations [/SECTION]\n- Macau is a member of the **World Trade Organization** and the **International Monetary Fund**, and participates in regional organizations such as the **Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation** forum.\n- Macau has **diplomatic relations** with over 100 countries, including Portugal, China, and the United States.\n- The region is a **separate customs territory** from mainland China, with its own **tariff regime** and **trade agreements**.\n- Macau is a member of the **United Nations** and participates in various **UN agencies**, including the **UNESCO** and the **World Health Organization**.\n- The region has a **cooperation agreement** with the **European Union**, which provides for cooperation in areas such as trade, investment, and education.",
