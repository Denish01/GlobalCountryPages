The population growth rate is relatively low, at 1.4%, which is due to a combination of factors, including a low fertility rate and an aging population. The urban population accounts for 100% of the total population, with the majority residing in the Macau Peninsula and the island of Taipa. The population size has been steadily increasing over the years, with a significant influx of migrants from mainland China and other parts of the world.\n\nThe population of Macau is also characterized by a high life expectancy, with an average lifespan of 84.4 years, which is one of the highest in the world. However, the fertility rate is relatively low, with an average of 0.95 children per woman, which is below the replacement rate. This has significant implications for the future population growth and demographic trends in Macau. The government has implemented various policies to address the low fertility rate, including measures to support families and encourage childbirth.\n\nThe population of Macau is also highly urbanized, with a significant proportion of the population residing in high-rise apartments and condominiums.
