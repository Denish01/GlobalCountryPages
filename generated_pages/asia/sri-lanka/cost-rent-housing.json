Typical lease terms in Sri Lanka are for a minimum of one year, with a two-month deposit required upfront. Tenant rights are protected under the Rent Act of Sri Lanka, which regulates the relationship between landlords and tenants. Compared to its regional neighbors, Sri Lanka's housing costs are relatively lower, making it an attractive option for expats and tourists. The country's housing market is also influenced by its growing economy and tourism industry, which has led to an increase in demand for rental properties, particularly in popular areas such as Colombo and Kandy.\n\nThe housing market in Sri Lanka is also characterized by a mix of traditional and modern housing options, with many new developments and apartment complexes being built in recent years. This has led to an increase in the availability of housing options, particularly in urban areas. However, the market can be competitive, and it is not uncommon for properties to be rented quickly, especially in popular areas. As a result, it is essential for renters to be prepared and to act quickly when they find a suitable property.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $150-300 | $80-200 | basic amenities, 1-2 rooms |\n| 1 Bedroom | $200-400 | $100-300 | fully furnished, 1 bathroom |\n| 2 Bedroom | $350-600 | $200-500 | family size, 2 bathrooms |\n| 3 Bedroom | $500-1,000 | $300-800 | spacious, 3 bathrooms |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $1,500-3,000 | prime locations, modern amenities |\n| Suburbs | $800-2,000 | residential areas, tree-lined streets |\n| Rural | $200-800 | scenic views, peaceful surroundings |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- Cinnamon Gardens: a upscale neighborhood with tree-lined streets and modern amenities, rent range $300-800 USD per month\n- Kollupitiya: a popular area with a mix of old and new buildings, rent range $200-600 USD per month\n- Bambalapitiya: a lively neighborhood with a range of restaurants and shops, rent range $250-700 USD per month\n- Wellawatte: a coastal neighborhood with scenic views, rent range $200-500 USD per month\n- Nawala: a residential area with a range of housing options, rent range $150-400 USD per month\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Sri Lanka [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods thoroughly before making a decision, considering factors such as safety, proximity to amenities, and transportation options\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent to find a suitable property, and be sure to read reviews and check references\n- Be prepared to act quickly when finding a suitable property, as the rental market can be competitive\n- Negotiate the rent and terms of the lease carefully, and be sure to get everything in writing\n- Be aware of scams and ensure that you are working with a legitimate landlord or real estate agent\n- Consider renting a furnished apartment, as this can be more convenient and cost-effective, especially for short-term rentals",
