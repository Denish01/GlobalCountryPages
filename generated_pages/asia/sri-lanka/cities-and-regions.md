[SECTION] How Sri Lanka Is Divided [/SECTION]
Sri Lanka is an island nation located in South Asia, and its administrative structure is divided into nine provinces, which are further subdivided into 25 districts. Each province has its own provincial council, which is responsible for overseeing local affairs, including education, healthcare, and infrastructure development. The provinces are also divided into several divisions, known as Divisional Secretariats, which are the smallest administrative units in the country. This system of government allows for a degree of autonomy at the local level, enabling provinces to address their unique needs and challenges.

The nine provinces of Sri Lanka are diverse, with different cultures, languages, and economic profiles. The Western Province, which includes the capital city of Colombo, is the most populous and economically developed province, while the Northern Province, which was affected by the civil war, is still recovering and rebuilding.
