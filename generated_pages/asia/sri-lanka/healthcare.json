The public healthcare system is well-organized and provides a wide range of services, including primary care, specialty care, and emergency services. However, the quality of care and availability of facilities can vary significantly between urban and rural areas, with urban areas like Colombo and Kandy having better-equipped and staffed hospitals. The private sector, on the other hand, offers high-quality care, but at a higher cost, making it more accessible to those who can afford it.\n\nThe quality of care in Sri Lanka is generally good, with many hospitals and medical facilities meeting international standards. However, there can be shortages of certain medical supplies and equipment, especially in rural areas. Additionally, the healthcare system can be overcrowded, especially in public hospitals, which can lead to longer waiting times and reduced quality of care.\n\nDespite these challenges, Sri Lanka has made significant progress in improving its healthcare system in recent years, with a focus on increasing access to healthcare services, especially in rural areas. The government has also implemented various initiatives to improve the quality of care, including training programs for healthcare professionals and investments in new medical equipment and technology.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| National Hospital of Sri Lanka | Colombo | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Yes |\n| Lanka Hospitals | Colombo | Private | Cardiology, oncology, neurology | Yes |\n| Durdans Hospital | Colombo | Private | General medicine, surgery, pediatrics | Yes |\n| Asiri Hospital | Colombo | Private | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Yes |\n| Kandy Hospital | Kandy | Public | General medicine, surgery, pediatrics | Limited |\n| Apollo Hospital | Colombo | Private | Cardiology, oncology, neurology | Yes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Private health insurance** is recommended for foreigners and expats, as it provides access to better-equipped and staffed private hospitals.\n- Local insurance options are available, but may not provide the same level of coverage as international insurance plans.\n- **Expatriate health insurance** plans are available, which provide coverage for expats and their families.\n- The cost of health insurance in Sri Lanka can vary depending on the provider and the level of coverage, but on average, a private health insurance plan can cost around LKR 50,000-100,000 per year.\n- **Travel insurance** is also recommended for tourists, as it provides coverage for unexpected medical emergencies and evacuations.\n- Some insurance providers offer **medical evacuation** coverage, which can be essential in case of a serious medical emergency.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- Medications are widely available in Sri Lanka, with many pharmacies located throughout the country.\n- **Prescription requirements** vary depending on the medication, but many medications are available over-the-counter.\n- **Common brands** like Panadol and Voltaren are widely available, but some medications may be scarce or unavailable.\n- The cost of medications in Sri Lanka can be relatively low, with many medications available for LKR 100-500.\n- **Pharmacy access** is widespread, with many pharmacies open 24 hours a day, especially in urban areas.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Hepatitis A** and **typhoid** vaccinations are recommended for all travelers to Sri Lanka.\n- **Rabies** vaccination is also recommended, as rabies is common in Sri Lanka.\n- **Malaria** and **dengue fever** are present in some parts of the country, especially in rural areas.\n- **Water safety** is a concern, with many water sources contaminated with bacteria and other pathogens.\n- **Food safety** is also a concern, with many food vendors and restaurants not following proper food handling and preparation procedures.\n- **Chikungunya** and **zika** viruses are also present in Sri Lanka, and travelers should take precautions to prevent mosquito bites.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- Sri Lanka is a popular destination for **medical tourism**, with many private hospitals offering high-quality care at lower costs than in many Western countries.\n- **Popular procedures** include cosmetic surgery, dental care, and orthopedic surgery.\n- **Accredited hospitals** like Lanka Hospitals and Apollo Hospital offer high-quality care and are popular with medical tourists.\n- The cost savings can be significant, with many procedures costing 50-70% less than in Western countries.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- In case of a medical emergency, call **1990** for an ambulance.\n- **Ambulance reliability** can vary depending on the location, but many private hospitals offer reliable ambulance services.\n- The **nearest hospital** should be contacted in case of an emergency, and many hospitals have 24-hour emergency services.\n- **Insurance claims** should be submitted as soon as possible, and many insurance providers have 24-hour claims services.\n- **Medical evacuation** may be necessary in case of a serious medical emergency, and some insurance providers offer medical evacuation coverage.",
