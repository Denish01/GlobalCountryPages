[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Sri Lanka's population size is relatively small compared to other countries in Asia, but its growth trends and urbanization patterns are notable. The country has experienced a decline in population growth rate over the past few decades, with a current rate of 0.5% per annum. This decline is attributed to a decrease in fertility rates, which have fallen from 3.5 children per woman in 1990 to 2.1 children per woman in 2020. The urban population accounts for approximately 18% of the total population, with the majority of people residing in rural areas. Migration patterns in Sri Lanka are primarily driven by economic factors, with many people moving from rural areas to urban centers in search of better job opportunities.

The population of Sri Lanka is expected to continue growing, albeit at a slow rate, with projections indicating that the population will reach 25 million by 2030. The country's population is also undergoing significant changes in terms of age structure, with a increasing proportion of older people and a declining proportion of young people. This demographic shift is likely to have significant implications for the country's economy, healthcare system, and social security programs.

Sri Lanka's population is also characterized by a significant diaspora community, with many Sri Lankans living and working abroad. The country's diaspora community is estimated to be around 1.5 million people, with the majority residing in countries such as the United States, Canada, and Australia. The diaspora community plays an important role in the country's economy, with remittances from abroad accounting for a significant proportion of the country's foreign exchange earnings.
