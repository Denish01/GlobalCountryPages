[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Sri Lanka's healthcare system is a mixed model, comprising both public and private providers. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of good quality and is accessible to all citizens, with most services provided free of charge or at a nominal fee. However, the public system often suffers from long waiting times and a shortage of specialized medical staff. In contrast, the private healthcare system in Sri Lanka is well-developed and offers high-quality medical care, but at a significantly higher cost. For foreigners, it is recommended to opt for private healthcare services, as they often provide better facilities and English-speaking staff. While health insurance is not mandatory in Sri Lanka, it is highly recommended, especially for foreigners, to cover unexpected medical expenses.

The healthcare system in Sri Lanka works differently for locals and foreigners. Locals can access public healthcare services, which are generally affordable, while foreigners are often required to pay out-of-pocket for medical services. Many private hospitals and clinics in Sri Lanka cater specifically to foreigners and offer a range of medical services, including specialized treatments and emergency care. It is essential for foreigners to have a valid health insurance policy that covers them in Sri Lanka, as medical expenses can be high, especially in private hospitals.
