[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Sri Lanka has a tropical climate with two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from December to April, is characterized by warm and sunny weather, with average temperatures ranging from 22 to 30 degrees Celsius. The wet season, which runs from May to August, is marked by heavy rainfall and strong winds, making it challenging to travel and engage in outdoor activities. The country's climate is also influenced by its geography, with the central highlands experiencing a cooler climate than the coastal regions. The dry season is the best time to visit Sri Lanka, as it offers ideal conditions for exploring the country's cultural and natural attractions.

The dry season is further divided into two sub-seasons: the northeast monsoon season, which runs from December to February, and the inter-monsoon season, which runs from March to April. The northeast monsoon season is characterized by gentle breezes and calm seas, making it ideal for beach activities and water sports. The inter-monsoon season is marked by increasing temperatures and humidity, but it is still a good time to visit Sri Lanka, as the weather is generally warm and sunny.

The wet season, which runs from May to August, is characterized by heavy rainfall and strong winds, making it challenging to travel and engage in outdoor activities. The southwest monsoon season, which runs from May to July, is the wettest period, with most of the country experiencing heavy rainfall and flooding. The southeast monsoon season, which runs from August to September, is marked by decreasing rainfall, but the weather is still unpredictable and can be challenging for travelers.
