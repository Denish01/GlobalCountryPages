  "content": "The cost of utilities and internet in Sri Lanka can vary depending on the location, usage, and service provider, but on average, a monthly utility bill for an 85 sqm apartment can range from $50 to $150 USD.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Utilities (85 sqm apt): ($100 USD)\nInternet (60 Mbps): ($25 USD/month)\nMobile Data (10GB): ($5 USD/month)\nElectricity Cost: ($0.15 per kWh)\nCurrency: LKR\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nSri Lanka's utility infrastructure is generally well-developed, with a high percentage of households having access to electricity, water, and sanitation. However, the costs of utilities can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher demand for electricity during the summer months and higher water usage during the dry season. The government has implemented measures to stabilize prices, but the overall cost of utilities can still vary depending on the location and usage. The current inflation rate of -0.4% in 2024 is relatively low, which can help keep utility costs stable.\n\nThe quality of utility infrastructure in Sri Lanka is generally good, with a reliable supply of electricity and water. However, there may be occasional power outages and water shortages, especially during peak demand periods. The government is investing in renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, to reduce the country's dependence on fossil fuels and mitigate the impact of climate change on the utility sector. With a GDP per capita PPP of $15,633 in 2024, Sri Lankans have a relatively high standard of living, which can support the demand for modern utilities and services.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $30 | $50 | $70 | |\n| Water | $10 | $15 | $20 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $5 | $10 | $15 | |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $5 | $10 | $15 | (included in municipal tax) |\n| **Total** | **$50** | **$85** | **$120** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $15-25 | 10-30 Mbps | Dialog, SLT |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $30-50 | 60-100 Mbps | Dialog, SLT |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $3-5 | 1-5 GB | Dialog, Etisalat |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $10-20 | 5-10 GB | Dialog, Etisalat |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $30-50 | varies | Dialog, SLT |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $8 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (e.g. IFlix) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities, it is recommended to contact the service providers directly, such as the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) for electricity and the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) for water.\n- Prepaid electricity meters are available, which can help households budget their energy usage and avoid unexpected bills.\n- Dialog and SLT are two of the major internet service providers in Sri Lanka, offering a range of plans and packages to suit different needs and budgets.\n- To save on utility bills, households can take measures such as using energy-efficient appliances, reducing water usage, and insulating their homes to reduce heat gain and loss.\n- It is also recommended to regularly review and compare utility plans and prices to ensure that households are getting the best value for their money.",
