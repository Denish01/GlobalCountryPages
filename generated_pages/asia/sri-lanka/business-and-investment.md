[SECTION] Business Environment [/SECTION]
Sri Lanka has a mixed business environment, with a government that is generally supportive of foreign investment, but also a complex bureaucracy that can hinder business operations. The country has made significant progress in recent years in improving its business climate, with a range of reforms aimed at simplifying procedures and reducing corruption. However, more needs to be done to address the remaining challenges, including a lack of transparency and accountability in government decision-making. The country's strategic location, with access to major shipping lanes, and its highly literate and skilled workforce, make it an attractive location for foreign investors.

The government has established a range of institutions to support business, including the Board of Investment, which provides a range of incentives and services to investors. However, the country's bureaucracy can be slow and cumbersome, and corruption remains a significant problem. The government has taken steps to address these issues, including the introduction of a new anti-corruption law and the establishment of a specialized anti-corruption agency.

Sri Lanka's business environment is also influenced by its cultural and social context. The country has a highly developed social safety net, with a range of programs aimed at reducing poverty and improving living standards. However, the country also faces significant social and economic challenges, including a large informal sector and a shortage of skilled workers.
