[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The Sri Lankan property market has been growing steadily over the past few years, driven by a combination of factors including government initiatives to promote tourism and foreign investment. The market is characterized by a mix of modern high-rise apartments and colonial-era homes, with prices varying widely depending on location, size, and condition. In general, prices in urban areas such as Colombo and Kandy tend to be higher than in rural areas, where land and property are more readily available. The current market trend is towards luxury apartments and mixed-use developments, particularly in the capital city of Colombo.

The price trajectory of the Sri Lankan property market has been upward, with prices increasing by around 5-10% per annum over the past few years. However, the market is not without its challenges, including a shortage of affordable housing and a lack of transparency in property transactions. The government has implemented various measures to address these issues, including the introduction of new regulations to govern the property sector and the establishment of a **land registry** to improve transparency.

In terms of urban vs rural areas, the majority of Sri Lanka's population lives in rural areas, where agriculture is the main source of income. However, the urban areas are growing rapidly, driven by the expansion of the service sector and the growth of tourism. As a result, there is a high demand for housing in urban areas, particularly in Colombo, which is the commercial and financial hub of the country.
