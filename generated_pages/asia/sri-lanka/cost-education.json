The language of instruction in public schools is typically **Sinhala** or **Tamil**, while private schools often use **English** as the primary language. Compulsory education in Sri Lanka lasts for 13 years, from age 5 to 18, and is divided into primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. International schools are also available in Sri Lanka, particularly in the capital city of Colombo, offering a range of curricula including **International Baccalaureate**, **Cambridge**, and **Edexcel**.\n\nThe quality of education in Sri Lanka's public sector can vary depending on the location and resources available, with schools in urban areas tend to have better facilities and more qualified teachers. Private schools, on the other hand, often have smaller class sizes and more modern facilities, but can be expensive and out of reach for many Sri Lankan families. International schools in Sri Lanka offer a high-quality education and are popular among expat families, but can be very expensive, with annual fees ranging from $5,000 to $20,000 or more.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 (free) | Quality can vary depending on location |\n| Private Primary | $500-$2,000 | Range depends on tier and location |\n| Public Secondary | $0 (free) | Quality can vary depending on location |\n| Private Secondary | $1,000-$5,000 | Range depends on tier and location |\n| International School | $5,000-$20,000 | Curriculum types include IB, Cambridge, and Edexcel |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $100-$500 | $1,000-$2,000 | Limited seats available for international students |\n| Private University | $2,000-$5,000 | $3,000-$6,000 | Range depends on institution and program |\n| Top-Ranked University | $3,000-$6,000 | $5,000-$10,000 | University of Colombo and University of Peradeniya are top-ranked |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $50-$200 | Depends on location and quality |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $10-$50 | Popular for exam preparation and language learning |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $100-$500 | Range depends on institution and level |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $50-$100 | Basic supplies include textbooks, notebooks, and stationery |\n| School Uniform | $20-$50 | Required for most schools, including public and private |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The quality of education in Sri Lanka is generally considered to be good, with a strong emphasis on **mathematics** and **science**.\n- Expats often prefer international schools, which offer a range of curricula and a more **Western-style education**.\n- Scholarships are available for Sri Lankan students, particularly for those from low-income backgrounds, and can cover up to 100% of tuition fees.\n- Online learning options are becoming increasingly popular in Sri Lanka, particularly for **English language learning** and **professional development**.\n- Education in Sri Lanka is generally considered to be of high quality compared to other countries in the region, with a strong emphasis on **academic achievement** and **discipline**.\n- [CALLOUT] It's worth noting that the education system in Sri Lanka can be highly competitive, with a strong emphasis on **exams** and **grades**, which can be challenging for some students.",
