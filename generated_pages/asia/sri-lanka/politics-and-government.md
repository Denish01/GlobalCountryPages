[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Sri Lanka is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **executive branch** is headed by the President, who is both the head of state and head of government. The President is directly elected by the people for a term of five years and has significant powers, including the ability to appoint the Prime Minister, ministers, and other high-ranking officials. The **legislative branch** is composed of a unicameral Parliament, which has 225 seats and is elected by proportional representation for a term of five years. The **judicial branch** is independent and composed of the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal, and subordinate courts.

The system of government in Sri Lanka is designed to provide a balance of power between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The **separation of powers** is intended to prevent any one branch from becoming too powerful, and to ensure that each branch has checks and balances on the others. For example, the President has the power to appoint judges, but the Parliament has the power to impeach them. The Parliament also has the power to pass laws, but the President has the power to veto them.

The government of Sri Lanka is also characterized by a **unitary system**, where the central government has significant powers and the provinces have limited autonomy. This has been a subject of controversy, particularly among the minority Tamil population, who have called for greater autonomy and recognition of their rights.
