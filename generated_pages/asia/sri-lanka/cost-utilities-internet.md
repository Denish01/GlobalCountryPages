[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Sri Lanka's utility infrastructure is generally well-developed, with a high percentage of households having access to electricity, water, and sanitation. However, the costs of utilities can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher demand for electricity during the summer months and higher water usage during the dry season. The government has implemented measures to stabilize prices, but the overall cost of utilities can still vary depending on the location and usage. The current inflation rate of -0.4% in 2024 is relatively low, which can help keep utility costs stable.

The quality of utility infrastructure in Sri Lanka is generally good, with a reliable supply of electricity and water. However, there may be occasional power outages and water shortages, especially during peak demand periods. The government is investing in renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, to reduce the country's dependence on fossil fuels and mitigate the impact of climate change on the utility sector. With a GDP per capita PPP of $15,633 in 2024, Sri Lankans have a relatively high standard of living, which can support the demand for modern utilities and services.
