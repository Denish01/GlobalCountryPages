Primary education, which is compulsory for all children between the ages of 5 and 11, is provided free of charge by the government. Secondary education, which spans from ages 11 to 18, is also compulsory and provides students with a broad range of subjects, including **mathematics**, **science**, and **languages**. Tertiary education, which includes universities and vocational training institutions, provides students with specialized training and degree programs. The quality of education in Sri Lanka is generally considered to be high, with a strong emphasis on **academic achievement** and **discipline**. However, there is a significant divide between public and private education, with private schools and universities generally offering better facilities and resources.\n\nThe public education system in Sri Lanka is free and accessible to all citizens, but it is often overcrowded and underfunded. In contrast, private schools and universities offer better facilities and resources, but are often expensive and exclusive. Despite these challenges, Sri Lanka has made significant progress in improving its education system, with a strong emphasis on **teacher training** and **curriculum development**. The government has also implemented various initiatives to improve access to education, particularly in rural and disadvantaged areas.\n\nThe education system in Sri Lanka is also known for its **competitive entrance exams**, which are used to determine admission to universities and other tertiary institutions. These exams are highly competitive, and students often spend many hours preparing for them. Despite the challenges, the education system in Sri Lanka has produced many highly skilled and educated individuals, who have gone on to make significant contributions in fields such as **medicine**, **engineering**, and **law**.\n\n[SECTION] Top Universities [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| University | Location | Known For | Est.
