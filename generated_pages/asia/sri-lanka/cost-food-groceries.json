The country's food prices are generally lower compared to other countries in the region, making it an attractive destination for foodies and budget travelers. The cost of food in Sri Lanka is driven by factors such as the availability of local ingredients, transportation costs, and government taxes. Eating out is a popular culture in Sri Lanka, with many restaurants, cafes, and street food stalls offering a wide range of dishes at affordable prices. However, home cooking is also a significant part of Sri Lankan culture, with many locals preferring to prepare traditional meals at home using fresh ingredients from local markets.\n\nThe inflation rate in Sri Lanka has been relatively low in recent years, with a rate of -0.4% in 2024, which has helped to keep food prices stable. However, the country's economy has been affected by global events, and food prices can fluctuate depending on the availability of imported goods. Despite this, Sri Lanka remains a great value destination for food, with many affordable options available for travelers and locals alike. The country's GDP per capita PPP is $15,633, which is relatively high compared to other countries in the region, indicating a strong economy and a high standard of living.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $0.80 | 150 LKR | |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $0.50 | 100 LKR | |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $1.20 | 220 LKR | |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $0.60 | 110 LKR | |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $3.50 | 640 LKR | |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $6.00 | 1100 LKR | |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $2.00 | 360 LKR | |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $0.80 | 150 LKR | |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $0.60 | 110 LKR | |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $0.40 | 70 LKR | |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $4.00 | 720 LKR | |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $0.30 | 55 LKR | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $1-3 | (typical dishes like hoppers, string hoppers, and Pittu) |\n| Casual Restaurant | $5-10 | (one person, with rice and curry) |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $15-30 | (3 courses, with meat or seafood) |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $30-50 | (upscale, with wine and dessert) |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $2-3 | |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $4-6 | |\n| Cappuccino | $2-3 | |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $1-2 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nThe prices of groceries in Sri Lanka can vary significantly depending on whether you shop at a supermarket or a local market. Supermarkets tend to be more expensive, with prices ranging from 10-20% higher than local markets. However, supermarkets offer a wider range of products, including imported goods, and a more convenient shopping experience. Local markets, on the other hand, offer fresh produce, meats, and spices at lower prices, but the quality and variety of products can be inconsistent. It's recommended to buy fresh produce, meats, and spices at local markets, while opting for supermarkets for packaged goods and imported products.\n\nWhen shopping at local markets, it's essential to bargain and negotiate prices, especially for fresh produce and meats. Vendors often quote higher prices for tourists, so it's crucial to have a local guide or friend to help you navigate the markets. Additionally, local markets often have a wider range of traditional and exotic ingredients, such as **gotu kola**, **kurakkan**, and **pandan leaves**, which can add unique flavors and textures to your meals. Supermarkets, on the other hand, offer a more convenient and air-conditioned shopping experience, with a wider range of packaged goods and imported products.\n\n[SECTION] Local Food Tips [/SECTION]\n- Eat at local eateries and street food stalls, which offer affordable and delicious meals starting from $1-3 USD per person.\n- Try traditional Sri Lankan dishes like **hoppers**, **string hoppers**, and **Pittu**, which are made from local ingredients and are often priced lower than Western-style meals.\n- Buy fresh produce, meats, and spices at local markets, where you can find a wide range of ingredients at lower prices.\n- Avoid buying imported goods, which can be expensive and may not be as fresh as local products.\n- Try local fruits like **mangoes**, **bananas**, and **pineapples**, which are abundant and affordable in Sri Lanka.\n- Drink **king coconut water**, which is a refreshing and healthy beverage that's widely available in Sri Lanka.",
