  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Sri Lanka varies significantly between public and private providers, with out-of-pocket expenses accounting for approximately 54.8% of total healthcare expenditure per capita, which stands at $134.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $134\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 54.8%\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 110\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: LKR\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nSri Lanka's healthcare system is a mixed model, comprising both public and private providers. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of good quality and is accessible to all citizens, with most services provided free of charge or at a nominal fee. However, the public system often suffers from long waiting times and a shortage of specialized medical staff. In contrast, the private healthcare system in Sri Lanka is well-developed and offers high-quality medical care, but at a significantly higher cost. For foreigners, it is recommended to opt for private healthcare services, as they often provide better facilities and English-speaking staff. While health insurance is not mandatory in Sri Lanka, it is highly recommended, especially for foreigners, to cover unexpected medical expenses.\n\nThe healthcare system in Sri Lanka works differently for locals and foreigners. Locals can access public healthcare services, which are generally affordable, while foreigners are often required to pay out-of-pocket for medical services. Many private hospitals and clinics in Sri Lanka cater specifically to foreigners and offer a range of medical services, including specialized treatments and emergency care. It is essential for foreigners to have a valid health insurance policy that covers them in Sri Lanka, as medical expenses can be high, especially in private hospitals.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $5-$10 | $20-$50 | |\n| Specialist Consultation | $10-$20 | $50-$100 | |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-$20 | $30-$70 | |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$20 | $30-$70 | |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $20-$50 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$100 | |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $50-$200 | |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$2,000 | |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,000-$3,000 | |\n| MRI Scan | $100-$300 | |\n| X-Ray | $20-$50 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Covers basic medical services, including doctor visits and hospital stays |\n| Comprehensive Private | $50-$100 | Covers a wide range of medical services, including specialized treatments and emergency care |\n| International / Expat | $100-$200 | Covers medical expenses worldwide, including evacuation and repatriation services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medication can be purchased at a relatively low cost, with prices starting from $5-$10 per medication\n- Over-the-counter medication is widely available at pharmacies and supermarkets\n- Many pharmacies in Sri Lanka are open 24 hours, especially in major cities\n- Prescription rules are generally strict, and medication can only be purchased with a valid prescription\n- Common medication prices include $10-$20 for antibiotics and $20-$50 for painkillers\n- Pharmacy availability is widespread, with many pharmacies located in cities and towns\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the local emergency number, 110, or visit the nearest hospital.
