[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Sri Lanka is relatively affordable, with a wide range of options available to suit different budgets and preferences. Typical lease terms in Sri Lanka are for a minimum of one year, with a two-month deposit required upfront. Tenant rights are protected under the Rent Act of Sri Lanka, which regulates the relationship between landlords and tenants. Compared to its regional neighbors, Sri Lanka's housing costs are relatively lower, making it an attractive option for expats and tourists. The country's housing market is also influenced by its growing economy and tourism industry, which has led to an increase in demand for rental properties, particularly in popular areas such as Colombo and Kandy.

The housing market in Sri Lanka is also characterized by a mix of traditional and modern housing options, with many new developments and apartment complexes being built in recent years. This has led to an increase in the availability of housing options, particularly in urban areas. However, the market can be competitive, and it is not uncommon for properties to be rented quickly, especially in popular areas. As a result, it is essential for renters to be prepared and to act quickly when they find a suitable property.
