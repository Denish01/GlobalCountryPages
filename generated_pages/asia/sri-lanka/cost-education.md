[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
Sri Lanka's education system is divided into public and private sectors, with the public sector being the largest and most widely accessible. The language of instruction in public schools is typically **Sinhala** or **Tamil**, while private schools often use **English** as the primary language. Compulsory education in Sri Lanka lasts for 13 years, from age 5 to 18, and is divided into primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. International schools are also available in Sri Lanka, particularly in the capital city of Colombo, offering a range of curricula including **International Baccalaureate**, **Cambridge**, and **Edexcel**.

The quality of education in Sri Lanka's public sector can vary depending on the location and resources available, with schools in urban areas tend to have better facilities and more qualified teachers. Private schools, on the other hand, often have smaller class sizes and more modern facilities, but can be expensive and out of reach for many Sri Lankan families. International schools in Sri Lanka offer a high-quality education and are popular among expat families, but can be very expensive, with annual fees ranging from $5,000 to $20,000 or more.
