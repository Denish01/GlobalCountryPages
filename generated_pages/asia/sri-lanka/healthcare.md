[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Sri Lanka's healthcare system is a mix of public and private providers, with the public sector offering free or low-cost services to all citizens. The public healthcare system is well-organized and provides a wide range of services, including primary care, specialty care, and emergency services. However, the quality of care and availability of facilities can vary significantly between urban and rural areas, with urban areas like Colombo and Kandy having better-equipped and staffed hospitals. The private sector, on the other hand, offers high-quality care, but at a higher cost, making it more accessible to those who can afford it.

The quality of care in Sri Lanka is generally good, with many hospitals and medical facilities meeting international standards. However, there can be shortages of certain medical supplies and equipment, especially in rural areas. Additionally, the healthcare system can be overcrowded, especially in public hospitals, which can lead to longer waiting times and reduced quality of care.

Despite these challenges, Sri Lanka has made significant progress in improving its healthcare system in recent years, with a focus on increasing access to healthcare services, especially in rural areas. The government has also implemented various initiatives to improve the quality of care, including training programs for healthcare professionals and investments in new medical equipment and technology.
