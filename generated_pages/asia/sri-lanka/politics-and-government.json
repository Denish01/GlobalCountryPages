  "content": "Sri Lanka is governed as a **unitary semi-presidential constitutional republic**, with a system that combines elements of a presidential and parliamentary system, where the President serves as both the head of state and head of government, while also having a Prime Minister who is responsible for advising the President.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nGovernment Type: Unitary Semi-Presidential Constitutional Republic\nHead of State: President (Ranil Wickremesinghe)\nHead of Government: President (Ranil Wickremesinghe)\nLegislature: Parliament of Sri Lanka, unicameral with 225 seats\nLegal System: Mixed law, with elements of common law, civil law, and customary law\nPolitical Stability Index: Ranked 60th out of 163 countries in the 2022 Global Peace Index\nCorruption Index: Ranked 102nd out of 180 countries in the 2022 Corruption Perceptions Index\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]\nThe government of Sri Lanka is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **executive branch** is headed by the President, who is both the head of state and head of government. The President is directly elected by the people for a term of five years and has significant powers, including the ability to appoint the Prime Minister, ministers, and other high-ranking officials. The **legislative branch** is composed of a unicameral Parliament, which has 225 seats and is elected by proportional representation for a term of five years. The **judicial branch** is independent and composed of the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal, and subordinate courts.\n\nThe system of government in Sri Lanka is designed to provide a balance of power between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The **separation of powers** is intended to prevent any one branch from becoming too powerful, and to ensure that each branch has checks and balances on the others. For example, the President has the power to appoint judges, but the Parliament has the power to impeach them. The Parliament also has the power to pass laws, but the President has the power to veto them.\n\nThe government of Sri Lanka is also characterized by a **unitary system**, where the central government has significant powers and the provinces have limited autonomy. This has been a subject of controversy, particularly among the minority Tamil population, who have called for greater autonomy and recognition of their rights.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | President's Office | President | Head of state and head of government |\n| Executive | Cabinet of Ministers | Prime Minister | Advises the President and oversees government ministries |\n| Legislative | Parliament of Sri Lanka | Speaker of the Parliament | Makes laws and exercises parliamentary control over the executive |\n| Judicial | Supreme Court of Sri Lanka | Chief Justice | Interprets the constitution and laws |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Major Political Parties [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Party | Position | Leader | Seats | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) | Center-right | Mahinda Rajapaksa | 145 | Nationalist and populist party |\n| United National Party (UNP) | Center-right | Ranil Wickremesinghe | 61 | Liberal and pro-market party |\n| Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) | Left-wing | Anura Kumara Dissanayaka | 3 | Marxist and nationalist party |\n| Tamil National Alliance (TNA) | Center-left | R.
