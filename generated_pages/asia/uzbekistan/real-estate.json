The market is characterized by a mix of old and new buildings, with a growing demand for modern apartments and commercial spaces. The current market conditions are favorable for buyers, with a wide range of properties available at competitive prices. However, the market is still developing, and buyers should be aware of the potential risks and challenges associated with investing in a emerging market. The price trajectory is generally upward, with prices increasing by 10-15% per year in urban areas. Urban areas such as Tashkent and Samarkand are more expensive than rural areas, where prices are lower and the market is less developed.\n\nThe government has implemented various initiatives to stimulate the property market, including the creation of special economic zones and the introduction of incentives for foreign investors. These initiatives have helped to attract foreign investment and stimulate economic growth, which in turn has driven demand for property. However, the market is still subject to certain risks and challenges, including a lack of transparency and corruption. Buyers should therefore exercise caution and conduct thorough research before making a purchase.\n\nThe property market in Uzbekistan is also characterized by a strong demand for rental properties, particularly in urban areas. Many foreigners and locals are looking for modern apartments and houses to rent, which has driven up rental yields and made the market attractive to investors. However, the rental market is still relatively underdeveloped, and buyers should be aware of the potential risks and challenges associated with renting out properties.\n\n[SECTION] Prices by Area [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area/City | Buy (per sqm, USD) | Rent (monthly, USD) | Type |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Tashkent | 500 | 200 | Apartment |\n| Samarkand | 300 | 150 | House |\n| Bukhara | 250 | 100 | Apartment |\n| Khiva | 200 | 80 | House |\n| Fergana | 150 | 60 | Apartment |\n| Andijan | 100 | 50 | House |\n| Namangan | 80 | 40 | Apartment |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Ownership Rules [/SECTION]\n- Foreigners can buy property in Uzbekistan, but they must obtain a residence permit or register with the Ministry of Internal Affairs.\n- Foreign companies can also buy property, but they must be registered with the State Committee on Investment.\n- Foreigners can lease property for up to 50 years, with the option to extend the lease.\n- Foreigners must obtain a permit from the State Committee on Architecture and Construction to buy or lease property.\n- Foreigners must also comply with Uzbekistan's tax laws and regulations, including paying an annual property tax of 1.5%.\n\n[SECTION] Buying Process [/SECTION]\n1.
