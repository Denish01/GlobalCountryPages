Uzbekistan has undergone significant transformations in recent years, making it a more welcoming and secure destination for visitors. The country has a low crime rate compared to other nations, and the government has implemented various measures to ensure tourist safety. However, as with any foreign travel, it is essential to take necessary precautions and be aware of potential risks. Uzbekistan's reputation for hospitality is well-deserved, with locals often going out of their way to assist and welcome visitors.
