[SECTION] How Uzbekistan Is Divided [/SECTION]
Uzbekistan's administrative structure is divided into 12 provinces, also known as viloyats, which are further divided into districts, known as tuman. The provinces are Andijan, Bukhara, Fergana, Jizzakh, Kashkadarya, Khorezm, Namangan, Navoiy, Samarkand, Sirdarya, Surkhandarya, and Tashkent. The autonomous republic of Karakalpakstan is located in the northwest of the country and has its own government. The capital city, Tashkent, has a special status and is not part of any province. This administrative structure allows for a decentralized approach to governance, with each province having its own capital and administrative center.

The division of Uzbekistan into provinces and regions is based on geographical, historical, and cultural factors. The provinces are responsible for managing local affairs, such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure development, while the central government is responsible for national policies and decision-making. This system allows for a balance between regional autonomy and national unity, enabling Uzbekistan to maintain its cultural diversity and regional characteristics.
