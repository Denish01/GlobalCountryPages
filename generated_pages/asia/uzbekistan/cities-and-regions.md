[SECTION] How Uzbekistan Is Divided [/SECTION]
Uzbekistan's administrative structure is based on a system of provinces, known as viloyats, which are further divided into districts, or tuman. The country is comprised of 12 provinces, including Andijan, Bukhara, Fergana, Jizzakh, Kashkadarya, Khorezm, Namangan, Navoiy, Samarkand, Sirdarya, Surkhandarya, and Tashkent, as well as the autonomous Republic of Karakalpakstan and the independent city of Tashkent. This system allows for a degree of regional autonomy, while also maintaining a strong central government.

The provinces are responsible for managing local affairs, such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure, while the central government handles matters of national importance, including foreign policy, defense, and economic development. This division of power has allowed Uzbekistan to maintain a balance between regional autonomy and national unity, while also promoting economic growth and development.
