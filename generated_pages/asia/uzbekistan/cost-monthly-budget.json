The cost of living in Uzbekistan is approximately 30-50% lower than in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, making it an attractive destination for expats and travelers. With a budget of $400 per month, you can live a modest lifestyle, while $700 per month would provide a more comfortable mid-range lifestyle, and $1,200 per month would offer a relatively high standard of living.\n\nThe affordability of Uzbekistan is largely due to its low cost of accommodation, food, and transportation. However, the cost of healthcare and education can be relatively high, especially for private services. Additionally, the inflation rate of 9.6% in 2024 may affect the purchasing power of your money, so it's essential to factor this into your budget.
