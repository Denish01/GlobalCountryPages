[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Uzbekistan is structured into three main levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary education. Primary education, also known as **maktab**, lasts for four years and is compulsory for all children from the age of six. Secondary education, or **litsey**, is divided into two stages: general secondary education and vocational education, and lasts for eight years. Tertiary education is provided by universities and institutes, and typically lasts for four to five years. The quality of education in Uzbekistan has improved significantly in recent years, with the government investing heavily in the sector. Public education is free and compulsory for all citizens, while private education is also available, although it is not as widespread.

The education system in Uzbekistan is overseen by the Ministry of Higher and Secondary Specialized Education, which is responsible for setting the curriculum and standards for all educational institutions. The ministry has implemented various reforms in recent years, including the introduction of a new curriculum and the development of new teaching methods. The government has also invested in the development of **information technology** and **foreign language** education, in order to better prepare students for the modern job market.

Despite the progress made, the education system in Uzbekistan still faces several challenges, including a lack of resources and infrastructure in some rural areas, and a shortage of qualified teachers. The government has launched various initiatives to address these challenges, including the development of new teacher training programs and the construction of new schools and universities.
