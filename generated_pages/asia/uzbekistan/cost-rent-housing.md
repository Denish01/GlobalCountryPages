[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Uzbekistan's rental market is relatively affordable, with a wide range of options available for expats and locals alike. Typical lease terms in Uzbekistan are for one year, with a deposit requirement of one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are generally protected under Uzbek law, with provisions for rent control and eviction procedures. Compared to its regional neighbors, Uzbekistan's housing costs are relatively low, with Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan being more expensive, while Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan are generally more affordable. The country's housing market is also influenced by its growing economy, with a GDP per capita PPP of $11,879, and an inflation rate of 9.6%, which can impact the affordability of housing.

The housing market in Uzbekistan is also influenced by the country's cultural and social norms, with many families preferring to live in traditional **mahalla** neighborhoods, which are characterized by narrow streets and close-knit communities. Expats, on the other hand, often prefer to live in more modern areas, such as the city center, which offers a range of amenities and services. The government has also implemented various initiatives to improve the housing market, including the development of new residential areas and the renovation of existing housing stock.
