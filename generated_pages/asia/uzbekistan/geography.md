[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Uzbekistan is situated in the heart of Central Asia, sharing borders with Kazakhstan to the north, Kyrgyzstan to the northeast, Tajikistan to the southeast, Afghanistan to the south, and Turkmenistan to the southwest. The country is landlocked, meaning it does not have any direct access to the ocean, and its terrain is characterized by a mix of mountains, deserts, and rivers. The location of Uzbekistan has made it an important stop on the historic Silk Road, a network of trade routes that connected Europe and Asia.

The country's borders are defined by natural features such as mountains and rivers, as well as by international agreements. The border with Kazakhstan, for example, is marked by the **Mugodzhar Mountains**, while the border with Afghanistan is defined by the **Amu Darya River**. Uzbekistan's strategic location has made it an important player in regional trade and politics, and its borders have been the subject of numerous agreements and treaties over the years.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Uzbekistan's terrain is characterized by a mix of mountains, deserts, and rivers. The **Tian Shan Mountains** and the **Pamir Mountains** are two of the main mountain ranges in the country, with peaks reaching elevations of over 4,000 meters. The mountains are home to several **glaciers** and **rivers**, including the **Syr Darya River** and the **Amu Darya River**, which are the main sources of water for the country. The **Kyzylkum Desert**, which covers much of western Uzbekistan, is one of the largest deserts in the world and is known for its extreme heat and dryness.

The country's landscape is also marked by several **oases**, which are fertile areas surrounded by desert. The **Fergana Valley**, for example, is a large oasis that is home to several cities and towns, including the city of Fergana. The valley is known for its rich soil and mild climate, making it an important center for agriculture. Uzbekistan's terrain and landscape have played a major role in shaping the country's history and culture, with many of its cities and towns developing around oases and trade routes.

The **Aralkum Desert**, which was once the bed of the **Aral Sea**, is another notable feature of Uzbekistan's landscape. The Aral Sea was once the world's fourth-largest lake, but it has largely dried up due to the diversion of the rivers that fed it. The resulting desert is now a major environmental concern, with high levels of salt and pollution making it difficult for plants and animals to survive.
