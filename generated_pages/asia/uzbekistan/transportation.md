[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Uzbekistan has several international airports, with Tashkent International Airport being the largest and most convenient entry point, offering direct flights to major hubs such as Moscow, Istanbul, and Dubai. Other international airports include Samarkand, Bukhara, and Urgench, which receive flights from neighboring countries and some European destinations. If you prefer to enter the country overland, you can cross the border from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, or Turkmenistan by car, bus, or train, with the most popular routes being from Almaty, Kazakhstan, and Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan.

The main overland entry points are the border crossings at Gisht-Kuprik, Jibek Joli, and Sariasia, which connect Uzbekistan to its neighboring countries. These border crossings can be busy, especially during peak travel seasons, so it's essential to plan ahead and research the required documents and procedures. Additionally, some border crossings may have limited hours of operation or be closed due to security concerns, so it's crucial to check the current situation before embarking on your journey.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Uzbekistan has an extensive domestic air network, with several airlines operating flights between major cities, including Uzbekistan Airways, the national carrier. The main domestic routes connect Tashkent to Samarkand, Bukhara, Urgench, and Fergana, with flights operating several times a day. Booking domestic flights can be done online through the airlines' websites or at local travel agencies, and it's recommended to book in advance to secure the best prices. Approximate costs for domestic flights range from $20 to $100, depending on the route and airline.

When booking domestic flights, it's essential to consider the luggage restrictions and check-in procedures, as these may vary depending on the airline and route.

Train travel is a convenient and relatively affordable way to get around Uzbekistan, with prices ranging from $5 to $50, depending on the route and class of service.

The high-speed trains, known as **Afrosiyob**, operate between Tashkent and Samarkand, and offer a comfortable and efficient way to travel between these two major cities.
