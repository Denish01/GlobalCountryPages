[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Uzbekistan's healthcare system is a mixed model, combining elements of public and private healthcare. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, leading to a shortage of medical supplies and equipment. However, in recent years, the government has made efforts to improve the public healthcare system, including investing in new medical facilities and equipment. Private healthcare options are also available, particularly in urban areas, and offer higher quality care, but at a significantly higher cost. The quality of care varies greatly between urban and rural areas, with urban areas generally having better equipped and staffed hospitals. Rural areas often lack access to basic medical care, and residents may have to travel long distances to receive medical attention.

The public healthcare system is generally free or low-cost for citizens, but the quality of care is often poor. Private healthcare options are available, but are generally expensive and out of reach for many citizens. Foreigners and expats often opt for private healthcare options, which offer higher quality care and more English-speaking staff. However, even in private hospitals, the quality of care can be variable, and medical supplies and equipment may be in short supply.

Despite the challenges, Uzbekistan has made significant progress in improving its healthcare system in recent years. The government has implemented various reforms aimed at increasing access to healthcare, particularly in rural areas. Additionally, the country has seen an increase in the number of medical tourists, with many foreigners coming to Uzbekistan for dental and cosmetic procedures.
