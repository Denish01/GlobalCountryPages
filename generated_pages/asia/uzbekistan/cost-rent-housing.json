Typical lease terms in Uzbekistan are for one year, with a deposit requirement of one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are generally protected under Uzbek law, with provisions for rent control and eviction procedures. Compared to its regional neighbors, Uzbekistan's housing costs are relatively low, with Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan being more expensive, while Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan are generally more affordable. The country's housing market is also influenced by its growing economy, with a GDP per capita PPP of $11,879, and an inflation rate of 9.6%, which can impact the affordability of housing.\n\nThe housing market in Uzbekistan is also influenced by the country's cultural and social norms, with many families preferring to live in traditional **mahalla** neighborhoods, which are characterized by narrow streets and close-knit communities. Expats, on the other hand, often prefer to live in more modern areas, such as the city center, which offers a range of amenities and services. The government has also implemented various initiatives to improve the housing market, including the development of new residential areas and the renovation of existing housing stock.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $200-$350 | $100-$200 | (basic amenities) |\n| 1 Bedroom | $250-$450 | $150-$300 | (standard furniture) |\n| 2 Bedroom | $350-$600 | $250-$450 | (family size, some amenities) |\n| 3 Bedroom | $500-$900 | $350-$600 | (spacious, modern amenities) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $1,500-$3,000 | (prime locations, modern amenities) |\n| Suburbs | $800-$1,500 | (residential areas, some amenities) |\n| Rural | $200-$500 | (limited amenities, traditional housing) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Sobir Rahimov** neighborhood in Tashkent: $300-$500 USD per month for a one-bedroom apartment, known for its modern amenities and close proximity to the city center.\n- **Chilanzar** neighborhood in Tashkent: $250-$400 USD per month for a one-bedroom apartment, a popular area for expats and locals alike, with a range of amenities and services available.\n- **Mirzo Ulugbek** neighborhood in Tashkent: $200-$350 USD per month for a one-bedroom apartment, a historic area with a mix of traditional and modern housing.\n- **Yunusabad** neighborhood in Tashkent: $150-$300 USD per month for a one-bedroom apartment, a residential area with a range of amenities and services available.\n- **Parkent** neighborhood in Tashkent: $100-$250 USD per month for a one-bedroom apartment, a scenic area with a mix of modern and traditional housing.\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Uzbekistan [/SECTION]\n- Research different neighborhoods and areas to find the best fit for your budget and lifestyle.\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent or property manager to find a reliable landlord and a suitable apartment.\n- Be prepared to negotiate the rent and terms of the lease.\n- Check the condition of the apartment and the building before signing the lease.\n- Consider hiring a translator or interpreter to help with communication and paperwork.\n- Be aware of scams and fake listings, and never send money or sign a lease without seeing the apartment in person.",
