# Uzbekistan Visa & Entry Requirements

You will likely need a visa to enter Uzbekistan, but the requirements vary depending on your nationality and the purpose of your visit.

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Uzbekistan has a moderate visa policy, with a growing list of countries eligible for visa-free access or electronic visas. As of the latest updates, citizens of over 60 countries can enter Uzbekistan without a visa, while others can obtain an electronic visa or a visa on arrival. The Uzbek government has been working to simplify the visa process and attract more tourists to the country.

The visa policy is designed to balance the need to control immigration with the desire to promote tourism and economic development. Uzbekistan offers various types of visas, including tourist, business, and transit visas, each with its own set of requirements and restrictions. The government has also introduced an electronic visa system, which allows citizens of eligible countries to apply for a visa online and receive it via email.
