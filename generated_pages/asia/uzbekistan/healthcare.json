  "content": "Healthcare in Uzbekistan is a mixed system that provides both public and private options, with varying levels of quality and access, particularly between urban and rural areas.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nQuality Rating: 2/5\nEmergency Number: 103\nHospital Standard: Basic\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: widespread\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nUzbekistan's healthcare system is a mixed model, combining elements of public and private healthcare. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, leading to a shortage of medical supplies and equipment. However, in recent years, the government has made efforts to improve the public healthcare system, including investing in new medical facilities and equipment. Private healthcare options are also available, particularly in urban areas, and offer higher quality care, but at a significantly higher cost. The quality of care varies greatly between urban and rural areas, with urban areas generally having better equipped and staffed hospitals. Rural areas often lack access to basic medical care, and residents may have to travel long distances to receive medical attention.\n\nThe public healthcare system is generally free or low-cost for citizens, but the quality of care is often poor. Private healthcare options are available, but are generally expensive and out of reach for many citizens. Foreigners and expats often opt for private healthcare options, which offer higher quality care and more English-speaking staff. However, even in private hospitals, the quality of care can be variable, and medical supplies and equipment may be in short supply.\n\nDespite the challenges, Uzbekistan has made significant progress in improving its healthcare system in recent years. The government has implemented various reforms aimed at increasing access to healthcare, particularly in rural areas. Additionally, the country has seen an increase in the number of medical tourists, with many foreigners coming to Uzbekistan for dental and cosmetic procedures.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Tashkent International Medical Clinic | Tashkent | Private | General practice, cardiology, dentistry | Yes |\n| Uzbek-Japanese Center for Medical Research | Tashkent | Public | Research, cardiology, oncology | Limited |\n| Samarkand Regional Hospital | Samarkand | Public | General practice, surgery, obstetrics | Limited |\n| Bukhara Medical Center | Bukhara | Private | General practice, cardiology, pediatrics | Yes |\n| Khorezm Regional Hospital | Urgench | Public | General practice, surgery, obstetrics | Limited |\n| Inha University Hospital | Tashkent | Private | General practice, cardiology, neurology | Yes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- Foreigners and expats are recommended to have private health insurance that covers them in Uzbekistan, as the public healthcare system may not provide adequate care.\n- Local insurance options are available, but may not provide the same level of coverage as international insurance plans.\n- Expats and foreigners may be required to show proof of health insurance in order to obtain a visa or residence permit.\n- The cost of health insurance in Uzbekistan can vary greatly, depending on the provider and level of coverage.\n- Some employers may offer health insurance as part of their benefits package, but this is not always the case.\n- It is recommended to research and compare different health insurance plans before making a decision, in order to find the best option for your needs and budget.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- Medications are widely available in Uzbekistan, particularly in urban areas.\n- Many medications are available over-the-counter, without a prescription.\n- However, the quality and authenticity of medications can vary, and it is recommended to only purchase medications from reputable pharmacies.\n- Prescription medications may require a prescription from a local doctor, and may not be available in all areas.\n- The cost of medications in Uzbekistan can be relatively low, particularly for generic medications.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- Vaccinations against hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and typhoid fever are recommended for travel to Uzbekistan.\n- Vaccinations against rabies and Japanese encephalitis may also be recommended, depending on the specific circumstances of your trip.\n- Uzbekistan is at risk for various diseases, including malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS.\n- Water and food safety can be a concern, particularly in rural areas, and it is recommended to take precautions to avoid illness.\n- It is also recommended to take precautions against insect-borne illnesses, such as mosquitoes and ticks.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- Uzbekistan is becoming increasingly popular as a destination for medical tourism, particularly for dental and cosmetic procedures.\n- The country offers a range of medical procedures, including dental implants, cosmetic surgery, and orthopedic surgery.\n- Accredited hospitals and clinics are available, particularly in Tashkent and other major cities.\n- The cost of medical procedures in Uzbekistan can be significantly lower than in other countries, making it an attractive option for medical tourists.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- In the event of an emergency, it is recommended to call the emergency number, 103, or to go to the nearest hospital.\n- Ambulance services are available, but may not be reliable, particularly in rural areas.\n- It is recommended to have a plan in place in case of an emergency, including knowing the location of the nearest hospital and having a means of transportation.\n- Insurance claims can be complex, and it is recommended to have a clear understanding of your insurance policy and what is covered.\n- It is also recommended to have a list of emergency contact numbers, including your embassy and insurance provider.",
