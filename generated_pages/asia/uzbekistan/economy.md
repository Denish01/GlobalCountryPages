The country has undergone significant economic reforms since gaining independence in 1991, including the introduction of a new currency, the Uzbekistan som, and the gradual liberalization of trade and investment policies. As a result, Uzbekistan has experienced rapid economic growth, with GDP increasing by an average of 8% per year over the past decade. The country's economy is classified as upper-middle-income, with a GDP per capita of over $1,500.

Uzbekistan's economic development has been driven by a combination of factors, including large-scale investment in infrastructure, the expansion of the manufacturing sector, and the growth of the services industry. The country has also made significant progress in reducing poverty and improving living standards, with the poverty rate declining from over 30% in the early 2000s to less than 10% today. However, despite these achievements, Uzbekistan still faces significant economic challenges, including a large trade deficit and a reliance on imports to meet domestic demand.

The government has implemented a range of policies aimed at diversifying the economy and reducing dependence on imports, including the development of the manufacturing sector and the promotion of foreign investment. These efforts have been supported by international organizations such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which have provided technical assistance and financing to support Uzbekistan's economic development.
