[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Uzbekistan's healthcare system is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. Public healthcare facilities are generally less expensive than private ones, but the quality of care can vary significantly. Locals often rely on public facilities for basic medical needs, while foreigners and those who can afford it tend to opt for private clinics and hospitals, which offer better equipment, trained staff, and shorter waiting times. The healthcare system is generally underfunded, and patients often need to pay out-of-pocket for medications, tests, and other services. Having health insurance is not mandatory, but it is highly recommended, especially for foreigners, as it can help cover the cost of medical care and provide access to better facilities.

The quality of healthcare in Uzbekistan's public sector is often criticized for being inadequate, with outdated equipment, limited resources, and a shortage of skilled medical professionals. In contrast, private healthcare facilities are generally better equipped and staffed, but they can be expensive, and the cost of services is often not covered by local insurance plans. For foreigners, it is essential to have international health insurance that covers them in Uzbekistan, as local insurance plans may not provide adequate coverage. Additionally, many private hospitals and clinics in Uzbekistan have partnerships with international insurance providers, making it easier for foreigners to access quality healthcare.

[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]
In the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the local emergency number, 103, or seek immediate attention at the nearest hospital. Ambulance services are available, but they may not always be reliable or equipped with modern medical equipment. For foreigners, it is recommended to have a list of emergency contact numbers, including your embassy and insurance provider, in case of an emergency. The best hospitals for foreigners in Uzbekistan are generally private hospitals, such as the Tashkent International Medical Clinic or the Uzbek-Japanese Center for Medical Cooperation, which offer better equipment, trained staff, and more comprehensive services. However, even in private hospitals, the quality of care can vary, and it is essential to have health insurance that covers emergency medical evacuations, if necessary.

In the event of a serious medical emergency, it may be necessary to evacuate to a nearby country, such as Kazakhstan or Turkey, which have better-equipped medical facilities and more specialized services. This can be a costly and complex process, and it is essential to have health insurance that covers emergency evacuations and repatriations. Additionally, it is recommended to research local medical facilities and emergency services before traveling to Uzbekistan and to have a plan in place in case of an emergency. This can include having a list of emergency contact numbers, knowing the location of the nearest hospital, and having a basic first aid kit with essential medications and supplies.
