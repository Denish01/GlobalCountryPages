The provinces are Andijan, Bukhara, Fergana, Jizzakh, Kashkadarya, Khorezm, Namangan, Navoiy, Samarkand, Sirdarya, Surkhandarya, and Tashkent. The autonomous republic of Karakalpakstan is located in the northwest of the country and has its own government. The capital city, Tashkent, has a special status and is not part of any province. This administrative structure allows for a decentralized approach to governance, with each province having its own capital and administrative center.\n\nThe division of Uzbekistan into provinces and regions is based on geographical, historical, and cultural factors. The provinces are responsible for managing local affairs, such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure development, while the central government is responsible for national policies and decision-making. This system allows for a balance between regional autonomy and national unity, enabling Uzbekistan to maintain its cultural diversity and regional characteristics.\n\n[SECTION] Major Cities [/SECTION]\n**Tashkent** (population estimate 2.5 million)\nRole: capital, economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: its modern architecture, vibrant markets, and rich cultural heritage\nBest For: visitors interested in history, culture, and urban life\n\n**Samarkand** (population estimate 540,000)\nRole: cultural center, historical city\nKnown For: its stunning architecture, rich history, and vibrant markets\nBest For: visitors interested in history, culture, and architecture\n\n**Bukhara** (population estimate 280,000)\nRole: cultural center, historical city\nKnown For: its well-preserved ancient architecture, rich history, and traditional crafts\nBest For: visitors interested in history, culture, and traditional crafts\n\n**Namangan** (population estimate 640,000)\nRole: economic hub, industrial center\nKnown For: its textile industry, agricultural production, and natural resources\nBest For: visitors interested in industry, trade, and commerce\n\n**Andijan** (population estimate 430,000)\nRole: economic hub, industrial center\nKnown For: its agricultural production, natural resources, and traditional crafts\nBest For: visitors interested in industry, trade, and traditional crafts\n\n**Nukus** (population estimate 310,000)\nRole: cultural center, capital of Karakalpakstan\nKnown For: its unique cultural heritage, traditional music, and stunning natural scenery\nBest For: visitors interested in culture, music, and nature\n\n[SECTION] Key Regions [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Region | Character | Known For | Major City |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fergana Valley | fertile valley, agricultural production | silk production, traditional crafts | Fergana |\n| Kyzylkum Desert | arid desert, natural resources | oil and gas production, mining | Navoiy |\n| Tian Shan Mountains | mountainous region, natural scenery | hiking, trekking, skiing | Tashkent |\n| Aral Sea Region | coastal region, natural scenery | fishing, boating, birdwatching | Nukus |\n| Samarkand Region | cultural region, historical city | architecture, history, traditional crafts | Samarkand |\n| Bukhara Region | cultural region, historical city | architecture, history, traditional crafts | Bukhara |\n| Karakalpakstan | autonomous republic, cultural region | unique cultural heritage, traditional music | Nukus |\n| Sirdarya Region | industrial region, economic hub | textile industry, agricultural production | Gulistan |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Differences [/SECTION]\n- The Fergana Valley is known for its fertile soil and agricultural production, with a strong focus on silk production and traditional crafts.\n- The Kyzylkum Desert is a major producer of oil and gas, with a growing mining industry.\n- The Tian Shan Mountains offer stunning natural scenery, with opportunities for hiking, trekking, and skiing.\n- The Aral Sea Region is a coastal area with a unique cultural heritage, known for its fishing industry, boating, and birdwatching.\n\n[SECTION] Getting Around [/SECTION]\nUzbekistan has a well-developed transportation network, with domestic flights, trains, and buses connecting major cities and regions.
