The country is comprised of 12 provinces, including Andijan, Bukhara, Fergana, Jizzakh, Kashkadarya, Khorezm, Namangan, Navoiy, Samarkand, Sirdarya, Surkhandarya, and Tashkent, as well as the autonomous Republic of Karakalpakstan and the independent city of Tashkent. This system allows for a degree of regional autonomy, while also maintaining a strong central government.\n\nThe provinces are responsible for managing local affairs, such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure, while the central government handles matters of national importance, including foreign policy, defense, and economic development.
