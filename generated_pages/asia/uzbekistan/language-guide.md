[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]
Uzbekistan's linguistic landscape is characterized by a mix of languages, with Uzbek being the dominant language spoken by the majority of the population. The country has a number of regional dialects, including the Tashkent dialect, which is considered the standard form of Uzbek. Russian is also widely spoken, particularly in urban areas, and is often used as a second language in business and government. Minority languages, such as Tajik and Kazakh, are also spoken in certain regions. English is becoming increasingly popular, particularly among the younger population, but it is still not widely spoken, and visitors may encounter difficulties communicating in English outside of major tourist areas.

The use of English in Uzbekistan is limited, and visitors may need to rely on translation apps or phrasebooks to communicate. However, many signs and menus are translated into English, and some tourist information is available in English. In general, it is a good idea to learn some basic Uzbek phrases, such as greetings and directions, to help navigate the country.

Uzbekistan's language policy has undergone significant changes in recent years, with a shift towards the use of the Latin alphabet instead of the Cyrillic alphabet, which was used during the Soviet era. This change has been implemented in an effort to modernize the language and make it more accessible to international communication.
