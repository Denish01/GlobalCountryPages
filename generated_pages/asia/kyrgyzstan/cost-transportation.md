[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Kyrgyzstan has a relatively underdeveloped transportation system, with most people relying on **public transportation** such as buses, minivans, and shared taxis to get around. The quality of public transit varies greatly between cities, with Bishkek having a more comprehensive network of buses and minivans compared to other cities. In rural areas, **private cars** and **taxis** are often the primary mode of transportation due to the lack of public transit options.

The country's mountainous terrain and limited road network make traveling by car or bus challenging, especially during the winter months. However, the scenic routes and stunning landscapes make traveling through Kyrgyzstan a unique and rewarding experience. Many tourists and locals alike use **hitchhiking** as a mode of transportation, especially in rural areas where public transit is scarce. Additionally, **cycling** and **hiking** are popular ways to explore the country's natural beauty, with many tour operators offering guided tours and bike rentals.
