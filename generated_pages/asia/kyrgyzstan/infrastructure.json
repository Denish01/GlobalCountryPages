  "content": "The infrastructure in Kyrgyzstan is still developing, with significant investments being made in recent years to improve the country's roads, energy sector, and telecommunications, but still facing challenges in providing equal access to services in urban and rural areas. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 100% of population\nInternet Penetration: 38%\nRoad Network: 34,000 km, with 90% paved\nRail Network: 470 km\nMajor Airports: 4\nMajor Ports: landlocked, with no major ports\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nKyrgyzstan's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other countries in the region, but the government has been actively investing in various sectors to improve the overall quality of life and attract foreign investment. Recent investments have focused on improving the country's road network, increasing access to electricity and clean water, and expanding telecommunications services. However, there is still a significant gap between urban and rural areas, with cities like Bishkek enjoying better infrastructure and services compared to rural towns and villages. The government has been working to address this issue through targeted development projects and investments in rural areas.\n\nThe country's infrastructure development is also influenced by its geographical location, with Kyrgyzstan being a landlocked country surrounded by mountains. This poses significant challenges for the construction and maintenance of roads, railways, and other infrastructure, and requires careful planning and investment to ensure that the country remains connected to the rest of the world. Despite these challenges, Kyrgyzstan has made significant progress in recent years, and the country is expected to continue investing in its infrastructure in the coming years.\n\nKyrgyzstan's infrastructure development is also closely tied to its economic development, with the government recognizing the importance of a well-developed infrastructure in attracting foreign investment and promoting economic growth. As a result, the government has been working to create a favorable business environment and to promote investment in key sectors such as energy, transportation, and telecommunications. This has included the establishment of special economic zones and the introduction of incentives for foreign investors, and has helped to attract investment from countries such as China, Russia, and the United States.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 34,000 km | Moderate | 90% paved, but some roads in poor condition |\n| Railways | 470 km | Poor | limited network and old infrastructure |\n| Airports | 4 international, 14 domestic | Good | modern facilities and equipment |\n| Ports | none | - | landlocked country, relies on neighboring countries' ports |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- **Hydropower** is the main source of electricity generation in Kyrgyzstan, accounting for over 90% of the country's power generation\n- The country's energy sector is relatively reliable, with few **power outages** reported in recent years\n- However, the energy sector still faces challenges, including **aging infrastructure** and a lack of investment in new generation capacity\n- Kyrgyzstan has set ambitious targets for **renewable energy**, aiming to increase the share of renewables in the energy mix to 30% by 2030\n- The country is also exploring opportunities for **energy exports**, with plans to export excess electricity to neighboring countries\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water safety** is a concern in some areas, with many households relying on **well water** or **bottled water** for drinking\n- **Sanitation coverage** is relatively high, with over 90% of the population having access to improved sanitation facilities\n- However, **water access** remains a challenge in rural areas, with many households lacking access to piped water\n- The government has been investing in **water infrastructure**, including the construction of new water treatment plants and the rehabilitation of existing facilities\n- **Wastewater management** is also a concern, with many cities and towns lacking adequate wastewater treatment facilities\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is relatively high, with over 90% of the population having access to mobile phone services\n- **Fiber-optic broadband** is available in major cities, but **internet penetration** remains relatively low at around 38%\n- The government has been investing in **4G/5G rollout**, with several mobile operators already offering 4G services in major cities\n- **Postal services** are available throughout the country, but are not as widely used as other forms of communication\n- The country is also home to a number of **IT companies**, with a growing tech industry and a number of startups and innovation hubs\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The **China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway** project, which aims to connect Kyrgyzstan to the Chinese rail network and improve trade links with neighboring countries\n- The **CAREC Transport Corridor**, a regional project aimed at improving transport links and promoting economic growth in Central Asia\n- The **Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan-Tajikistan power transmission line**, which aims to improve energy cooperation and promote regional energy trade\n- The **Bishkek water supply project**, which aims to improve access to clean water and sanitation in the capital city\n- The **Digital Kyrgyzstan** project, which aims to promote the development of the country's IT sector and improve access to digital services throughout the country",
