[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Kyrgyzstan has a mixed healthcare system, with both public and private facilities available. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, with limited resources and outdated equipment. However, it is more affordable and accessible to the general population. On the other hand, private healthcare facilities offer better quality services and equipment, but are more expensive and often cater to foreigners and affluent locals. For locals, the public healthcare system is the primary source of medical care, while foreigners often opt for private facilities due to language barriers and higher standards of care. It is recommended to have insurance to cover medical expenses, especially for foreigners, as the cost of healthcare can be high and unpredictable.

The healthcare system in Kyrgyzstan is also plagued by corruption and bureaucracy, which can make it difficult to access quality medical care. Additionally, there is a shortage of skilled medical professionals, particularly in rural areas. Despite these challenges, the government has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, including increasing funding and implementing reforms to make healthcare more accessible and affordable. For example, the government has introduced a mandatory health insurance program for citizens, which covers basic medical services and provides financial protection against catastrophic health expenditures.

[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]
- Common medications such as antibiotics and painkillers are widely available and relatively affordable, with prices ranging from $5-10 per prescription.
- Prescription rules are generally lax, and many medications can be purchased over-the-counter without a prescription.
- Pharmacies are widely available in urban areas, but may be scarce in rural areas.
- Medication prices vary depending on the brand and quality, with generic medications often being cheaper than brand-name medications.
- Some medications, such as those for chronic conditions, may be difficult to find or expensive.
- It is recommended to bring any necessary medications with you when traveling to Kyrgyzstan, as they may be difficult to find or expensive to purchase locally.

[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]
In the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the local emergency number, 103, or seek immediate attention at the nearest hospital. Ambulance services are available, but may be limited in rural areas. The best hospitals for foreigners are often private hospitals, which offer more advanced equipment and services. For example, the **American-style** hospital in Bishkek offers high-quality medical care and services, including emergency room services and surgeries. It is also recommended to have insurance that covers emergency medical evacuations, as the cost of transportation to a nearby country with better medical facilities can be high. Additionally, it is a good idea to research and identify the nearest and best hospitals before a medical emergency occurs, and to keep a list of emergency contact numbers and hospital locations handy.
