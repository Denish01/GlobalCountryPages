# Kyrgyzstan Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

The infrastructure in Kyrgyzstan is still developing, with significant investments being made in recent years to improve the country's roads, energy sector, and telecommunications, but still facing challenges in providing equal access to services in urban and rural areas. 

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 100% of population
Internet Penetration: 38%
Road Network: 34,000 km, with 90% paved
Rail Network: 470 km
Major Airports: 4
Major Ports: landlocked, with no major ports
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Kyrgyzstan's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other countries in the region, but the government has been actively investing in various sectors to improve the overall quality of life and attract foreign investment. Recent investments have focused on improving the country's road network, increasing access to electricity and clean water, and expanding telecommunications services. However, there is still a significant gap between urban and rural areas, with cities like Bishkek enjoying better infrastructure and services compared to rural towns and villages. The government has been working to address this issue through targeted development projects and investments in rural areas.

The country's infrastructure development is also influenced by its geographical location, with Kyrgyzstan being a landlocked country surrounded by mountains. This poses significant challenges for the construction and maintenance of roads, railways, and other infrastructure, and requires careful planning and investment to ensure that the country remains connected to the rest of the world. Despite these challenges, Kyrgyzstan has made significant progress in recent years, and the country is expected to continue investing in its infrastructure in the coming years.

Kyrgyzstan's infrastructure development is also closely tied to its economic development, with the government recognizing the importance of a well-developed infrastructure in attracting foreign investment and promoting economic growth. As a result, the government has been working to create a favorable business environment and to promote investment in key sectors such as energy, transportation, and telecommunications. This has included the establishment of special economic zones and the introduction of incentives for foreign investors, and has helped to attract investment from countries such as China, Russia, and the United States.
