[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in Kyrgyzstan has improved significantly over the past decade, with the average internet speed increasing to 10 Mbps download. However, there is still a significant urban vs rural divide, with faster and more reliable internet connections available in cities like Bishkek and Osh, while rural areas often have slower and less reliable connections. The reliability of the internet can also be affected by the weather, with heavy rain or snow sometimes causing outages. Despite these challenges, the internet is widely available and is an essential part of daily life in Kyrgyzstan, with many people using it to stay in touch with friends and family, access information, and conduct business.

The Kyrgyz government has made efforts to improve the internet infrastructure, including the launch of several new fiber-optic cables and the expansion of mobile network coverage to more rural areas. As a result, the internet is now more widely available and affordable, with many internet service providers offering a range of plans and packages to suit different needs and budgets. However, the internet is not always reliable, and outages can occur, especially during peak hours or in areas with high demand.

[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]
Getting a SIM card in Kyrgyzstan is relatively easy, with many mobile network operators offering tourist-friendly plans and packages. The main carriers, including Beeline, Megacom, and O!, have outlets at the airport and in major cities, where tourists can purchase a SIM card and register for a plan. To purchase a SIM card, tourists will need to provide their passport and a photocopy of their visa, if required. The cost of a SIM card is approximately 5 USD, and data plans start from around 10 USD per month for 1 GB of data.

The recommended carriers for tourists are Beeline and Megacom, which offer a range of plans and packages, including tourist-friendly options with unlimited data and international calls. O! is also a popular option, with a range of plans and packages available, including some with unlimited data and social media access.
