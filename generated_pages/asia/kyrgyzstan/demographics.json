The country has a relatively young population, with a median age of 26.5 years, which has implications for its labor market and economic development. The population growth rate is approximately 1.1%, which is relatively low compared to other countries in the region. Urbanization is also a significant trend in Kyrgyzstan, with about 36.4% of the population living in urban areas. The capital city, Bishkek, is the largest urban center, with a population of over 1 million people.\n\nThe population of Kyrgyzstan is also characterized by a high level of migration, both within the country and internationally. Many Kyrgyz citizens migrate to other countries, such as Russia and Kazakhstan, in search of better economic opportunities. This has led to a significant diaspora community, with many Kyrgyz people living and working abroad. Within the country, there is also a significant movement of people from rural areas to urban centers, in search of better job opportunities and living conditions.\n\nOverall, Kyrgyzstan's population is characterized by a diverse mix of ethnic groups, languages, and religions, with a relatively young and urbanizing population. The country's population trends have significant implications for its economic and social development, and will likely continue to shape the country's future in the years to come.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Kyrgyz | 73.5% | Nationwide | Dominant ethnic group |\n| Uzbek | 14.5% | South | Significant minority group |\n| Russian | 5.5% | North | Legacy of Soviet era |\n| Tajik | 1.5% | East | Minority group in eastern regions |\n| Kazakh | 1.2% | North | Minority group in northern regions |\n| Uyghur | 0.9% | South | Minority group in southern regions |\n| Dungan | 0.5% | South | Minority group in southern regions |\n[/TABLE]\nKyrgyzstan is a multi-ethnic country, with a diverse mix of ethnic groups that have lived together for centuries.
