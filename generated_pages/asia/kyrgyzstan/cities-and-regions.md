[SECTION] How Kyrgyzstan Is Divided [/SECTION]
Kyrgyzstan is divided into seven provinces, also known as oblasts, and the capital city of Bishkek. Each province has its own administrative center and is further divided into districts. The provinces are Batken, Chuy, Jalal-Abad, Naryn, Osh, Talas, and Issyk-Kul. This administrative structure allows for a relatively decentralized system of governance, with each province having a degree of autonomy in managing its local affairs.

The country's geography also plays a significant role in its administrative divisions, with the Tian Shan mountain range dividing the country into two main regions: the north and the south. The northern region is home to the capital city of Bishkek and is generally more urbanized, while the southern region is more rural and mountainous. This division has significant implications for the country's economy, culture, and transportation infrastructure.
