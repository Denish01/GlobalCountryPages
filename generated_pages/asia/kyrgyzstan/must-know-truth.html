        <p>Kyrgyzstan, a <strong>sovereign</strong> country located in <strong>Asia</strong>, has a rich and diverse history. The region was first inhabited by nomadic tribes, with the earliest recorded history dating back to the 3rd century BCE. The territory was later influenced by various empires, including the <strong>Mongol Empire</strong> in the 13th century. In the 19th century, Kyrgyzstan was annexed by the <strong>Russian Empire</strong>, and it became a part of the <strong>Soviet Union</strong> in 1924.
