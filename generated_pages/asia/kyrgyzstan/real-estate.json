The market has experienced significant growth in recent years, with prices increasing by up to 15% annually. However, the market is still relatively small and underdeveloped, with limited financing options available to buyers. The urban areas tend to have more modern and well-maintained properties, while rural areas often have more traditional and older homes. The price trajectory is expected to continue its upward trend, driven by the country's growing economy and increasing demand for housing.\n\nThe current market conditions are characterized by a shortage of high-quality properties, particularly in the luxury segment. This has led to an increase in prices for these types of properties, making them less affordable for many locals. However, there are still opportunities for buyers to find affordable properties, particularly in the lower-end segment. The government has implemented various initiatives to stimulate the property market, including the introduction of new mortgage products and the development of new infrastructure projects.\n\nThe market trends in Kyrgyzstan are influenced by the country's strategic location, with its proximity to China and other Central Asian countries. This has led to an increase in foreign investment in the country, particularly in the property sector. The government has also introduced various incentives to attract foreign investors, including tax breaks and other benefits. Overall, the property market in Kyrgyzstan offers a range of opportunities for buyers and investors, from affordable housing to luxury properties and commercial developments.\n\n[SECTION] Prices by Area [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area/City | Buy (per sqm, USD) | Rent (monthly, USD) | Type |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Bishkek | 250-500 | 100-300 | Apartment |\n| Karakol | 150-300 | 50-150 | House |\n| Osh | 100-250 | 30-100 | Apartment |\n| Jalal-Abad | 80-200 | 20-50 | House |\n| Naryn | 60-150 | 15-30 | Apartment |\n| Tokmak | 50-120 | 10-20 | House |\n| Issyk-Kul | 40-100 | 8-15 | Apartment |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Ownership Rules [/SECTION]\n- Foreigners can buy property in Kyrgyzstan, but they must register with the relevant authorities and obtain a **residence permit**.\n- Foreigners can own property for a maximum of 50 years, after which it must be transferred to a Kyrgyz citizen or a company registered in Kyrgyzstan.\n- Foreigners can also lease property for a maximum of 50 years, with the option to renew the lease.\n- Foreigners must obtain a **permit from the State Committee for Architecture and Construction** to buy or lease property.\n- Foreigners can also set up a **company in Kyrgyzstan** to buy or lease property, which can provide more flexibility and benefits.\n\n[SECTION] Buying Process [/SECTION]\n1.
