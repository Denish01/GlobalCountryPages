[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Palestine has a relatively underdeveloped public transportation system, with most people relying on **taxis**, **minibuses**, and **private cars** to get around. The quality of public transit varies between cities, with Ramallah and Gaza City having more comprehensive networks than smaller towns. However, the lack of a unified transportation system and limited infrastructure make it challenging to navigate the territory. Many Palestinians also rely on **walking** and **cycling** for short distances, particularly in urban areas.

The main transportation modes in Palestine include **buses**, **taxis**, and **minibuses**, which operate on fixed routes and are relatively affordable. However, the availability and frequency of these services can be limited, especially in rural areas. Additionally, the **Israeli occupation** and **security restrictions** can impact the movement of people and goods, leading to **traffic congestion** and **delays**. As a result, many Palestinians opt for private transportation or rely on **informal** transportation services, such as **shared taxis** and **private minibus operators**.
