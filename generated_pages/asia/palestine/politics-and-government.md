[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The Palestinian political system is based on the **Palestinian Basic Law**, which was adopted in 2003 and outlines the powers and structure of the government. The system is semi-presidential, with a **President** serving as head of state and a **Prime Minister** as head of government. The President is directly elected by the people for a four-year term, while the Prime Minister is appointed by the President and approved by the **Palestinian Legislative Council**. The Palestinian Legislative Council is a unicameral body with 132 seats, with members elected by proportional representation for a four-year term. The government is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial, with a system of checks and balances to ensure separation of powers.

The Palestinian government faces significant challenges, including the **Israeli occupation**, which limits its authority and control over territory. The government also faces divisions between the **Fatah** and **Hamas** parties, which have resulted in a split between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Despite these challenges, the government has made efforts to establish a functioning administration and provide services to the population.

The Palestinian political system is also influenced by international organizations and donors, which provide significant financial and technical support to the government. The **United Nations** and the **European Union** are among the key international partners, and the government has also received support from **Arab** and **Islamic** countries.
