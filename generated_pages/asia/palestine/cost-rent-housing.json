Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, with a security deposit of one to two months' rent required. Tenant rights are generally protected under Palestinian law, but the enforcement of these rights can be inconsistent. Compared to regional neighbors, Palestine's housing costs are relatively **affordable**, with prices lower than in Israel but higher than in some parts of Jordan and Egypt.\n\nThe housing market in Palestine is also influenced by the **political and economic situation**, with fluctuations in the exchange rate and inflation affecting the affordability of housing. Additionally, the **limited availability of housing finance** options can make it difficult for Palestinians to purchase homes, leading to a reliance on rental housing. Despite these challenges, the Palestinian government has implemented initiatives to increase access to affordable housing, including the development of new housing projects and the provision of subsidies for low-income families.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $250-$400 | $150-$300 | basic amenities, shared facilities |\n| 1 Bedroom | $350-$550 | $200-$400 | furnished, private bathroom |\n| 2 Bedroom | $500-$800 | $300-$600 | family-sized, amenities like parking and gym |\n| 3 Bedroom | $700-$1,200 | $400-$900 | spacious, high-end finishes, security |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $1,500-$3,000 | prime locations, commercial areas |\n| Suburbs | $1,000-$2,000 | residential areas, amenities like schools and shops |\n| Rural | $500-$1,500 | agricultural areas, limited amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- Al-Tireh, Ramallah: $300-$600 per month, a quiet, residential area with easy access to the city center\n- Al-Bireh, Ramallah: $400-$800 per month, a bustling neighborhood with shops, restaurants, and entertainment options\n- Gaza City Center: $200-$400 per month, a vibrant, urban area with a mix of old and new buildings\n- Hebron Old City: $150-$300 per month, a historic, cultural area with narrow streets and traditional architecture\n- Beit Hanina, Ramallah: $250-$500 per month, a suburban area with a mix of Palestinian and international residents\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Palestine [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods thoroughly, considering factors like safety, amenities, and commute time\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent or property manager to find a suitable apartment\n- Be prepared to negotiate rent and amenities, as prices can be flexible\n- Check the condition of the property carefully, including any needed repairs or maintenance\n- Utilities like electricity, water, and internet are usually not included in the rent, so factor these costs into your budget\n- Furnished apartments are common, but unfurnished options are also available, often at a lower rent",
