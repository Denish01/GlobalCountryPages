  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Palestine varies greatly between public and private facilities, with an average health expenditure per capita of $346, and out-of-pocket expenses accounting for 42.1% of total healthcare spending.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $346\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 42.1%\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 101\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: ILS\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe Palestinian healthcare system is a mixed model, consisting of both public and private providers. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality, with limited resources and outdated equipment, whereas private facilities offer higher quality care, but at a significantly higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only affordable option, while foreigners and those with higher incomes tend to opt for private care. It is recommended to have health insurance in Palestine, as the cost of medical care can be prohibitively expensive, especially in private facilities.\n\nThe healthcare system in Palestine faces several challenges, including a shortage of medical staff, limited access to specialized care, and a lack of modern medical equipment. Additionally, the ongoing conflict with Israel has led to a decline in the overall quality of healthcare services, particularly in the public sector. As a result, many Palestinians seek medical care in neighboring countries, such as Jordan or Egypt, or in private facilities within Palestine. Despite these challenges, there are still many qualified medical professionals in Palestine, and some private facilities offer high-quality care.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | Prices vary by location and doctor's expertise |\n| Specialist Consultation | $20-$50 | $100-$200 | Prices vary by specialty and doctor's reputation |\n| Dental Checkup | $15-$30 | $50-$100 | Prices vary by location and dentist's expertise |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$25 | $30-$75 | Prices vary by location and optometrist's expertise |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Prices vary by laboratory and test complexity |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$200 | Prices vary by hospital and severity of condition |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $100-$500 | Prices vary by hospital and level of care |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$2,000 | Prices vary by procedure and surgeon's expertise |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,000-$3,000 | Prices vary by hospital and level of care |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | Prices vary by facility and scan complexity |\n| X-Ray | $20-$100 | Prices vary by facility and type of X-ray |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Covers basic medical services, including doctor visits and hospital stays |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-$300 | Covers a wide range of medical services, including specialist consultations and surgical procedures |\n| International / Expat | $200-$500 | Covers medical services worldwide, including evacuation and repatriation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Common medications, such as antibiotics and painkillers, are widely available in Palestine and can cost between $5-$20 per prescription.\n- Prescription medications, such as those for chronic conditions, can cost between $20-$50 per month.\n- Pharmacy availability varies by location, with more options available in larger cities like Ramallah and Gaza City.\n- Over-the-counter medications, such as cold and flu remedies, can cost between $5-$15 per package.\n- Some medications, such as those for serious conditions like cancer or HIV, may be difficult to find or expensive, and may require a special prescription or importation from another country.\n- Pharmacies in Palestine often accept cash and some credit cards, but may not accept insurance, so it's essential to check with your insurance provider before filling a prescription.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it's essential to seek help immediately. The emergency number in Palestine is 101, and ambulance services are available, although they may be limited in some areas. For foreigners, it's recommended to seek care at a private hospital, such as the Augusta Victoria Hospital in Jerusalem or the Al-Ahli Hospital in Hebron, which offer high-quality care and may have English-speaking staff. In a medical emergency, it's crucial to stay calm and provide as much information as possible to emergency responders, including your location, condition, and any relevant medical history. Additionally, it's a good idea to have a basic knowledge of Arabic phrases, such as \"I need a doctor\" (ana mahsool doktor), to help communicate with emergency responders.",
