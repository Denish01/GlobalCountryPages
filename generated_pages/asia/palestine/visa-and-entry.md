# Palestine Visa & Entry Requirements

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Palestine before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
The visa policy of Palestine is considered moderate, with some countries enjoying visa-free access, while others require a visa on arrival or prior to arrival. Citizens of around 40 countries, including many in the Middle East and North Africa, can enter Palestine visa-free for a limited period. However, the Palestinian Authority has limited control over its borders, and entry requirements can vary depending on the point of entry and the individual's nationality. The Israeli government, which controls many of the borders and checkpoints, may also impose its own visa requirements and restrictions.

The Palestinian Authority has been working to develop its own visa policy and entry requirements, but the process is complex and subject to change. Visitors to Palestine should be aware of the current requirements and regulations, as well as any restrictions or limitations that may apply to their travel. It is essential to research and understand the specific requirements for your nationality and purpose of visit before planning a trip to Palestine.
