        <h2>Economic Overview</h2>
        <p>The economy of Palestine is classified as a lower-middle-income economy, with a nominal GDP of approximately $14 billion. The country's economic development level is hindered by its disputed status and the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which has resulted in significant restrictions on the movement of people and goods. Despite these challenges, the Palestinian economy has shown resilience and adaptability, with a growing services sector and a significant increase in foreign aid and investment.</p>
        <p>The Palestinian economy is largely driven by the services sector, which accounts for approximately 80% of the country's GDP. The services sector includes industries such as finance, trade, and tourism, which are primarily concentrated in the West Bank. The country's economic trajectory is heavily influenced by its relationship with Israel, with which it has a complex and often contentious trade relationship. The Palestinian economy is also heavily reliant on foreign aid, with significant contributions from countries such as the United States, the European Union, and Arab states.</p>
        <p>The Palestinian government has implemented various economic development strategies aimed at promoting private sector growth, improving the business environment, and increasing foreign investment. These efforts have included initiatives such as the establishment of a new investment promotion agency, the creation of special economic zones, and the implementation of policies aimed at improving the ease of doing business. Despite these efforts, the Palestinian economy continues to face significant challenges, including high unemployment rates, limited access to natural resources, and significant restrictions on the movement of people and goods.</p>

        <h2>Economic Outlook</h2>
        <p>The Palestinian economy is expected to continue growing, albeit at a slow pace, driven by the services sector and a growing IT industry. The country's economic outlook is heavily influenced by its relationship with Israel, with which it has a complex and often contentious trade relationship. The Palestinian government has implemented various economic development strategies aimed at promoting private sector growth, improving the business environment, and increasing foreign investment. These efforts have included initiatives such as the establishment of a new investment promotion agency, the creation of special economic zones, and the implementation of policies aimed at improving the ease of doing business.</p>
        <p>The Palestinian government has also prioritized the development of several major projects, including the construction of a new airport in the West Bank and the establishment of a new industrial zone in the Gaza Strip. Additionally, the country has seen a significant increase in foreign investment, particularly in the IT and tourism sectors. Despite these positive developments, the Palestinian economy continues to face significant challenges, including high unemployment rates, limited access to natural resources, and significant restrictions on the movement of people and goods. As such, the country's economic outlook remains uncertain, and will likely be shaped by the outcome of ongoing negotiations with Israel and the international community.</p>
