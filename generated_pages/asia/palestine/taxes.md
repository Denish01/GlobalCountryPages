[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Palestine has a **territorial tax system**, which means that individuals and businesses are taxed on their income earned within the country, regardless of their residency status. However, residents are also subject to tax on their worldwide income, with credits available for taxes paid in other countries. To be considered a resident for tax purposes, an individual must have a **permanent home** in Palestine and spend at least 183 days in the country during the tax year.

The tax system in Palestine is administered by the **Palestinian Ministry of Finance**, which is responsible for collecting taxes, enforcing tax laws, and providing guidance to taxpayers. The ministry also has the authority to negotiate **double taxation treaties** with other countries to avoid taxing the same income twice. Currently, Palestine has tax treaties with several countries, including Egypt, Jordan, and the United Arab Emirates.
