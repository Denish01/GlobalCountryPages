The quality of public transit varies between cities, with Ramallah and Gaza City having more comprehensive networks than smaller towns. However, the lack of a unified transportation system and limited infrastructure make it challenging to navigate the territory. Many Palestinians also rely on **walking** and **cycling** for short distances, particularly in urban areas.\n\nThe main transportation modes in Palestine include **buses**, **taxis**, and **minibuses**, which operate on fixed routes and are relatively affordable. However, the availability and frequency of these services can be limited, especially in rural areas. Additionally, the **Israeli occupation** and **security restrictions** can impact the movement of people and goods, leading to **traffic congestion** and **delays**. As a result, many Palestinians opt for private transportation or rely on **informal** transportation services, such as **shared taxis** and **private minibus operators**.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.50-$1.00 | $15-$25 | Limited coverage, frequent delays |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $1.00-$2.00 | N/A | Fixed routes, frequent departures |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $2.50 | $1.00 | $5-$10 | Available in major cities |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $2.00 | $0.50 | $5-$10 | Careem, Uber available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-$30 | To Ramallah city center |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.50 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.20 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$60 | Economy car, including insurance |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $2-$5 | Limited parking options available |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $5-$10 | Limited toll roads, mostly near borders |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$20 | Limited frequency, variable quality |\n| Domestic Flight | N/A | Not available |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Use **ride-hailing apps** like Careem or Uber for convenient and relatively affordable transportation.\n- **Negotiate taxi fares** before starting your journey, especially for longer trips.\n- Consider **carpooling** or **sharing taxis** to reduce costs and environmental impact.\n- Be aware of **traffic restrictions** and **security checkpoints**, which can cause delays and disruptions.\n- Use **cash** for most transactions, as credit card facilities may be limited.\n- Download **transportation apps**, such as Moovit or Waze, to help navigate the territory's transportation network.",
