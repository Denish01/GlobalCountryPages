[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Palestine is divided into public and private sectors, with the public sector being the largest. Public schools are generally considered to be of lower quality compared to private schools, with limited resources and large class sizes. The language of instruction in public schools is Arabic, while private schools may offer instruction in English or other languages. Compulsory education in Palestine lasts for 12 years, from age 6 to 18. International schools are also available in larger cities such as Ramallah and Jerusalem, offering a range of curricula including the International Baccalaureate and British A-levels.

The quality of education in Palestine can vary significantly depending on the type of institution and the location. Public schools in urban areas tend to be better funded and staffed than those in rural areas, while private schools often have more resources and better facilities. Despite these challenges, Palestine has made significant progress in improving its education system in recent years, with a literacy rate of over 96%. However, the education system still faces many challenges, including a shortage of qualified teachers and limited access to technology and other resources.
