# Palestine Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

The infrastructure in Palestine is characterized by significant development gaps and challenges, particularly in the areas of transportation, energy, and water, due to the disputed territory's complex geopolitical situation and limited resources. 

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 99% of population
Internet Penetration: 60%
Road Network: 4,800 km, mixed quality with paved and unpaved roads
Rail Network: none
Major Airports: 2
Major Ports: 1, the port of Gaza, with limited access due to the Israeli blockade
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
The infrastructure in Palestine is underdeveloped and faces numerous challenges, including limited access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation, particularly in rural and marginalized areas. Recent investments have focused on upgrading existing infrastructure, including road networks and energy generation, but much work remains to be done to address the significant gaps in infrastructure development. The urban-rural gap in infrastructure development is also a significant concern, with urban areas such as Ramallah and Gaza City generally having better access to basic services than rural areas.

Despite these challenges, there are ongoing efforts to improve the infrastructure in Palestine, including investments in renewable energy and upgrades to the road network. However, the complex geopolitical situation and limited resources available to the Palestinian authorities pose significant obstacles to infrastructure development. The Israeli occupation and blockade of the Gaza Strip have also severely impacted the infrastructure in Palestine, particularly in the areas of energy, water, and transportation.

The Palestinian authorities have developed strategies to address the infrastructure gaps, including public-private partnerships and international cooperation. However, the pace of progress is slow, and much work remains to be done to address the significant infrastructure challenges facing Palestine. The development of infrastructure is critical to supporting economic growth, improving living standards, and enhancing the overall quality of life for the Palestinian people.
