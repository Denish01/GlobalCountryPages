However, the high inflation rate of 53.7% can make it challenging for foreigners to navigate the local economy. A budget of $600-$800 per month can provide a basic lifestyle, with shared accommodation and cooking most meals at home. A mid-range lifestyle, with a one-bedroom apartment in the city center and a mix of cooking and eating out, would require a budget of $1,200-$1,800 per month. A comfortable lifestyle, with a nice two-bedroom apartment and frequent dining out, would cost around $2,500-$3,500 per month.\n\nIn comparison to neighboring countries, Palestine is more affordable than Israel but more expensive than Jordan and Egypt. The cost of living in Palestine is also affected by the ongoing economic restrictions and trade barriers, which can limit the availability and affordability of certain goods and services. Overall, Palestine can be a relatively affordable destination for foreigners, especially those who are willing to adopt a local lifestyle and cook most of their meals at home.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Breakdown [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Category | Budget ($) | Mid-Range ($) | Comfortable ($) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rent (1BR apartment) | 200-300 | 400-600 | 800-1,200 | (budget=shared/outside, mid=1BR center, comfortable=nice 2BR) |\n| Food & Groceries | 150-250 | 300-500 | 600-1,000 | (budget=cook mostly, mid=mix, comfortable=eat out often) |\n| Transportation | 50-100 | 100-200 | 200-300 | (budget=public only, mid=mix, comfortable=taxi/car) |\n| Utilities & Internet | 100-150 | 150-250 | 250-350 | (electricity, water, internet, phone) |\n| Healthcare / Insurance | 50-100 | 100-200 | 200-300 | (budget=public only, comfortable=private) |\n| Entertainment & Social | 100-200 | 200-400 | 400-600 | (going out, hobbies, gym) |\n| Clothing & Personal | 50-100 | 100-200 | 200-300 | |\n| Savings / Misc | 100-200 | 200-400 | 400-600 | |\n| **Total** | **600-800** | **1,200-1,800** | **2,500-3,500** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Budget Tier Lifestyles [/SECTION]\nAt the budget level, daily life in Palestine would be quite basic.
