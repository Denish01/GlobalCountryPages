[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
The population of Palestine has been steadily increasing, with a growth rate of 2.4% per annum. This growth is largely driven by a high fertility rate of 3.8 children per woman, which is one of the highest in the region. The total population of 5.4 million is distributed across the West Bank and Gaza Strip, with the majority residing in urban areas. The urban population accounts for approximately 75% of the total population, with many Palestinians living in cities such as Ramallah, Hebron, and Gaza City.

The population of Palestine is also characterized by a relatively young age structure, with a median age of 20 years. This has significant implications for the country's economy and social services, as a large proportion of the population is in the working-age group. However, the high population growth rate and density also pose significant challenges, including strain on resources, infrastructure, and the environment.

In terms of migration patterns, Palestine has experienced significant displacement and migration of its population, particularly during the 1948 and 1967 wars. Many Palestinians were forced to flee their homes and seek refuge in neighboring countries, resulting in a large diaspora community. Today, there are approximately 7 million Palestinians living outside of Palestine, with many still holding refugee status.
