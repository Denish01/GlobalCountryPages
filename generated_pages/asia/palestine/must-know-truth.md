# The Truth About Palestine - History & Real Facts

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
The history of Palestine is complex and multifaceted, with various empires and dynasties vying for control over the region. The **Ottoman Empire** ruled Palestine from 1517 to 1917, followed by the **British Empire**, which took control of the territory through a **League of Nations mandate** in 1920. During this period, the Jewish population in Palestine, which was then a small minority, began to grow due to immigration from Europe. The **United Nations** proposed a plan to divide Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states in 1947, but this plan was never fully implemented. The **State of Israel** was declared in 1948, leading to the **Arab-Israeli War** and the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, known as the **Nakba** or "catastrophe" in Arabic.

The following decades saw a series of conflicts and negotiations, including the **Six-Day War** in 1967, in which Israel occupied the **West Bank** and **Gaza Strip**, and the **Oslo Accords** in 1993, which established the **Palestinian Interim Self-Government**. The **Palestinian National Authority** was established in 1994, with **Yasser Arafat** as its first president. Since then, there have been ongoing efforts to establish a **two-state solution**, with Palestine and Israel existing as separate, sovereign states.

Palestine has been recognized as a **non-member observer state** by the United Nations since 2012. The **International Criminal Court** has also recognized Palestine as a **state** for the purposes of its jurisdiction. However, the status of Palestine remains **disputed**, with some countries recognizing it as a sovereign state and others not.

The **geography** of Palestine is characterized by a mix of mountains, hills, and coastal plains. The **West Bank** is a landlocked territory, while the **Gaza Strip** is a coastal region bordering the Mediterranean Sea. The **Jordan River** forms the eastern border of the West Bank, while the **Mediterranean Sea** forms the western border of the Gaza Strip.
