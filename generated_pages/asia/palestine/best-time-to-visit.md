[CALLOUT] Best months to visit Palestine: March to May and September to November. Peak season: June to August. Budget season: December to February. Avoid: July and August due to the hot summer weather and crowds of tourists, and September to November if you're looking for a quiet and peaceful experience, as these months coincide with the peak tourist season and various festivals and events.

[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Palestine has a Mediterranean climate, characterized by hot and dry summers, and mild and wet winters. The country can be divided into three main climate zones: the coastal region, which has a moderate climate with average temperatures ranging from 12°C to 25°C; the mountainous region, which has a cooler climate with average temperatures ranging from 10°C to 20°C; and the Jordan Valley, which has a hot and dry climate with average temperatures ranging from 15°C to 30°C. The dry season, which runs from May to October, is the best time to visit Palestine, as the weather is warm and sunny, with minimal rainfall. The wet season, which runs from November to April, is characterized by significant rainfall, which can make traveling and outdoor activities more challenging.

The seasons in Palestine have a significant impact on travel, as the country's infrastructure and tourist facilities are designed to accommodate the peak tourist season, which coincides with the summer months. During this time, popular tourist destinations such as Jerusalem, Bethlehem, and Hebron are crowded, and prices for accommodations and tourist services are at their highest. In contrast, the shoulder season, which runs from March to May and September to November, offers a more relaxed and peaceful experience, with fewer tourists and lower prices.

The winter months, which run from December to February, are the coolest and wettest time of the year, with average temperatures ranging from 10°C to 15°C. While the weather may not be ideal for outdoor activities, the winter months are a great time to visit Palestine's museums, historical sites, and cultural attractions, which are less crowded and offer a more intimate experience.
