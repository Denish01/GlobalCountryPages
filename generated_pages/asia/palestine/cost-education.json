Public schools are generally considered to be of lower quality compared to private schools, with limited resources and large class sizes. The language of instruction in public schools is Arabic, while private schools may offer instruction in English or other languages. Compulsory education in Palestine lasts for 12 years, from age 6 to 18. International schools are also available in larger cities such as Ramallah and Jerusalem, offering a range of curricula including the International Baccalaureate and British A-levels.\n\nThe quality of education in Palestine can vary significantly depending on the type of institution and the location. Public schools in urban areas tend to be better funded and staffed than those in rural areas, while private schools often have more resources and better facilities. Despite these challenges, Palestine has made significant progress in improving its education system in recent years, with a literacy rate of over 96%. However, the education system still faces many challenges, including a shortage of qualified teachers and limited access to technology and other resources.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 (free) | Limited resources and large class sizes |\n| Private Primary | $500-$1,500 | Range of quality and resources depending on tier |\n| Public Secondary | $0 (free) | Limited resources and large class sizes |\n| Private Secondary | $1,000-$3,000 | Range of quality and resources depending on tier |\n| International School | $5,000-$10,000 | Offers range of curricula including IB and A-levels |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $1,000-$2,000 | $2,000-$3,000 | Limited programs and resources |\n| Private University | $2,000-$4,000 | $3,000-$5,000 | Range of programs and resources depending on tier |\n| Top-Ranked University | $3,000-$5,000 | $4,000-$6,000 | Al-Quds University, one of the top-ranked universities in Palestine |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $100-$300 | Limited availability and high demand |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $20-$50 | Range of quality and expertise depending on tutor |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $100-$300 | Offers range of languages including English and Arabic |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $50-$100 | Basic supplies including textbooks and stationery |\n| School Uniform | $20-$50 | Required for most schools, cost varies depending on quality and supplier |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The best schools for expats in Palestine are often international schools, which offer a range of curricula and have experienced teachers.\n- Scholarship availability is limited in Palestine, but some universities and organizations offer scholarships to students who demonstrate financial need or academic excellence.\n- Online learning options are becoming increasingly popular in Palestine, with many universities and institutions offering online courses and programs.\n- Education quality in Palestine is generally considered to be lower than in other countries in the region, due to limited resources and infrastructure.\n- The **Ministry of Education and Higher Education** is responsible for overseeing the education system in Palestine, and provides information and resources for students and parents.\n- Expats and international students should research thoroughly and plan carefully before selecting a school or university in Palestine, as the quality and availability of education can vary significantly depending on the institution and location.",
