The system is semi-presidential, with a **President** serving as head of state and a **Prime Minister** as head of government. The President is directly elected by the people for a four-year term, while the Prime Minister is appointed by the President and approved by the **Palestinian Legislative Council**. The Palestinian Legislative Council is a unicameral body with 132 seats, with members elected by proportional representation for a four-year term. The government is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial, with a system of checks and balances to ensure separation of powers.\n\nThe Palestinian government faces significant challenges, including the **Israeli occupation**, which limits its authority and control over territory. The government also faces divisions between the **Fatah** and **Hamas** parties, which have resulted in a split between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Despite these challenges, the government has made efforts to establish a functioning administration and provide services to the population.\n\nThe Palestinian political system is also influenced by international organizations and donors, which provide significant financial and technical support to the government. The **United Nations** and the **European Union** are among the key international partners, and the government has also received support from **Arab** and **Islamic** countries.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | Presidency | President Mahmoud Abbas | Head of state, commander-in-chief |\n| Executive | Prime Minister's Office | Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh | Head of government, oversees ministries |\n| Legislative | Palestinian Legislative Council | Speaker Aziz Dweik | Lawmaking, oversight of government |\n| Judicial | Supreme Judicial Council | Chief Justice Issa Abu Sharar | Interpretation of laws, judicial oversight |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Major Political Parties [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Party | Position | Leader | Seats | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fatah | Centrist, nationalist | President Mahmoud Abbas | 45 | Dominant party in the West Bank |\n| Hamas | Islamist, nationalist | Ismail Haniyeh | 74 | Dominant party in the Gaza Strip |\n| Palestinian People's Party | Leftist, nationalist | Bassam Salhi | 3 | Secular party with a small presence |\n| Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine | Leftist, nationalist | George Habash | 3 | Marxist-Leninist party with a small presence |\n| Islamic Jihad Movement | Islamist, nationalist | Ramadan Abdullah Shallah | 0 | Militant group with a small presence |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Elections [/SECTION]\n- The last **presidential election** was held in 2005, with President Mahmoud Abbas winning a four-year term.\n- The last **legislative election** was held in 2006, with Hamas winning a majority of seats in the Palestinian Legislative Council.\n- The **electoral system** is based on proportional representation, with voters electing members to the Palestinian Legislative Council.\n- The **next election** is scheduled to be held in 2023, but the date has been repeatedly postponed due to divisions between Fatah and Hamas.\n\n[SECTION] Political Stability & Challenges [/SECTION]\n- The **Israeli occupation** remains a major challenge to Palestinian stability, with Israel maintaining control over borders, security, and natural resources.\n- The **division between Fatah and Hamas** has resulted in a split between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with each party controlling a separate territory.\n- The **economic situation** is precarious, with high unemployment and poverty rates, and a significant dependence on international aid.\n- The **humanitarian situation** is also a concern, with limited access to basic services such as healthcare, education, and water.\n- The **peace process** with Israel remains stalled, with little progress on key issues such as borders, settlements, and Jerusalem.\n- The **regional dynamics** are also a challenge, with the **Arab-Israeli conflict** and the **Iranian-Saudi rivalry** having an impact on Palestinian stability.\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Relations [/SECTION]\n- Palestine has **diplomatic relations** with over 130 countries, including many Arab and Islamic countries.\n- Palestine is a **member of the United Nations**, with observer state status, and participates in several UN agencies.\n- Palestine is also a **member of the Arab League** and the **Organization of Islamic Cooperation**.\n- The **European Union** is a key partner, providing significant financial and technical support to the Palestinian government.\n- The **United States** has historically been a key ally, but relations have been strained in recent years due to disagreements over the peace process and Israeli settlements.",
