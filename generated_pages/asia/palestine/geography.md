Palestine is located in the Middle East, in the continent of Asia. It is situated on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea and is bordered by several countries, including Israel to the north, east, and south, Egypt to the southwest, and Jordan to the east. The country is divided into two main territories: the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, which are separated by Israeli territory. The West Bank is bordered by Israel to the north, east, and south, and by Jordan to the east, while the Gaza Strip is bordered by Israel to the north and east, and by Egypt to the southwest.

The country's strategic location has made it an important crossroads for trade and cultural exchange throughout history. The Mediterranean Sea to the west provides a significant coastline, while the Jordan River to the east forms a natural border with Jordan. The terrain is varied, with mountains, valleys, and coastal plains, making it a unique and diverse region. The country's geography has also been shaped by its complex history, with many historical sites and landmarks, such as the ancient city of Jericho, which is considered one of the oldest continuously occupied cities in the world.

The Jordan Valley, which runs along the eastern border of the West Bank, is a fertile and densely populated region, with many agricultural communities and historical sites.

The Gaza Strip, on the other hand, is a coastal plain, with a flat and sandy terrain. The strip is bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the west and by Israel to the north and east. The coastline is approximately 40 km long and is an important source of livelihood for many Palestinians, with fishing and tourism being significant industries. The terrain is also home to several natural springs and wells, which provide fresh water to the local population. In addition to the mountains and coastal plains, Palestine is also home to several deserts, including the Judean Desert, which is located in the southeastern part of the West Bank.
