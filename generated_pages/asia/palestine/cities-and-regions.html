        <h2>How Palestine Is Divided</h2>
        <p>Palestine is divided into 16 governorates, which are the primary administrative divisions of the territory. These governorates are further divided into municipalities, villages, and refugee camps. The governorates are responsible for providing various public services, including education, healthcare, and infrastructure development. The administrative structure of Palestine is complex, with some areas under the control of the Palestinian National Authority and others under Israeli occupation.</p>
        <p>The division of Palestine is also influenced by the Oslo Accords, which established the Palestinian Interim Self-Government Authority and divided the territory into three areas: Area A, Area B, and Area C. Area A is under Palestinian control, Area B is under Palestinian civil control and Israeli military control, and Area C is under Israeli control. This division has significant implications for the daily lives of Palestinians, including access to resources, movement, and economic opportunities.</p>
