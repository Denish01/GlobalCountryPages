[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Palestine is relatively **competitive**, with a high demand for housing, particularly in urban areas such as Ramallah and Gaza City. Typical lease terms range from 6 to 12 months, with a security deposit of one to two months' rent required. Tenant rights are generally protected under Palestinian law, but the enforcement of these rights can be inconsistent. Compared to regional neighbors, Palestine's housing costs are relatively **affordable**, with prices lower than in Israel but higher than in some parts of Jordan and Egypt.

The housing market in Palestine is also influenced by the **political and economic situation**, with fluctuations in the exchange rate and inflation affecting the affordability of housing. Additionally, the **limited availability of housing finance** options can make it difficult for Palestinians to purchase homes, leading to a reliance on rental housing. Despite these challenges, the Palestinian government has implemented initiatives to increase access to affordable housing, including the development of new housing projects and the provision of subsidies for low-income families.
