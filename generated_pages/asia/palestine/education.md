[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Palestine is divided into three main stages: **primary**, **secondary**, and **tertiary education**. Primary education, which is compulsory for all children between the ages of 6 and 11, focuses on basic subjects such as Arabic, mathematics, science, and social studies. Secondary education, which is also compulsory, is divided into two stages: lower secondary (ages 12-14) and upper secondary (ages 15-17). Students in upper secondary education can choose to pursue either a **scientific** or **literary** track, which prepares them for university studies. Tertiary education, which includes universities and colleges, offers a range of academic programs in fields such as engineering, medicine, and the humanities.

The quality of education in Palestine is generally considered to be good, with a strong emphasis on **academic achievement** and **critical thinking**. However, the education system faces several challenges, including a lack of resources and infrastructure, particularly in rural areas. Additionally, the **Israeli occupation** has had a significant impact on the education system, with many schools and universities facing restrictions and closures. Despite these challenges, the Palestinian education system has made significant progress in recent years, with a growing number of students pursuing higher education and a increasing number of universities and colleges offering high-quality academic programs.

Public education is the primary source of education for most Palestinian students, with the majority of schools and universities being government-funded. However, there are also a number of private schools and universities that offer alternative educational options for students who can afford them. The **Ministry of Education and Higher Education** is responsible for overseeing the education system and implementing policies and reforms to improve the quality of education.
