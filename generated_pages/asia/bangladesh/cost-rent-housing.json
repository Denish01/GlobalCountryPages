The rental market is largely unregulated, with typical lease terms ranging from 6-12 months. Deposits are usually required, equivalent to 1-2 months' rent, and tenants have limited rights. Compared to regional neighbors such as India and Myanmar, Bangladesh's housing costs are relatively affordable. However, the market is subject to fluctuations in the economy and inflation, which can impact rent prices. The current inflation rate of 10.5% can affect the cost of living, including housing, and it is essential to consider this when planning to rent or buy a property.\n\nThe housing market in Bangladesh is also influenced by the country's rapid urbanization, with many people moving to cities such as Dhaka in search of employment opportunities. This has led to a shortage of affordable housing, particularly in the city center, and a rise in prices for properties in desirable areas. Despite these challenges, Bangladesh's housing market offers a range of options for renters and buyers, from modern apartments to traditional houses, and from affordable to luxury properties.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $150-$300 | $100-$200 | Basic amenities, shared facilities |\n| 1 Bedroom | $250-$400 | $150-$300 | Furnished, modern appliances, security |\n| 2 Bedroom | $400-$600 | $250-$450 | Spacious, family-friendly, amenities |\n| 3 Bedroom | $600-$1,000 | $400-$700 | Luxury, high-end finishes, prime location |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $1,500-$3,000 | Prime locations, modern amenities |\n| Suburbs | $1,000-$2,000 | Residential areas, family-friendly |\n| Rural | $500-$1,000 | Agricultural land, limited amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Gulshan**: A popular expat neighborhood with modern amenities, security, and a range of restaurants and shopping centers, with typical rent ranges from $500-$1,000 USD per month.\n- **Banani**: A upscale neighborhood with luxury apartments, high-end shopping, and fine dining options, with typical rent ranges from $800-$1,500 USD per month.\n- **Dhanmondi**: A family-friendly neighborhood with a range of apartments, parks, and educational institutions, with typical rent ranges from $300-$600 USD per month.\n- **Mohakhali**: A commercial neighborhood with a mix of office spaces, restaurants, and residential areas, with typical rent ranges from $200-$400 USD per month.\n- **Baridhara**: A diplomatic neighborhood with a range of embassies, international schools, and luxury apartments, with typical rent ranges from $1,000-$2,000 USD per month.\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Bangladesh [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods thoroughly to find the best fit for your lifestyle and budget.\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent to find a property that meets your needs.\n- Inspect the property carefully before signing a lease to ensure it is in good condition.\n- Negotiate the rent and terms of the lease to get the best deal.\n- Be aware of scams and never pay a deposit without a signed lease agreement.\n- Utilities such as electricity, water, and gas are usually not included in the rent, so factor these costs into your budget.\n- Furnished apartments are common in Bangladesh, but it's essential to check the condition and quality of the furniture and appliances before signing a lease.",
