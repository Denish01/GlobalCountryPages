[/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nBangladesh has a moderate visa policy, with a mix of visa-free, visa-on-arrival, and pre-arranged visa requirements for different nationalities. Citizens of around 25 countries are eligible for visa-free access to Bangladesh, while many others can obtain a visa on arrival or through an e-visa system. The country's visa policy aims to balance the need to facilitate tourism, business, and cultural exchange with the need to maintain national security and immigration controls.\n\nThe visa policy of Bangladesh is designed to cater to different types of visitors, including tourists, business travelers, students, and workers. The country offers various types of visas, including **Tourist Visas**, **Business Visas**, **Student Visas**, and **Work Visas**, each with its own set of requirements and eligibility criteria. The visa application process typically involves submitting the required documents and fees, and waiting for the visa to be processed and approved.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | Yes | Tourist/Visa on Arrival | 30 days | Must have a valid passport and proof of onward travel |\n| UK Citizens | Yes | Tourist/Visa on Arrival | 30 days | Must have a valid passport and proof of onward travel |\n| EU Citizens | Yes | Tourist/Visa on Arrival | 30 days | Must have a valid passport and proof of onward travel |\n| Canadian Citizens | Yes | Tourist/Visa on Arrival | 30 days | Must have a valid passport and proof of onward travel |\n| Australian Citizens | Yes | Tourist/Visa on Arrival | 30 days | Must have a valid passport and proof of onward travel |\n| Indian Citizens | No | Visa-Free | 30 days | Must have a valid passport and proof of onward travel |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Tourist/Visa on Arrival | 30 days | Must have a valid passport and proof of onward travel |\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can obtain a visa on arrival at major airports in Bangladesh, which is valid for a maximum stay of 30 days.

Upon arrival, travelers must proceed to the immigration counter, where they will be required to present their travel documents and complete an arrival card. The immigration officer will then stamp the passport and issue a visa on arrival, if eligible.\n\nTravelers can expect a relatively straightforward process at immigration, but it is essential to ensure that all required documents are in order and that the visa application is complete.
