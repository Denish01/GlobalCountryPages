# Bangladesh Visa & Entry Requirements

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Bangladesh before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Bangladesh has a moderate visa policy, with a mix of visa-free, visa-on-arrival, and pre-arranged visa requirements for different nationalities. Citizens of around 25 countries are eligible for visa-free access to Bangladesh, while many others can obtain a visa on arrival or through an e-visa system. The country's visa policy aims to balance the need to facilitate tourism, business, and cultural exchange with the need to maintain national security and immigration controls.

The visa policy of Bangladesh is designed to cater to different types of visitors, including tourists, business travelers, students, and workers. The country offers various types of visas, including **Tourist Visas**, **Business Visas**, **Student Visas**, and **Work Visas**, each with its own set of requirements and eligibility criteria. The visa application process typically involves submitting the required documents and fees, and waiting for the visa to be processed and approved.

Tourists must have a valid passport, proof of onward travel, and sufficient funds to support their stay in Bangladesh.
**Business Travelers:** Business travelers require a **Business Visa**, which can be obtained through an e-visa system or at the embassy/consulate of Bangladesh. Business travelers must have an invitation letter from a Bangladeshi company, proof of business activities, and a valid passport. The requirements for business travelers are more stringent than for tourists, and the processing time for business visas can take several weeks.
**Students:** Students require a **Student Visa**, which can be obtained through an e-visa system or at the embassy/consulate of Bangladesh. Students must have proof of enrollment at a Bangladeshi educational institution, a valid passport, and sufficient funds to support their stay in Bangladesh. The student visa is typically valid for the duration of the course of study.
**Workers:** Workers require a **Work Visa**, which can be obtained through an e-visa system or at the embassy/consulate of Bangladesh. Workers must have a sponsorship letter from a Bangladeshi employer, a valid passport, and proof of qualifications and experience.

The immigration officer will then stamp the passport and issue a visa on arrival, if eligible.

Travelers can expect a relatively straightforward process at immigration, but it is essential to ensure that all required documents are in order and that the visa application is complete. Travelers should also be prepared to answer questions about their purpose of visit, length of stay, and accommodation arrangements.
