[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
The utility infrastructure in Bangladesh is still developing, with some areas experiencing frequent power outages and water shortages. The costs of utilities in Bangladesh can be unstable and fluctuate depending on the season, with higher costs during the summer months due to increased demand for electricity and water. The government has been working to improve the utility infrastructure, but the quality of services can vary greatly depending on the location.

The cost of utilities in Bangladesh is also affected by the inflation rate, which was 10.5% in 2024. This means that the prices of utilities and other goods and services are increasing, making it challenging for people to afford basic necessities. However, the government has implemented measures to subsidize the cost of utilities for low-income households, which has helped to reduce the burden of utility costs on these families.
