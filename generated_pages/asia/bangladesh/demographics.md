[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Bangladesh has one of the highest population densities in the world, with an estimated 1163 people per square kilometer. The country's population has been growing steadily over the past few decades, with an average annual growth rate of 1.0%. However, this growth rate has been declining in recent years due to a decrease in fertility rates. The population is relatively young, with a median age of 27.0 years, and the majority of the population lives in rural areas, although urbanization is increasing rapidly.

The population of Bangladesh is expected to continue growing, albeit at a slower rate, and is projected to reach 200 million by 2030. The country faces significant challenges related to population growth, including providing adequate healthcare, education, and employment opportunities to its growing population. Urbanization is also a major trend in Bangladesh, with many people moving to cities in search of better economic opportunities. The capital city, Dhaka, is one of the fastest-growing cities in the world and is home to over 20 million people.

The population of Bangladesh is also characterized by significant internal migration patterns, with many people moving from rural areas to urban centers in search of work. This has led to the growth of megacities, such as Dhaka and Chittagong, and has put pressure on the country's infrastructure and services. However, the government has implemented various initiatives to manage population growth and urbanization, including family planning programs and urban development projects.
