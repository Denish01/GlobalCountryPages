The public sector provides **primary healthcare** services through a network of community clinics, union health centers, and district hospitals, while the private sector offers more specialized care through private hospitals and clinics. However, the quality of care can vary significantly depending on the institution, with private facilities generally offering better-equipped and better-staffed services. Access to healthcare is also a significant issue, particularly in rural areas where **healthcare facilities** can be scarce and transportation options limited. In urban areas, such as Dhaka, the capital city, there are more healthcare options available, including specialized hospitals and clinics.\n\nThe public healthcare system in Bangladesh is **underfunded** and **understaffed**, which can lead to long waiting times and limited access to specialized care. In contrast, the private sector is **well-equipped** and offers a range of specialized services, but can be expensive and out of reach for many Bangladeshis. As a result, many people rely on **traditional medicine** or **self-medication**, which can be ineffective and even dangerous. The government has implemented various initiatives to improve the healthcare system, including the introduction of **health insurance schemes** and the expansion of **primary healthcare services**.\n\nDespite these efforts, the healthcare system in Bangladesh still faces significant challenges, including a shortage of **skilled healthcare professionals**, inadequate **infrastructure**, and limited **access to healthcare** in rural areas.
