[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Bangladesh is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **separation of powers** is established by the constitution, which ensures that each branch has distinct responsibilities and limitations. The executive branch is headed by the Prime Minister, who is responsible for appointing ministers and overseeing the implementation of policies. The legislative branch, known as the Jatiya Sangsad, is a unicameral parliament composed of 350 members, with 300 elected by popular vote and 50 reserved for women. The judicial branch is headed by the Supreme Court, which has the power to interpret laws and ensure their conformity with the constitution.

The political system in Bangladesh is characterized by a **unitary structure**, where the central government holds significant power and authority. The country is divided into eight administrative divisions, which are further subdivided into districts, sub-districts, and villages. This structure allows for a high degree of centralization, with the government in Dhaka exercising control over various aspects of public life. However, there are also provisions for **local government**, with elected representatives at the district, sub-district, and village levels.

The **parliamentary system** in Bangladesh is based on the Westminster model, with the Prime Minister and cabinet members accountable to the Jatiya Sangsad. The opposition plays a crucial role in checking the power of the government, and there are provisions for **no-confidence motions** and **impeachment proceedings**. However, the dominance of the ruling party, the Awami League, has raised concerns about the **health of democracy** in Bangladesh.
