[SECTION] Overview: Bangladesh vs Pakistan [/SECTION]
Bangladesh and Pakistan are two neighboring countries in South Asia with distinct economic profiles. Bangladesh has a lower GDP per capita and inflation rate compared to Pakistan, which translates to a lower cost of living. The overall cost of living in Bangladesh is around 10-20% lower than in Pakistan, making it a more attractive option for those looking for affordable living. The economic context of both countries is also different, with Bangladesh having a more diversified economy with a strong textile industry, while Pakistan's economy is more reliant on agriculture and manufacturing.

The cost of living in Bangladesh is generally lower due to the availability of cheap labor, raw materials, and a lower cost of doing business. The country also has a large informal economy, which contributes to the lower cost of living. In contrast, Pakistan has a more formalized economy with higher labor costs and a larger service sector, which drives up the cost of living. However, Pakistan has a more developed infrastructure and a stronger tourism industry, which can make it more attractive to some visitors and expats.
