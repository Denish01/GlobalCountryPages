  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Bangladesh can vary greatly depending on the type of service, location, and whether you choose public or private care, with the average health expenditure per capita being $53.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $53 (2023)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 79.3% (2023)\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 999\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: BDT\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nBangladesh has a mixed healthcare system, which includes both public and private providers. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, resulting in long wait times and limited availability of specialized care. In contrast, private healthcare providers offer higher quality care, but at a significantly higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only option due to financial constraints, while foreigners and affluent locals tend to opt for private care. It is recommended to have health insurance in Bangladesh, especially for foreigners, as the cost of medical care can be high and the quality of public care may not meet international standards.\n\nThe healthcare system in Bangladesh is also heavily reliant on out-of-pocket payments, with 79.3% of healthcare expenditure being paid directly by patients. This can be a significant burden for many people, especially those with limited financial resources. As a result, many people in Bangladesh rely on traditional or alternative forms of medicine, which can be ineffective and even dangerous. For foreigners, it is essential to research and purchase health insurance that covers them in Bangladesh, as many international insurance policies do not provide coverage in the country.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $1-$5 | $10-$50 | Prices vary by city and doctor's qualifications |\n| Specialist Consultation | $5-$20 | $50-$200 | Prices vary by specialty and doctor's experience |\n| Dental Checkup | $5-$10 | $20-$100 | Prices vary by location and dentist's qualifications |\n| Eye Exam | $5-$10 | $20-$100 | Prices vary by location and optometrist's qualifications |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $50-$200 | Prices vary by laboratory and test complexity |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $20-$100 | Prices vary by hospital and severity of condition |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $10-$50 | Prices vary by hospital and room type |\n| Basic Surgery | $100-$1,000 | Prices vary by procedure and surgeon's experience |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $100-$500 | Prices vary by hospital and obstetrician's experience |\n| MRI Scan | $100-$500 | Prices vary by hospital and scan complexity |\n| X-Ray | $10-$50 | Prices vary by hospital and X-ray type |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $10-$30 | Covers basic medical expenses, including doctor visits and hospital stays |\n| Comprehensive Private | $50-$200 | Covers a wide range of medical expenses, including specialist consultations and surgical procedures |\n| International / Expat | $100-$500 | Covers medical expenses worldwide, including evacuation and repatriation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Common medications such as antibiotics and painkillers can be purchased over-the-counter at a cost of $1-$5.\n- Prescription medications can be more expensive, with prices ranging from $5-$50.\n- Pharmacies are widely available in urban areas, but may be limited in rural areas.\n- Many pharmacies offer a wide range of medications, including international brands.\n- It is recommended to purchase medications from reputable pharmacies to ensure quality and authenticity.\n- Some medications may require a prescription from a licensed doctor, while others can be purchased over-the-counter.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the local emergency number, 999, or seek immediate attention at a nearby hospital.
