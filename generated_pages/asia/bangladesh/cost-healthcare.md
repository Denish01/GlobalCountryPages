[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Bangladesh has a mixed healthcare system, which includes both public and private providers. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, resulting in long wait times and limited availability of specialized care. In contrast, private healthcare providers offer higher quality care, but at a significantly higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only option due to financial constraints, while foreigners and affluent locals tend to opt for private care. It is recommended to have health insurance in Bangladesh, especially for foreigners, as the cost of medical care can be high and the quality of public care may not meet international standards.

The healthcare system in Bangladesh is also heavily reliant on out-of-pocket payments, with 79.3% of healthcare expenditure being paid directly by patients. This can be a significant burden for many people, especially those with limited financial resources. As a result, many people in Bangladesh rely on traditional or alternative forms of medicine, which can be ineffective and even dangerous. For foreigners, it is essential to research and purchase health insurance that covers them in Bangladesh, as many international insurance policies do not provide coverage in the country.
