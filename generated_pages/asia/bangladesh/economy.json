  "content": "[FACTBOX]\nGDP (nominal): ($246 billion estimate)\nGDP Per Capita: ($1,513 estimate)\nIncome Classification: (Lower-Middle)\nMain Industries: (textiles, pharmaceuticals, shipbuilding)\nCurrency: BDT\nUnemployment Rate: (4.2% approximate)\nEase of Doing Business: (166th general ranking context)\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]\nBangladesh has a lower-middle-income economy, with a GDP growth rate of around 8% per annum. The country has made significant progress in reducing poverty and improving living standards over the past few decades. The economy is driven primarily by the service sector, which accounts for around 50% of the country's GDP, followed by the industrial sector, which accounts for around 30%. The agricultural sector, although smaller, is still a significant contributor to the economy, employing a large portion of the workforce.\n\nBangladesh's economic development is largely driven by its demographic dividend, with a large and young population providing a significant workforce. The country has also made significant investments in human development, with improvements in education and healthcare. However, the economy still faces significant challenges, including a lack of infrastructure, corruption, and a dependence on a few key industries. The government has implemented various policies and reforms to address these challenges and promote economic growth, including investments in infrastructure and efforts to diversify the economy.\n\nBangladesh's economy is also heavily reliant on remittances from overseas workers, with millions of Bangladeshis working abroad and sending money back to their families. This has helped to boost the country's foreign exchange reserves and support economic growth. However, the economy is also vulnerable to external shocks, including changes in global trade patterns and fluctuations in commodity prices. Overall, Bangladesh's economy has made significant progress in recent years, but still faces challenges in achieving sustainable and inclusive growth.\n\n[SECTION] Key Industries [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Industry | Contribution | Details |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Textiles | 80% of exports | The textile industry is the largest contributor to Bangladesh's exports, with the country producing a wide range of garments, including clothing, fabrics, and textiles. |\n| Pharmaceuticals | 10% of exports | Bangladesh has a growing pharmaceutical industry, with several companies producing medicines and other healthcare products for both domestic and international markets. |\n| Shipbuilding | 5% of exports | The shipbuilding industry is a significant contributor to Bangladesh's economy, with several companies producing ships and other vessels for both domestic and international clients. |\n| Agriculture | 15% of GDP | The agricultural sector is a significant contributor to Bangladesh's economy, with the country producing a wide range of crops, including rice, wheat, and jute. |\n| Services | 50% of GDP | The service sector is the largest contributor to Bangladesh's economy, with the country having a large and growing middle class, driving demand for services such as finance, healthcare, and education. |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Trade Profile [/SECTION]\n**Top Exports:** \n- **Garments**: Bangladesh is one of the world's largest garment producers, with the industry accounting for the majority of the country's exports.\n- **Textiles**: The country produces a wide range of textiles, including clothing, fabrics, and other materials.\n- **Leather goods**: Bangladesh is a significant producer of leather goods, including shoes, belts, and other accessories.\n- **Fish and seafood**: The country has a significant fishing industry, with a large portion of its catch being exported to other countries.\n- **Jute products**: Bangladesh is one of the world's largest producers of jute, with the country exporting a wide range of jute products, including bags, ropes, and other materials.\n\n**Top Imports:** \n- **Machinery**: Bangladesh imports a significant amount of machinery, including textile machinery, industrial equipment, and other machinery.\n- **Electronics**: The country imports a wide range of electronics, including computers, smartphones, and other devices.\n- **Fuel**: Bangladesh imports a significant amount of fuel, including oil, gas, and other petroleum products.\n- **Chemicals**: The country imports a wide range of chemicals, including fertilizers, pesticides, and other industrial chemicals.\n- **Food**: Bangladesh imports a significant amount of food, including grains, sugar, and other edible products.\n\n**Key Trading Partners:** \n- India: Bangladesh's largest trading partner, with the two countries having a significant trade relationship.\n- China: China is a significant trading partner for Bangladesh, with the country importing a wide range of goods from China.\n- United States: The US is a significant market for Bangladeshi exports, particularly garments and textiles.\n- European Union: The EU is also a significant market for Bangladeshi exports, with the country having a preferential trade agreement with the EU.\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n- Bangladesh has a relatively underdeveloped transport network, with a lack of modern roads, railways, and ports.\n- The country has made significant investments in energy infrastructure, including the development of new power plants and transmission lines.\n- Internet and mobile penetration is relatively high in Bangladesh, with a large portion of the population having access to mobile phones and the internet.\n- The country has several major ports, including the Port of Chittagong, which is one of the busiest ports in the region.\n- Bangladesh has several international airports, including Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka, which is the country's main gateway to the world.\n\n[SECTION] Economic Outlook [/SECTION]\nBangladesh's economy is expected to continue growing in the coming years, driven by a combination of domestic and external factors.
