# Bangladesh Culture - Food, Traditions & Etiquette

[SECTION] Cultural Identity [/SECTION]
Bangladesh's culture is a rich and diverse blend of influences, with a strong foundation in Bengali traditions and Islamic values. The country has a long history, with evidence of human habitation dating back to the Stone Age. Over the centuries, Bangladesh has been shaped by various rulers, including the ancient Bengali kingdoms, the Mughal Empire, and the British colonial period. This complex history has resulted in a unique cultural identity, with a mix of Hindu, Buddhist, Muslim, and Christian influences. The majority of the population, around 90%, is Muslim, while the remaining 10% is primarily Hindu. The official language, Bengali, is spoken by the vast majority of the population, and is an important part of the country's cultural identity.

The ethnic and linguistic makeup of Bangladesh is relatively homogeneous, with the Bengali people making up the majority of the population. However, there are also several minority groups, including the Chakma, Marma, and Tripura, who have their own distinct languages and customs. The country's cultural identity is also influenced by its geographic location, with the Ganges-Brahmaputra river delta providing a fertile and densely populated region. This has resulted in a strong emphasis on agriculture and rural life, with many Bangladeshis still living in rural areas and relying on farming for their livelihood.

Bangladesh's cultural identity is also reflected in its vibrant arts and crafts scene, with a strong tradition of music, dance, and visual arts. The country is home to a number of important festivals and celebrations, including the Bengali New Year, Eid al-Fitr, and the Hindu festival of Durga Puja. These events are an important part of the country's cultural calendar, and are often marked with colorful processions, music, and traditional foods.

Eating customs and food culture play a significant role in Bangladeshi society, with mealtimes often being a social and communal affair. In Bangladesh, it is customary to eat with your right hand, as the left hand is considered unclean. Guests are often served first, and it is considered polite to wait for the host to start eating before beginning your meal. The country's cuisine is also heavily influenced by its geographic location, with a emphasis on fresh fish, rice, and vegetables. Street food is also very popular in Bangladesh, with many vendors selling traditional snacks and drinks, such as fuchka and jhal muri.
