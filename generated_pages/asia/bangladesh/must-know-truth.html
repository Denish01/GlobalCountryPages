        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>Bangladesh, officially known as the People's Republic of Bangladesh, has a rich and diverse history that spans over two thousand years. The country was part of the ancient <strong>Vedic</strong> civilization and later became a major center of trade and culture under the <strong>Mughal Empire</strong>. In 1757, the British East India Company defeated the ruler of Bengal, <strong>Siraj-ud-Daula</strong>, and the region became a British colony. Bangladesh was part of the British Indian Empire until 1947, when the Indian subcontinent was partitioned into <strong>India</strong> and <strong>Pakistan</strong>. At that time, the region that is now Bangladesh became the eastern wing of Pakistan, known as <strong>East Pakistan</strong>.</p>
        <p>The country's path to independence was marked by a long and bloody struggle. In 1970, East Pakistan held its first general election, in which the <strong>Awami League</strong>, led by <strong>Sheikh Mujibur Rahman</strong>, won a landslide victory. However, the Pakistani military government refused to transfer power, leading to a civil war that began in March 1971. The war lasted for nine months, resulting in the deaths of an estimated <strong>300,000 to 3 million people</strong>. On December 16, 1971, Bangladesh gained independence from Pakistan, with <strong>Sheikh Mujibur Rahman</strong> becoming the country's first president.</p>
        <p>Bangladesh's early years as an independent nation were marked by poverty, famine, and political instability. In 1975, <strong>Sheikh Mujibur Rahman</strong> was assassinated, and the country experienced a series of military coups and authoritarian regimes. In 1991, Bangladesh transitioned to a <strong>parliamentary democracy</strong>, with <strong>Khaleda Zia</strong> becoming the country's first female prime minister. Today, Bangladesh is a <strong>sovereign</strong> country, with a growing economy and a population of over <strong>172 million people</strong>.</p>
        <p>The country's strategic location, with borders shared by <strong>India</strong> and <strong>Myanmar</strong>, has played a significant role in shaping its history and culture. Bangladesh's coastline along the <strong>Bay of Bengal</strong> has also made it vulnerable to natural disasters, such as cyclones and floods. Despite these challenges, Bangladesh has made significant progress in recent years, with improvements in <strong>education</strong>, <strong>healthcare</strong>, and <strong>infrastructure</strong>.</p>
        <h2>Common Misconceptions</h2>

        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "Bangladesh is a densely populated country with limited access to education and healthcare"</p>

        <p>[CALLOUT] Misconception: "Bangladesh is a country with limited opportunities for women"</p>
