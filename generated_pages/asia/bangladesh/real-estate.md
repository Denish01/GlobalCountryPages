[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The property market in Bangladesh is growing rapidly, driven by a large and increasing population, urbanization, and a rising middle class. The market is dominated by the capital city, Dhaka, which accounts for the majority of property transactions. The current market conditions are characterized by high demand and limited supply, leading to rising prices. The price trajectory is expected to continue upward, with some areas experiencing higher growth than others. Urban areas, such as Dhaka and Chittagong, are more expensive than rural areas, but they also offer better amenities and infrastructure.

The market trends in Bangladesh are influenced by the country's economic growth, with the **real estate sector** playing a significant role in the economy. The sector is expected to continue growing, driven by government initiatives to improve infrastructure and encourage foreign investment. However, the market is also subject to risks, such as **inflation** and **regulatory changes**, which can impact property prices and demand.

The urban-rural divide in Bangladesh is significant, with urban areas offering better job opportunities, education, and healthcare. As a result, there is a high demand for housing in urban areas, particularly in Dhaka, which is driving up prices. In contrast, rural areas are less developed and offer limited job opportunities, leading to lower demand and prices.
