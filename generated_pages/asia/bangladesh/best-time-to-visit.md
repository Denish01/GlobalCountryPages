[CALLOUT] Best months to visit Bangladesh: October to February. Peak season: December to January. Budget season: March to May. Avoid: June to September and the monsoon season due to heavy rainfall and flooding. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Bangladesh has a tropical monsoon climate, characterized by high temperatures and high humidity levels throughout the year. The country can be divided into three main climate zones: the tropical wet climate in the south, the tropical wet and dry climate in the center, and the subtropical monsoon climate in the north. The dry season, which runs from October to February, is the best time to visit Bangladesh, with mild temperatures and minimal rainfall. The wet season, which lasts from March to September, is marked by heavy rainfall and flooding, making it challenging to travel and explore the country.

The seasons in Bangladesh significantly affect travel, with the dry season being the most popular time to visit. During this period, the weather is pleasant, and the roads are passable, making it easy to explore the country's tourist attractions. In contrast, the wet season can be challenging, with heavy rainfall and flooding causing disruptions to transportation and daily life. The monsoon season, which typically runs from June to September, is the worst time to visit Bangladesh, as the heavy rainfall and flooding can make it difficult to travel and explore the country.

The climate in Bangladesh also varies by region, with the coastal areas being more prone to cyclones and flooding during the monsoon season. The hill tracts, on the other hand, are generally cooler and more pleasant during the dry season, making them an ideal destination for trekking and outdoor activities.
