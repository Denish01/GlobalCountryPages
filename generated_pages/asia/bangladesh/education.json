  "content": "The education system in Bangladesh is a complex and multifaceted entity, with a strong emphasis on primary and secondary education, as well as a growing tertiary sector, offering a range of options for both local and international students to study.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nLiteracy Rate: 73.9%\nSchool System: 12 years of compulsory education\nLanguage of Instruction: Bengali\nAcademic Calendar: January to December\nInternational Schools: available\nTop University Ranking: ranked among the top 1000 universities globally\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe education system in Bangladesh is structured into three main levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Primary education, which is compulsory for all children between the ages of 6 and 10, is provided by government-run schools as well as private institutions. Secondary education, which is also compulsory, is divided into two stages: secondary (ages 11-14) and higher secondary (ages 15-17). The quality of education in Bangladesh is generally considered to be good, with a strong emphasis on **science**, **technology**, **engineering**, and **mathematics (STEM)** subjects. However, there are significant disparities between public and private schools, with private schools generally offering higher-quality education and better resources.\n\nThe public education system in Bangladesh is overseen by the Ministry of Education, which is responsible for setting curricula, administering exams, and allocating funding to schools. However, the system is often criticized for being overly bureaucratic and inefficient, with many schools lacking basic resources such as textbooks, furniture, and sanitation facilities. In contrast, private schools in Bangladesh are often well-equipped and offer a more comprehensive education, but are also generally more expensive and inaccessible to many students from low-income backgrounds.\n\nDespite these challenges, the education system in Bangladesh has made significant progress in recent years, with enrollment rates increasing and dropout rates decreasing. The government has also implemented a number of initiatives aimed at improving the quality of education, including the introduction of **free textbooks** for all primary school students and the establishment of a **national curriculum** that emphasizes critical thinking and problem-solving skills.\n\n[SECTION] Top Universities [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| University | Location | Known For | Est.
