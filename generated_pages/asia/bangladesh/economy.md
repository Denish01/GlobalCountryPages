[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Bangladesh has a lower-middle-income economy, with a GDP growth rate of around 8% per annum. The country has made significant progress in reducing poverty and improving living standards over the past few decades. The economy is driven primarily by the service sector, which accounts for around 50% of the country's GDP, followed by the industrial sector, which accounts for around 30%. The agricultural sector, although smaller, is still a significant contributor to the economy, employing a large portion of the workforce.

Bangladesh's economic development is largely driven by its demographic dividend, with a large and young population providing a significant workforce. The country has also made significant investments in human development, with improvements in education and healthcare. However, the economy still faces significant challenges, including a lack of infrastructure, corruption, and a dependence on a few key industries. The government has implemented various policies and reforms to address these challenges and promote economic growth, including investments in infrastructure and efforts to diversify the economy.

Bangladesh's economy is also heavily reliant on remittances from overseas workers, with millions of Bangladeshis working abroad and sending money back to their families. This has helped to boost the country's foreign exchange reserves and support economic growth. However, the economy is also vulnerable to external shocks, including changes in global trade patterns and fluctuations in commodity prices. Overall, Bangladesh's economy has made significant progress in recent years, but still faces challenges in achieving sustainable and inclusive growth.
