[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in Bangladesh has improved significantly over the years, with the average internet speed increasing to 10.06 Mbps download. However, the quality of the internet can vary greatly depending on the location, with urban areas generally having better internet connectivity than rural areas. The urban-rural divide is a significant issue in Bangladesh, with many rural areas lacking access to reliable and fast internet. The reliability of the internet can also be a problem, with frequent outages and slow speeds during peak hours.

Despite these challenges, the internet has become an essential part of daily life in Bangladesh, with many people using it for communication, entertainment, and education. The government has also taken steps to improve internet connectivity, including the launch of several initiatives to expand broadband access to rural areas. However, more needs to be done to address the digital divide and ensure that all citizens have access to reliable and affordable internet.

[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]
Getting a SIM card in Bangladesh is relatively easy, with many mobile operators offering tourist-friendly plans. The main carriers, such as Grameenphone, Robi, and Banglalink, have outlets at major airports and cities, where you can purchase a SIM card and choose a plan that suits your needs. To buy a SIM card, you will need to provide a valid passport and a copy of your visa, if required. The cost of a SIM card can vary depending on the operator and the plan you choose, but you can expect to pay around 10-20 USD for a tourist SIM.

It's recommended to purchase a SIM card from a reputable operator, such as Grameenphone or Robi, as they offer better coverage and faster internet speeds. You can choose from a variety of plans, including prepaid and postpaid options, with data bundles starting from 1 GB. The prices of the plans vary depending on the operator and the amount of data you need, but you can expect to pay around 5-10 USD for a basic plan.
