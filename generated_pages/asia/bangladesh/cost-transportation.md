[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Bangladesh has a diverse range of transportation modes, including buses, taxis, rickshaws, and trains. The quality of public transit varies greatly between cities, with Dhaka having a more comprehensive network of buses and trains compared to other cities. Most people in Bangladesh get around using **rickshaws**, which are a popular and affordable mode of transport, or by walking. The country's transportation infrastructure is often overcrowded and chaotic, especially in urban areas.

The government has been investing in improving the transportation network, including the construction of new roads and highways. However, the lack of a well-planned public transportation system and the increasing number of private vehicles on the road have contributed to traffic congestion and air pollution. Despite these challenges, Bangladesh has made significant progress in recent years in expanding its transportation network and improving the overall quality of transportation services.
