The **separation of powers** is established by the constitution, which ensures that each branch has distinct responsibilities and limitations. The executive branch is headed by the Prime Minister, who is responsible for appointing ministers and overseeing the implementation of policies. The legislative branch, known as the Jatiya Sangsad, is a unicameral parliament composed of 350 members, with 300 elected by popular vote and 50 reserved for women. The judicial branch is headed by the Supreme Court, which has the power to interpret laws and ensure their conformity with the constitution.\n\nThe political system in Bangladesh is characterized by a **unitary structure**, where the central government holds significant power and authority. The country is divided into eight administrative divisions, which are further subdivided into districts, sub-districts, and villages. This structure allows for a high degree of centralization, with the government in Dhaka exercising control over various aspects of public life. However, there are also provisions for **local government**, with elected representatives at the district, sub-district, and village levels.\n\nThe **parliamentary system** in Bangladesh is based on the Westminster model, with the Prime Minister and cabinet members accountable to the Jatiya Sangsad. The opposition plays a crucial role in checking the power of the government, and there are provisions for **no-confidence motions** and **impeachment proceedings**. However, the dominance of the ruling party, the Awami League, has raised concerns about the **health of democracy** in Bangladesh.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | Prime Minister's Office | Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina | Head of Government, policy implementation |\n| Executive | President's Office | President, Mohammed Shahabuddin | Head of State, ceremonial duties |\n| Legislative | Jatiya Sangsad | Speaker, Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury | Lawmaking, oversight of government |\n| Judicial | Supreme Court | Chief Justice, Hasan Foez Siddique | Interpretation of laws, judicial review |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Major Political Parties [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Party | Position | Leader | Seats | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Awami League | Center-left, nationalist | Sheikh Hasina | 302 | Ruling party, dominant force in politics |\n| Bangladesh Nationalist Party | Center-right, nationalist | Tarique Rahman | 7 | Main opposition party, boycotts elections |\n| Jatiya Party | Center-left, nationalist | Raushon Ershad | 26 | Junior partner in ruling coalition |\n| Jamaat-e-Islami | Islamist, conservative | Shafiqur Rahman | 0 | Banned from participating in elections |\n| Workers Party of Bangladesh | Left-wing, socialist | Rashed Khan Menon | 4 | Small but influential party, part of ruling coalition |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Elections [/SECTION]\n- The electoral system in Bangladesh is based on a **first-past-the-post** model, where the candidate with the most votes wins a seat in the Jatiya Sangsad.\n- Elections are held every five years, with the last election taking place in 2018 and the next election scheduled for 2023.\n- The **Electoral Commission** is responsible for overseeing the electoral process, ensuring fairness and transparency.\n- Voter participation has been increasing in recent years, with a turnout of over 80% in the 2018 elections.\n\n[SECTION] Political Stability & Challenges [/SECTION]\n- The current political climate in Bangladesh is characterized by a **dominant ruling party**, with the Awami League holding a significant majority in the Jatiya Sangsad.\n- Key issues facing the country include **poverty reduction**, **infrastructure development**, and **climate change mitigation**.\n- Regional dynamics, particularly with neighboring India and Myanmar, play a crucial role in shaping Bangladesh's foreign policy and security concerns.\n- The country faces challenges related to **human rights**, including freedom of speech, assembly, and the press.\n- The **Corruption Perceptions Index** ranks Bangladesh 146 out of 180 countries, highlighting the need for anti-corruption efforts.\n- The **Global Peace Index** ranks Bangladesh 88 out of 163 countries, indicating a moderate level of stability and security.\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Relations [/SECTION]\n- Bangladesh is a member of the **United Nations**, the **Commonwealth of Nations**, and the **South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation** (SAARC).\n- The country has a **strategic partnership** with India, with cooperation in areas such as trade, security, and energy.\n- Bangladesh has also strengthened ties with **China**, particularly in the areas of infrastructure development and trade.\n- The country is a signatory to the **Paris Agreement** on climate change and has committed to reducing its carbon footprint.\n- Bangladesh has a **diplomatic stance** of non-alignment, seeking to maintain good relations with all countries while avoiding entanglements in global conflicts.",
