The costs of utilities in Bangladesh can be unstable and fluctuate depending on the season, with higher costs during the summer months due to increased demand for electricity and water. The government has been working to improve the utility infrastructure, but the quality of services can vary greatly depending on the location.\n\nThe cost of utilities in Bangladesh is also affected by the inflation rate, which was 10.5% in 2024. This means that the prices of utilities and other goods and services are increasing, making it challenging for people to afford basic necessities. However, the government has implemented measures to subsidize the cost of utilities for low-income households, which has helped to reduce the burden of utility costs on these families.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $20 | $35 | $50 | |\n| Water | $5 | $10 | $15 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $15 | $20 | |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $5 | $10 | $15 | (if separate) |\n| **Total** | **$40** | **$70** | **$100** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $15-25 | 10-30 Mbps | Banglalink, Robi |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $30-50 | 60-100 Mbps | Grameenphone, Teletalk |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $3-5 | 1-5 GB | All providers |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $10-20 | 10-20 GB | All providers |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $25-50 | varies | All providers |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $8 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $5 | |\n| Local Streaming | $3 | (if applicable) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Bangladesh, it is recommended to contact the local utility providers and schedule an appointment for installation.\n- Prepaid electricity meters are available in some areas, which can help households to budget their electricity usage and avoid unexpected bills.\n- The best internet providers in Bangladesh are Banglalink and Grameenphone, which offer fast and reliable internet services.\n- To save on utility bills, households can use energy-efficient appliances, turn off lights and electronics when not in use, and use public transportation or walk instead of driving.\n- It is also recommended to compare prices and plans from different providers to find the best deals and save money on utility bills.",
