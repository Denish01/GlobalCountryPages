The quality of public transit varies greatly between cities, with Dhaka having a more comprehensive network of buses and trains compared to other cities. Most people in Bangladesh get around using **rickshaws**, which are a popular and affordable mode of transport, or by walking. The country's transportation infrastructure is often overcrowded and chaotic, especially in urban areas.\n\nThe government has been investing in improving the transportation network, including the construction of new roads and highways. However, the lack of a well-planned public transportation system and the increasing number of private vehicles on the road have contributed to traffic congestion and air pollution. Despite these challenges, Bangladesh has made significant progress in recent years in expanding its transportation network and improving the overall quality of transportation services.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.20-$0.50 | $10-$20 | Limited coverage, often overcrowded |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available in most cities |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $0.50-$1.00 | N/A | Limited routes, often overcrowded |\n| Commuter Train | $1.00-$2.00 | $20-$50 | Limited routes, often delayed |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $1.00-$2.00 | $0.50-$1.00 | $5-$10 | Often unavailable, may require negotiation |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $1.00-$2.00 | $0.20-$0.50 | $3-$6 | Pathao, Uber, and OBHAI available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $10-$20 | To city center, may vary depending on traffic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20-$1.50 | Prices may vary depending on location |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.00-$1.30 | Prices may vary depending on location |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $30-$50 | Economy car, prices may vary depending on location and rental agency |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1.00-$2.00 | Prices may vary depending on location |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $1.00-$5.00 | Limited toll roads, prices may vary depending on location |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $5-$10 | Limited routes, often overcrowded |\n| Domestic Flight | $50-$100 | Typical route, prices may vary depending on airline and time of year |\n| Train (long-distance) | $10-$20 | Limited routes, often delayed |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider using **rickshaws** or walking for short distances.\n- Use ride-hailing apps like Pathao, Uber, or OBHAI to book taxis or cars.\n- Always negotiate the fare before getting into a metered taxi.\n- Be aware of traffic congestion and plan your route accordingly.\n- Consider purchasing a monthly transit pass for frequent travel on public transportation.\n- Be cautious when using public transportation, especially at night, and consider using a reputable taxi or ride-hailing service instead.",
