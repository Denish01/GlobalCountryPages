The **residency rules** for tax purposes in Bangladesh are based on the individual's physical presence in the country, with residents defined as those who have been present in the country for at least 182 days in a calendar year.

The tax system in Bangladesh is administered by the **National Board of Revenue (NBR)**, which is responsible for collecting taxes, enforcing tax laws, and providing taxpayer services. The NBR also provides guidance and support to taxpayers through its website, taxpayer assistance centers, and other channels. Bangladesh has a relatively complex tax system, with multiple tax rates, exemptions, and deductions available, making it essential for taxpayers to seek professional advice to ensure compliance with tax laws.
