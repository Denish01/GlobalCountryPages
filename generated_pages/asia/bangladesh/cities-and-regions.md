[SECTION] How Bangladesh Is Divided [/SECTION]
Bangladesh is divided into 8 administrative divisions, which are further subdivided into 64 districts. The divisions are Dhaka, Chittagong, Sylhet, Khulna, Barisal, Rajshahi, Rangpur, and Mymensingh. Each division has its own unique character and plays a significant role in the country's economy, culture, and politics. The divisions are also divided into upazilas or sub-districts, which are the second-tier administrative units.

The administrative structure of Bangladesh is designed to provide effective governance and delivery of public services to its large and diverse population. The divisions are responsible for implementing national policies and programs, while the districts and upazilas are responsible for providing basic services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure. The administrative structure also provides a framework for decentralization and participation of local communities in the decision-making process.
