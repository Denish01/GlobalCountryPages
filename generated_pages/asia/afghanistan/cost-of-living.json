[/SECTION]\nAfghanistan is considered an affordable country to live in or visit, with a cost of living that is lower compared to many other countries in Asia. The cost of accommodation, food, and transportation is relatively low, making it an attractive destination for budget travelers and expats. However, the country's economy has been affected by years of conflict and instability, which can impact the availability and quality of certain goods and services. Compared to its neighbors, Afghanistan is generally cheaper than Iran and Pakistan, but more expensive than some of the Central Asian countries such as Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.\n\nThe cost of living in Afghanistan can vary depending on the location, with cities like Kabul and Mazar-i-Sharif tend to be more expensive than smaller towns and rural areas. Additionally, the country's security situation can also impact the cost of living, with some areas being more expensive due to the need for additional security measures. Overall, Afghanistan offers a unique and affordable experience for those who are willing to adapt to its challenging environment.\n\n[SECTION] Accommodation Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Price Range (USD/night) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Hostel/Budget | $5-15 | Basic rooms with shared facilities |\n| Mid-Range Hotel | $20-50 | Private rooms with en-suite bathrooms and basic amenities |\n| Luxury/Resort | $50-150 | High-end hotels with modern amenities and security features |\n| Apartment Rent (monthly) | $100-500 | City center apartments tend to be more expensive than those outside the city |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $1-3 |\n| Casual Restaurant | $5-10 |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $15-30 |\n| Fine Dining | $30-50 |\n| Beer (local) | $2-5 |\n| Coffee | $1-2 |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $0.50-1 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport | Cost (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Local bus/metro ride | $0.20-0.50 |\n| Taxi (per km) | $0.50-1 |\n| Domestic flight | $50-100 |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $0.50-1 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Breakdown [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Category | Budget ($) | Mid-Range ($) | Comfortable ($) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rent | 100-200 | 200-400 | 400-800 |\n| Food | 100-200 | 200-400 | 400-600 |\n| Transport | 50-100 | 100-200 | 200-300 |\n| Utilities | 50-100 | 100-200 | 200-300 |\n| Entertainment | 50-100 | 100-200 | 200-300 |\n| **Total** | **400-700** | **700-1,400** | **1,400-2,400** |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Money-Saving Tips [/SECTION]\n- Consider staying in guesthouses or hostels, which are often cheaper than hotels and offer a more authentic experience.\n- Eat at local restaurants and street food stalls, which serve delicious and affordable meals.\n- Use public transportation or walk whenever possible, as taxis can be expensive.\n- Avoid traveling during peak season (summer) when prices tend to be higher.\n- Learn some basic Pashto and Dari phrases, which can help you negotiate prices and interact with locals.\n- Be mindful of your surroundings and take necessary security precautions, as this can help you avoid additional costs associated with security measures.",
