[SECTION] Overview: Afghanistan vs Pakistan [/SECTION]
Afghanistan and Pakistan are two neighboring countries in South Asia with distinct economic profiles. Afghanistan has a lower GDP per capita and a smaller economy, which contributes to its lower cost of living. The country's economy is largely driven by agriculture and remittances from abroad, while Pakistan has a more diversified economy with a strong services sector. The cost of living in Afghanistan is generally lower due to the country's lower economic development and lower demand for goods and services. However, the cost of living in Pakistan is also relatively low compared to other countries in the region, making it an attractive destination for expats and travelers.

The overall cost of living difference between Afghanistan and Pakistan is around 20-30% in many categories, with Afghanistan being the cheaper option. However, the cost of living can vary significantly depending on the location, with cities like Kabul and Islamabad being more expensive than smaller towns and rural areas. Additionally, the security situation in Afghanistan can also impact the cost of living, with some areas being more expensive due to the need for security measures. In contrast, Pakistan has a more stable security environment, which can make it a more attractive option for some expats and travelers.
