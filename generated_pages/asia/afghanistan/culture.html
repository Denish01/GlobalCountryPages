        <h2>Cultural Identity</h2>
        <p>Afghanistan's culture is a rich and diverse tapestry, woven from the threads of its strategic location at the crossroads of Asia. The country's unique cultural identity is defined by its <strong>Islamic heritage</strong>, with the majority of the population practicing Islam. The ethnic and linguistic makeup of Afghanistan is also diverse, with <strong>Pashtuns</strong> and <strong>Tajiks</strong> being the two largest ethnic groups, and <strong>Pashto</strong> and <strong>Dari</strong> being the official languages. The country's history has been shaped by the influences of various invading empires, including the <strong>Persians</strong>, <strong>Greeks</strong>, and <strong>Mongols</strong>, each leaving behind a lasting legacy.</p>
        <p>The cultural landscape of Afghanistan is also characterized by its <strong>tribal traditions</strong>, with many Afghans still identifying themselves by their tribal affiliations. The <strong>Code of Pashtunwali</strong>, a set of traditional laws and customs, is still widely observed, particularly among the Pashtun population. This code emphasizes the importance of <strong>hospitality</strong>, <strong>loyalty</strong>, and <strong>respect</strong> for elders and guests. The cultural identity of Afghanistan is also reflected in its <strong>traditional clothing</strong>, with men often wearing the <strong>shalwar kameez</strong> and women wearing the <strong>burqa</strong> or <strong>hijab</strong>.</p>
        <p>Afghanistan's cultural identity is also influenced by its <strong>geography</strong>, with the country's rugged terrain and harsh climate shaping the daily lives of its people. The country's <strong>agricultural traditions</strong>, with many Afghans engaged in farming and herding, have also played a significant role in shaping its cultural identity. The country's <strong>cultural heritage</strong>, with its many <strong>historical sites</strong> and <strong>monuments</strong>, is also an important part of its cultural identity, with many Afghans taking great pride in their rich cultural history.</p>
