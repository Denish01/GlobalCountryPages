[SECTION] Overview: Afghanistan vs Uzbekistan [/SECTION]
Afghanistan and Uzbekistan are two neighboring countries in Central Asia with distinct economic profiles. Afghanistan has a relatively low GDP per capita and a high inflation rate, which contributes to its lower cost of living. In contrast, Uzbekistan has a higher GDP per capita and a more stable economy, resulting in a higher cost of living. The overall cost of living in Afghanistan is approximately 20-30% lower than in Uzbekistan, making it a more affordable option for expats, students, and travelers.

The economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. Afghanistan's economy is largely driven by agriculture and remittances, while Uzbekistan's economy is more diversified, with a strong focus on industry and services. This diversity in Uzbekistan's economy contributes to its higher cost of living, as the country has a more developed infrastructure and a higher standard of living. In contrast, Afghanistan's economy is still recovering from decades of conflict, which has limited its development and kept costs relatively low.
