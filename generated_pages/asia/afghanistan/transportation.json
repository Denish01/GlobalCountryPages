The airport receives direct flights from major hubs such as Dubai, Istanbul, and New Delhi. Other international airports in the country include Kandahar International Airport and Mazar-i-Sharif International Airport. Overland entry points are also available, with major border crossings located at the borders with Iran, Pakistan, and the Central Asian countries.

Additionally, ensure that you have all the necessary documents, including a valid visa and passport. The country's borders with its neighbors are generally open, but the security situation can be unpredictable, and it is crucial to stay informed about any developments that may affect your travel plans.
