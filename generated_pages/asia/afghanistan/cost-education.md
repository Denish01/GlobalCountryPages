[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Afghanistan is still recovering from decades of conflict, with significant disparities between public and private education quality. Public schools, which are free or subsidized, often struggle with inadequate infrastructure, limited resources, and a shortage of qualified teachers, resulting in lower education quality. In contrast, private schools, which can be quite expensive, often offer better facilities, more qualified teachers, and a more comprehensive curriculum. The language of instruction in public schools is typically **Pashto** or **Dari**, while private schools may offer instruction in English or other languages. Compulsory education in Afghanistan lasts for 12 years, from age 6 to 18, and international schools are available in major cities like Kabul, offering curricula such as the International Baccalaureate (IB) or the British GCSE.

Despite the challenges, the Afghan government has made significant efforts to improve the education system, including increasing access to education, particularly for girls, and improving teacher training. However, much work remains to be done to address the significant disparities in education quality and access. International schools in Afghanistan cater to expatriate families and offer a range of curricula, including the IB, GCSE, and American high school diplomas. These schools often have better facilities, more qualified teachers, and a more comprehensive curriculum than public schools, but can be very expensive.
