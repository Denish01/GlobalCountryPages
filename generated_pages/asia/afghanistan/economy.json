The country's economic development has been hindered by decades of conflict, corruption, and lack of investment in infrastructure. Despite these challenges, Afghanistan has made significant progress in recent years, with the economy growing at an average rate of 4% per year from 2015 to 2020. However, the country still faces significant development challenges, including a large trade deficit, high unemployment, and a reliance on foreign aid. The economy is primarily driven by the services sector, which accounts for approximately 50% of GDP, followed by agriculture and mining.\n\nThe country's economic classification is a low-income economy, with a Human Development Index (HDI) ranking of 168 out of 189 countries. The economy is also highly dependent on foreign aid, with international assistance accounting for approximately 40% of the country's budget. The government has implemented various reforms aimed at improving the business environment and promoting economic growth, including the establishment of a new investment law and the creation of a number of special economic zones.\n\nDespite these efforts, the economy still faces significant challenges, including a lack of infrastructure, a shortage of skilled labor, and a high level of corruption. The country is also highly vulnerable to external shocks, including changes in global commodity prices and fluctuations in international aid. To address these challenges, the government has developed a number of strategic plans, including the Afghanistan National Development Strategy, which aims to promote economic growth, reduce poverty, and improve living standards.\n\n[SECTION] Key Industries [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Industry | Contribution | Details |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Agriculture | 20% of GDP | Main crops include wheat, corn, and fruits, with a significant portion of the population engaged in farming |\n| Mining | 10% of GDP | Afghanistan is rich in natural resources, including copper, iron, and lithium, with a number of large-scale mining projects underway |\n| Services | 50% of GDP | Includes finance, trade, and transportation, with a growing number of small and medium-sized enterprises |\n| Manufacturing | 5% of GDP | Main products include textiles, food processing, and construction materials, with a number of industrial parks and special economic zones |\n| Construction | 5% of GDP | Driven by government investment in infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and buildings |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Trade Profile [/SECTION]\n**Top Exports:** \n- **Agricultural products**, such as fruits, nuts, and carpets, which account for approximately 20% of total exports\n- **Minerals**, including copper, iron, and lithium, which account for approximately 30% of total exports\n- **Textiles**, including clothing and fabrics, which account for approximately 10% of total exports\n- **Carpet and rugs**, which are highly prized for their quality and account for approximately 5% of total exports\n- **Fresh and dried fruits**, including grapes, apricots, and almonds, which are in high demand in regional markets\n**Top Imports:** \n- **Machinery and equipment**, including vehicles and electronics\n- **Fuel and petroleum products**, including gasoline and diesel\n- **Food and beverages**, including wheat, rice, and sugar\n- **Textiles and clothing**, including fabrics and finished garments\n- **Medicines and pharmaceuticals**, including essential medicines and medical equipment\n**Key Trading Partners:** \n- Pakistan, which accounts for approximately 30% of total trade\n- India, which accounts for approximately 20% of total trade\n- China, which accounts for approximately 15% of total trade\n- Iran, which accounts for approximately 10% of total trade\n- United Arab Emirates, which accounts for approximately 5% of total trade\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n- The country's transport network is limited, with a total of approximately 12,000 kilometers of roads, including 2,000 kilometers of paved roads\n- The energy sector is underdeveloped, with a total installed capacity of approximately 500 megawatts, and a reliance on imported fuel\n- Internet and mobile penetration are increasing, with approximately 20% of the population having access to the internet and 60% having access to mobile phones\n- The country has a number of ports and airports, including the Kabul International Airport and the Kandahar International Airport\n- The government has invested in a number of infrastructure projects, including the construction of new roads, bridges, and energy generation facilities\n\n[SECTION] Economic Outlook [/SECTION]\nThe Afghan economy is expected to continue growing in the coming years, driven by a combination of factors, including increased investment in infrastructure, a growing services sector, and a rise in agricultural production.
