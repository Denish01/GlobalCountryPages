[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Afghanistan has several international airports, with Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul being the main entry point for most travelers. The airport receives direct flights from major hubs such as Dubai, Istanbul, and New Delhi. Other international airports in the country include Kandahar International Airport and Mazar-i-Sharif International Airport. Overland entry points are also available, with major border crossings located at the borders with Iran, Pakistan, and the Central Asian countries. However, traveling overland can be challenging due to the rough terrain and security concerns.

For those planning to enter Afghanistan by land, it is essential to research the current security situation and any travel restrictions before embarking on your journey. Additionally, ensure that you have all the necessary documents, including a valid visa and passport. The country's borders with its neighbors are generally open, but the security situation can be unpredictable, and it is crucial to stay informed about any developments that may affect your travel plans. Direct flight hubs to Afghanistan include Dubai, Istanbul, and Islamabad, with airlines such as Emirates, Turkish Airlines, and Pakistan International Airlines operating regular flights to the country.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Domestic flights are available in Afghanistan, although the network is limited. The main domestic airlines operating in the country are Ariana Afghan Airlines and Kam Air, which offer flights between major cities such as Kabul, Kandahar, and Mazar-i-Sharif. Booking domestic flights can be done through the airlines' websites or at their offices in the cities. Approximate costs for domestic flights range from $100 to $200 per person for a one-way ticket, depending on the route and airline. It is recommended to book in advance, especially during peak travel seasons, to ensure availability.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Afghanistan has no rail network, making train travel impossible in the country. The lack of a rail system is due to the country's rugged terrain and the high cost of building and maintaining railways. As a result, other modes of transportation, such as buses, taxis, and private car rentals, are more commonly used for both domestic and international travel.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Intercity bus companies operate in Afghanistan, connecting major cities such as Kabul, Kandahar, and Mazar-i-Sharif. The bus network is relatively extensive, with several private companies offering services, including the **Milli Bus** company. However, the quality of the buses and roads can vary greatly, and travel times can be long due to the rough terrain and security concerns. Costs for bus travel are generally low, ranging from $5 to $20 per person for a one-way ticket, depending on the route and company.
