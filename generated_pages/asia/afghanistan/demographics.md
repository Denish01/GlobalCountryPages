[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Afghanistan's population has been steadily increasing over the years, with a growth rate of 2.3% per annum. The country's population size is significant in the context of its geographic location, with a large youthful population and a relatively low urbanization rate. The population is expected to continue growing, with estimates suggesting that it will reach 50 million by 2030. Afghanistan's urban population is growing rapidly, with many people migrating from rural areas to cities in search of better economic opportunities, education, and healthcare. The country's population is also affected by migration patterns, with many Afghans seeking refuge in neighboring countries or migrating to other parts of the world in search of better living conditions.

The population of Afghanistan is also affected by the country's history of conflict and instability, which has led to a significant number of internally displaced persons and refugees. The country's population growth rate is also influenced by its high fertility rate, with an average of 4.6 children per woman. The population density of Afghanistan is relatively low, with an average of 51 people per square kilometer. However, the population density varies significantly across different regions, with the capital city Kabul being one of the most densely populated areas.

The life expectancy in Afghanistan is approximately 61 years, which is lower than the average life expectancy in other countries in the region. The country's healthcare system is still developing, and many people lack access to basic healthcare services, particularly in rural areas. Despite these challenges, Afghanistan has made significant progress in recent years in improving healthcare services and reducing mortality rates.
