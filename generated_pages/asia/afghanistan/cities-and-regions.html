        <h2>How Afghanistan Is Divided</h2>
        <p>Afghanistan is divided into 34 provinces, each with its own provincial capital. These provinces are further divided into districts, which are the second-level administrative units. The provinces are grouped into several regions, with the capital city of Kabul being the largest and most populous city. The administrative structure of Afghanistan is designed to provide a framework for governance and development, with each province having its own governor and provincial council.</p>
        <p>The provinces of Afghanistan are diverse in terms of geography, culture, and economy. The country's mountainous terrain and lack of infrastructure have historically made it difficult to travel between provinces, which has contributed to the development of distinct regional identities. However, in recent years, efforts have been made to improve transportation networks and promote economic development across the country.</p>

        <h2>Getting Around</h2>
        <p>Afghanistan has a limited transportation network, with few paved roads and limited domestic flights. The country's mountainous terrain and lack of infrastructure make it difficult to travel between provinces, and many roads are closed during the winter months due to heavy snowfall. However, efforts are being made to improve the transportation network, with new roads and airports being built. The most common mode of transportation is by bus or taxi, with many private companies operating between major cities. Driving conditions can be hazardous, especially on rural roads, and visitors are advised to exercise caution when traveling by car.</p>
        <p>Domestic flights are available between major cities, with several airlines operating regular services. However, flights can be unreliable and are often subject to cancellation due to weather conditions or security concerns. Trains are not a common mode of transportation in Afghanistan, with only a few lines operating between major cities. The country's transportation network is still developing, and visitors are advised to plan carefully and exercise caution when traveling. [CALLOUT] Visitors should research their route carefully and stay up to date with the latest travel advisories before traveling to Afghanistan.</p>
