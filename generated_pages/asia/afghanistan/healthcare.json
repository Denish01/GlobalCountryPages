  "content": "Healthcare in Afghanistan is a challenging and evolving system, with significant disparities between urban and rural areas, and a strong need for international support and development.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nQuality Rating: Basic\nEmergency Number: 112\nHospital Standard: Basic\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: limited\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nAfghanistan's healthcare system is a mixed model, with both public and private providers playing a role. The public sector is the primary provider of healthcare services, with a network of hospitals, health centers, and clinics throughout the country. However, the quality of care and access to services vary greatly between urban and rural areas, with rural areas often having limited access to healthcare facilities and specialized care. The private sector is also growing, with many private hospitals and clinics, especially in urban areas, offering a range of services, including specialized care. Despite these efforts, the overall quality of care in Afghanistan is still considered basic, with significant challenges in terms of infrastructure, equipment, and trained healthcare professionals.\n\nThe Afghan government has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, including the development of a national health strategy and the establishment of a ministry of public health. However, the country still faces significant challenges, including a shortage of healthcare professionals, limited access to healthcare services, and a lack of infrastructure and equipment. International organizations and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are also playing a crucial role in supporting the development of the healthcare system in Afghanistan.\n\nThe healthcare system in Afghanistan is also heavily reliant on international aid and support, with many international organizations and NGOs providing financial and technical assistance to the government and healthcare providers. This support has helped to improve access to healthcare services, particularly in rural areas, and has also helped to strengthen the capacity of the healthcare system to respond to emergencies and outbreaks.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Indira Gandhi Children's Hospital | Kabul | Public | Pediatrics, Neonatology | Limited |\n| Jamhuriat Hospital | Kabul | Public | General Medicine, Surgery | Limited |\n| Sardar Mohammad Daud Khan Hospital | Kabul | Public | General Medicine, Surgery | Limited |\n| French Medical Institute for Mothers and Children | Kabul | Private | Pediatrics, Obstetrics | Yes |\n| CURE International Hospital | Kabul | Private | Orthopedics, Rehabilitation | Yes |\n| Emergency Hospital | Kabul | Private | Emergency Medicine, Trauma | Limited |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- Expats and foreigners are recommended to have international health insurance that covers them in Afghanistan, as local insurance options may not provide adequate coverage.\n- Local insurance options are available, but they may not cover all medical expenses, and the quality of care may vary.\n- The Afghan government has introduced a national health insurance scheme, but it is still in the early stages of development and may not provide comprehensive coverage.\n- Private health insurance is available, but it can be expensive and may not be widely available.\n- Some employers may offer health insurance as part of their benefits package, but this is not always the case.\n- It is essential to research and compare different insurance options before making a decision, as the cost and quality of care can vary significantly.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- Medications are available in major cities, but access can be limited in rural areas.\n- Prescription requirements vary, and some medications may be available over-the-counter.\n- Common brands of medications are available, but the quality and authenticity of medications can be a concern.\n- The cost of medications can be high, particularly for specialized or imported medications.\n- It is recommended to bring a supply of essential medications and to research local pharmacies and medication options before traveling to Afghanistan.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- Vaccinations against **hepatitis A**, **hepatitis B**, and **typhoid** are recommended for all travelers to Afghanistan.\n- Vaccinations against **rabies** and **meningitis** may also be recommended, depending on the specific travel plans and activities.\n- Afghanistan is considered a high-risk country for **malaria**, and travelers should take precautions to prevent mosquito bites.\n- **Waterborne illnesses** are common, and travelers should avoid drinking untreated water and eat only cooked foods.\n- **Food safety** is also a concern, and travelers should avoid eating undercooked or raw foods.\n- **Respiratory illnesses**, such as **tuberculosis**, are common in Afghanistan, and travelers should take precautions to avoid close contact with people who are sick.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- Afghanistan is not a typical destination for medical tourism, due to the limited availability of specialized medical care and the challenges of traveling in the country.\n- However, some private hospitals and clinics in Kabul may offer specialized care, such as **orthopedic surgery** or **rehabilitation services**.\n- The cost of medical care in Afghanistan can be lower than in other countries, but the quality of care and the availability of specialized services can be a concern.\n- It is essential to research and carefully evaluate any medical tourism options in Afghanistan, considering factors such as the quality of care, the qualifications of healthcare professionals, and the availability of emergency services.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- In the event of a medical emergency, call the emergency number **112** or contact a private hospital or clinic directly.\n- Ambulance services are limited, and emergency response times can be slow.\n- It is recommended to have a plan in place for emergency medical evacuation, such as a medevac insurance policy or a contract with a private emergency medical services provider.\n- Nearest hospitals and clinics should be identified in advance, and their contact information and services should be researched.\n- Insurance claims can be complex and time-consuming, and it is essential to understand the terms and conditions of any insurance policy before traveling to Afghanistan.",
