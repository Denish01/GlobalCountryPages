[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Afghanistan is largely driven by the demand for housing in urban areas, particularly in the capital city of Kabul. The typical lease term for a rental agreement in Afghanistan is one year, with a deposit requirement of one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are limited, and disputes are often resolved through traditional mediation. Compared to its regional neighbors, Afghanistan's housing costs are relatively moderate, with prices lower than in Iran and Pakistan but higher than in some of the Central Asian countries. The housing market in Afghanistan is also influenced by the country's security situation, with prices and demand fluctuating in response to changes in the security environment.

The affordability of housing in Afghanistan is a significant challenge, particularly for low-income households. The country's **GDP per capita** is relatively low, and the **inflation rate** can be volatile, which can affect the purchasing power of households. Additionally, the **health expenditure per capita** is relatively low, which can impact the overall well-being of the population. The **out-of-pocket health spend** is also high, which can further exacerbate the affordability challenges faced by households. As a result, many Afghans rely on informal housing arrangements, such as shared accommodations or makeshift shelters.
