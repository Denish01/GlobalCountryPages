The **inflation rate** of -6.6% in 2024 has contributed to relatively stable food prices, making it easier for locals and visitors to afford basic necessities. However, the **out-of-pocket health spend** of 77.1% of the population's health expenditure can be a significant burden, leaving limited funds for food and other expenses. Eating out is not a common practice in Afghanistan, and most people prefer to cook at home, which is often more affordable and convenient. The traditional **Afghan cuisine** is based on fresh produce, meats, and grains, which are readily available in local markets and relatively inexpensive.\n\nThe cost of food in Afghanistan is generally lower compared to other countries in the region, making it an attractive destination for travelers and expatriates. However, the prices of imported goods, such as **foreign beers** and **processed foods**, can be higher due to transportation costs and taxes. The **GDP per capita PPP** of $2,202 in 2023 indicates a relatively low standard of living, which is reflected in the affordable food prices. Overall, Afghanistan offers a unique and affordable culinary experience, with a mix of traditional and modern dining options available.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $1.50 | 120 AFN | |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $0.50 | 40 AFN | |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $1.20 | 100 AFN | |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $1.00 | 80 AFN | |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $3.50 | 280 AFN | |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $5.00 | 400 AFN | |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $1.80 | 140 AFN | |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $1.20 | 100 AFN | |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $0.80 | 60 AFN | |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $0.60 | 50 AFN | |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $4.00 | 320 AFN | |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $0.80 | 60 AFN | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $2-$5 | (typical dishes like kebabs, bolani) |\n| Casual Restaurant | $5-$10 | (one person, basic meal) |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $15-$25 | (3 courses, moderate quality) |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $30-$50 | (upscale, high-quality ingredients) |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $5-$10 | |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $8-$15 | |\n| Cappuccino | $2-$4 | |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $1-$2 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nThe prices of groceries in Afghanistan can vary significantly depending on whether you shop at a **supermarket** or a **local market**. Supermarkets tend to offer a wider range of products, including imported goods, but at higher prices. Local markets, on the other hand, offer fresh produce, meats, and grains at lower prices, but the quality and variety may be limited. It is recommended to buy **fresh produce** and **meats** at local markets, where you can find better deals and fresher products. For **imported goods** and **processed foods**, supermarkets may be a better option, although prices will be higher.\n\nWhen shopping at local markets, it is essential to **bargain**, as prices are often negotiable. Vendors may initially quote higher prices, but you can usually negotiate a better deal by offering a lower price or walking away. This practice is common in Afghan culture and is expected by vendors. Supermarkets, on the other hand, have fixed prices, and bargaining is not an option. Overall, a combination of shopping at local markets and supermarkets can help you find the best deals and variety of products in Afghanistan.\n\n[SECTION] Local Food Tips [/SECTION]\n- The cheapest way to eat in Afghanistan is to buy **street food** or **local eatery** meals, which can cost as little as $2-$5 USD per person.\n- **Bolani**, a traditional Afghan flatbread, is a filling and affordable snack that can be found at local markets and eateries.\n- **Kebabs** are a popular and affordable dish in Afghanistan, made with marinated meats and served with naan bread and vegetables.\n- **Fresh produce** is widely available and relatively inexpensive in Afghanistan, making it a great option for healthy and affordable meals.\n- **Local cheese** and **yogurt** are also good value and can be found at local markets and supermarkets.\n- Avoid buying **imported goods**, such as foreign beers and processed foods, as they can be expensive and may not be widely available.",
