[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Afghanistan's healthcare system is a mixed model, with both public and private providers playing a role. The public sector is the primary provider of healthcare services, with a network of hospitals, health centers, and clinics throughout the country. However, the quality of care and access to services vary greatly between urban and rural areas, with rural areas often having limited access to healthcare facilities and specialized care. The private sector is also growing, with many private hospitals and clinics, especially in urban areas, offering a range of services, including specialized care. Despite these efforts, the overall quality of care in Afghanistan is still considered basic, with significant challenges in terms of infrastructure, equipment, and trained healthcare professionals.

The Afghan government has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, including the development of a national health strategy and the establishment of a ministry of public health. However, the country still faces significant challenges, including a shortage of healthcare professionals, limited access to healthcare services, and a lack of infrastructure and equipment. International organizations and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are also playing a crucial role in supporting the development of the healthcare system in Afghanistan.

The healthcare system in Afghanistan is also heavily reliant on international aid and support, with many international organizations and NGOs providing financial and technical assistance to the government and healthcare providers. This support has helped to improve access to healthcare services, particularly in rural areas, and has also helped to strengthen the capacity of the healthcare system to respond to emergencies and outbreaks.
