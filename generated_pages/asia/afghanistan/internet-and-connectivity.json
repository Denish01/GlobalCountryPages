  "content": "The internet in Afghanistan is relatively slow and unreliable, with an average download speed of 5 Mbps, but it has been improving in recent years, especially in major cities like Kabul. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nAverage Internet Speed: 5 Mbps download\nMobile Network Coverage: Moderate\nMain Carriers: Roshan, MTN, Etisalat\nSIM Card Cost: 5 USD for tourist SIM\nWiFi Availability: Limited\n5G Available: No\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]\nThe internet in Afghanistan is largely affected by the country's infrastructure and geographic challenges. The average internet speed is around 5 Mbps, which is relatively slow compared to other countries in the region. However, there are significant differences in internet quality between urban and rural areas. In cities like Kabul, the internet is more reliable and faster, with many internet service providers offering relatively stable connections. In contrast, rural areas often have limited or no access to the internet, making it difficult for people to stay connected. The reliability of the internet is also a concern, with frequent outages and disruptions reported, especially during peak hours or in areas with high demand.\n\nDespite these challenges, there are efforts to improve the internet infrastructure in Afghanistan. The government has launched initiatives to expand mobile network coverage and increase internet penetration, especially in rural areas. Additionally, many internet service providers are investing in new technologies, such as fiber-optic cables, to improve the speed and reliability of their services. However, more needs to be done to address the significant urban-rural divide and provide equal access to the internet for all citizens.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nTo get a SIM card in Afghanistan, tourists can visit one of the many mobile network operator stores or authorized dealers in major cities. The main carriers, such as Roshan, MTN, and Etisalat, offer a range of prepaid plans, including tourist-friendly options. To purchase a SIM card, tourists typically need to provide a valid passport and a copy of their visa. The cost of a SIM card is around 5 USD, and data plans can range from 1-10 USD per month, depending on the carrier and the amount of data included. It's recommended to purchase a SIM card from a reputable dealer or store to avoid any potential scams or issues with the card.\n\n[TABLE]\n| Carrier | Tourist Plan | Data | Price (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roshan | Tourist Plan | 1 GB | 5 USD | Valid for 30 days |\n| MTN | Visitor Plan | 2 GB | 10 USD | Valid for 30 days |\n| Etisalat | Traveler Plan | 3 GB | 15 USD | Valid for 30 days |\n| Afghan Wireless | Visitor Plan | 1 GB | 3 USD | Valid for 30 days |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] WiFi Availability [/SECTION]\n- Hotel WiFi quality is generally good, with many hotels offering free WiFi to their guests.\n- Cafe WiFi culture is not very common in Afghanistan, but some modern cafes in major cities may offer free WiFi to customers.\n- Coworking spaces are limited, but some cities like Kabul have a few options that offer reliable WiFi and other amenities.\n- Public WiFi is not widely available, but some government offices and public buildings may offer free WiFi.\n- Some restaurants and shops may also offer free WiFi to customers, but the quality and reliability can vary.\n\n[SECTION] For Remote Workers [/SECTION]\n- Coworking spaces like the Kabul Coworking Space and the Afghanistan Center for Excellence offer reliable WiFi and other amenities for remote workers.\n- Reliable cafe chains like the Green Tea Cafe and the Kabul Cafe offer free WiFi and a comfortable working environment.\n- Backup internet options like mobile hotspots and satellite internet can be useful in case of outages or disruptions.\n- VPNs are recommended to ensure secure and private internet connections, especially when working with sensitive data.\n- Some hotels and guesthouses also offer coworking spaces and reliable WiFi for remote workers.\n\n[SECTION] Tips & Warnings [/SECTION]\n- Internet censorship is a concern in Afghanistan, with some websites and online services blocked by the government.\n- Blocked sites include some social media platforms, news websites, and online services that are deemed to be against the country's laws and regulations.\n- VPNs are recommended to bypass internet censorship and ensure secure and private internet connections.\n- Roaming alternatives like international SIM cards or portable WiFi hotspots can be useful for travelers who need to stay connected.\n- eSIM options are not widely available in Afghanistan, but some mobile network operators may offer eSIM plans for tourists and travelers.\n- It's also important to be aware of the local laws and regulations regarding internet use, especially when it comes to sensitive topics like politics and religion.",
