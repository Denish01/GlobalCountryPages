[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in Afghanistan is largely affected by the country's infrastructure and geographic challenges. The average internet speed is around 5 Mbps, which is relatively slow compared to other countries in the region. However, there are significant differences in internet quality between urban and rural areas. In cities like Kabul, the internet is more reliable and faster, with many internet service providers offering relatively stable connections. In contrast, rural areas often have limited or no access to the internet, making it difficult for people to stay connected. The reliability of the internet is also a concern, with frequent outages and disruptions reported, especially during peak hours or in areas with high demand.

Despite these challenges, there are efforts to improve the internet infrastructure in Afghanistan. The government has launched initiatives to expand mobile network coverage and increase internet penetration, especially in rural areas. Additionally, many internet service providers are investing in new technologies, such as fiber-optic cables, to improve the speed and reliability of their services. However, more needs to be done to address the significant urban-rural divide and provide equal access to the internet for all citizens.

[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]
To get a SIM card in Afghanistan, tourists can visit one of the many mobile network operator stores or authorized dealers in major cities. The main carriers, such as Roshan, MTN, and Etisalat, offer a range of prepaid plans, including tourist-friendly options. To purchase a SIM card, tourists typically need to provide a valid passport and a copy of their visa. The cost of a SIM card is around 5 USD, and data plans can range from 1-10 USD per month, depending on the carrier and the amount of data included. It's recommended to purchase a SIM card from a reputable dealer or store to avoid any potential scams or issues with the card.
