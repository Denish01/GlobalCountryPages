In urban areas like Kabul, the infrastructure is more developed, but in rural areas, access to basic utilities like electricity and water can be limited. The cost of utilities in Afghanistan can fluctuate due to factors like seasonal variation in energy demand and changes in global fuel prices. For example, during the winter months, the demand for electricity and heating increases, which can lead to higher utility bills.\n\nThe Afghan government has been working to improve the utility infrastructure, including the expansion of the national grid and the introduction of new energy sources like solar and wind power. However, the cost of utilities remains a significant burden for many households, especially those in rural areas where access to basic services is limited. The inflation rate in Afghanistan has been negative in recent years, which has helped to keep utility costs stable, but the overall cost of living remains high due to the country's fragile economy.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Water | $10 | $15 | $20 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $15 | $25 | $35 | |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $5 | $10 | $15 | (if separate) |\n| **Total** | **$50** | **$80** | **$110** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $20-30 | 10 Mbps | Afghan Wireless, Roshan |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $50-70 | 100 Mbps | Afghan Wireless, Roshan |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $5-10 | 1-5 GB | Afghan Wireless, Roshan, MTN |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $10-20 | 5-10 GB | Afghan Wireless, Roshan, MTN |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $30-50 | varies | Afghan Wireless, Roshan |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (if applicable) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Afghanistan, it's best to contact the local utility providers, such as the Afghan National Power Company or the Kabul Water Supply Company, and provide the necessary documentation, including a copy of your passport and a rental agreement.\n- Prepaid electricity meters are a good option for households that want to control their energy usage and avoid surprise bills.\n- Afghan Wireless and Roshan are two of the most popular internet providers in Afghanistan, offering a range of plans and packages to suit different needs and budgets.\n- To save on utility bills, households can take simple steps like using energy-efficient appliances, turning off lights and electronics when not in use, and using public transport or walking instead of driving.\n- It's also a good idea to negotiate with utility providers to get the best rates, especially for long-term contracts or bulk payments.",
