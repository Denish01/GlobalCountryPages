        <h2>Economic Overview</h2>
        <p>Afghanistan has a low-income economy, with a GDP per capita of approximately $182. The country's economic development has been hindered by decades of conflict, corruption, and lack of investment in infrastructure. Despite these challenges, Afghanistan has made significant progress in recent years, with the economy growing at an average rate of 4% per year from 2015 to 2020. However, the country still faces significant development challenges, including a large trade deficit, high unemployment, and a reliance on foreign aid. The economy is primarily driven by the services sector, which accounts for approximately 50% of GDP, followed by agriculture and mining.</p>
        <p>The country's economic classification is a low-income economy, with a Human Development Index (HDI) ranking of 168 out of 189 countries. The economy is also highly dependent on foreign aid, with international assistance accounting for approximately 40% of the country's budget. The government has implemented various reforms aimed at improving the business environment and promoting economic growth, including the establishment of a new investment law and the creation of a number of special economic zones.</p>
        <p>Despite these efforts, the economy still faces significant challenges, including a lack of infrastructure, a shortage of skilled labor, and a high level of corruption. The country is also highly vulnerable to external shocks, including changes in global commodity prices and fluctuations in international aid. To address these challenges, the government has developed a number of strategic plans, including the Afghanistan National Development Strategy, which aims to promote economic growth, reduce poverty, and improve living standards.</p>

        <h2>Economic Outlook</h2>
        <p>The Afghan economy is expected to continue growing in the coming years, driven by a combination of factors, including increased investment in infrastructure, a growing services sector, and a rise in agricultural production. However, the economy still faces significant challenges, including a high level of corruption, a lack of skilled labor, and a reliance on foreign aid. To address these challenges, the government has developed a number of strategic plans, including the Afghanistan National Development Strategy, which aims to promote economic growth, reduce poverty, and improve living standards.</p>
        <p>The government has also implemented a number of reforms aimed at improving the business environment and promoting investment, including the establishment of a new investment law and the creation of a number of special economic zones. The country is also expected to benefit from a number of major projects, including the construction of the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Tajikistan (TAT) railway and the development of the country's mineral resources. However, the economy is still highly vulnerable to external shocks, including changes in global commodity prices and fluctuations in international aid. As such, the government will need to continue to implement reforms and promote investment in order to drive economic growth and reduce poverty.</p>
