[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Afghanistan has a **territorial tax system**, which means that individuals and businesses are taxed on their income earned within the country, regardless of their residency status. However, residents are also subject to tax on their worldwide income, with credits available for taxes paid in other countries. The residency rules for tax purposes in Afghanistan are based on the individual's physical presence in the country, with individuals who spend more than 183 days in a calendar year considered residents for tax purposes.

The tax system in Afghanistan is administered by the **Ministry of Finance**, which is responsible for collecting taxes, enforcing tax laws, and providing tax guidance to taxpayers. The tax authorities in Afghanistan have been working to improve the country's tax system, including introducing new tax laws and regulations, and increasing transparency and accountability in tax administration. However, the tax system in Afghanistan is still relatively underdeveloped, and taxpayers may face challenges in navigating the system and complying with tax laws and regulations.
