  "content": "The property market in Afghanistan is largely underdeveloped and challenging for foreigners to navigate, but it is possible for them to buy property with certain restrictions and procedures. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nCan Foreigners Buy?: Restricted\nAverage Price (Capital, per sqm): $500 USD\nRental Yield: 8%\nProperty Tax: 2%\nPopular Areas: Kabul, Mazar-i-Sharif, Herat\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]\nThe Afghan property market is characterized by a lack of transparency, limited infrastructure, and a predominantly cash-based economy. The market is also heavily influenced by the country's security situation, with prices and demand fluctuating according to the level of instability. Despite these challenges, there are opportunities for investment, particularly in the major cities such as Kabul, Mazar-i-Sharif, and Herat. The urban areas tend to have more developed property markets, with a greater availability of modern amenities and services. In contrast, rural areas often lack basic infrastructure, making them less appealing to investors.\n\nThe current market conditions are marked by a slow but steady growth in demand, driven largely by the increasing number of returning refugees and internally displaced persons. The price trajectory has been upward, with prices increasing by around 10-15% per annum in recent years. However, the market is highly speculative, and prices can fluctuate rapidly in response to changes in the security situation or government policies. The lack of a formal property registry and the prevalence of informal sales agreements also contribute to the market's unpredictability.\n\nThe Afghan government has implemented various initiatives to stimulate the property market, including the creation of a new property law and the establishment of a national property registry. These efforts aim to increase transparency, reduce corruption, and attract foreign investment. However, the implementation of these reforms has been slow, and the market remains largely unregulated.\n\n[SECTION] Prices by Area [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area/City | Buy (per sqm, USD) | Rent (monthly, USD) | Type |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Kabul | 500 | 200 | Apartment |\n| Mazar-i-Sharif | 300 | 150 | House |\n| Herat | 400 | 250 | Villa |\n| Jalalabad | 250 | 100 | Apartment |\n| Kandahar | 200 | 80 | House |\n| Kunduz | 150 | 60 | Apartment |\n| Bamiyan | 100 | 40 | House |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Ownership Rules [/SECTION]\n- Foreigners can buy property in Afghanistan, but they must obtain a permit from the Ministry of Urban Development and Land, which can be a lengthy and complex process.\n- Foreign companies can also buy property, but they must be registered with the Afghan Investment Support Agency and obtain a license to operate in the country.\n- Leasehold agreements are a common workaround for foreigners, allowing them to use the property for a fixed period without formally owning it.\n- Foreigners must also comply with the Afghan government's regulations on land use and zoning, which can be restrictive and subject to change.\n- Additionally, foreigners may need to obtain a **No-Objection Certificate** from the relevant authorities, which can be a time-consuming and bureaucratic process.\n\n[SECTION] Buying Process [/SECTION]\n1.
