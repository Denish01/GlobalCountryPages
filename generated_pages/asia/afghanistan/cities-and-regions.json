The country's mountainous terrain and lack of infrastructure make it difficult to travel between provinces, and many roads are closed during the winter months due to heavy snowfall. However, efforts are being made to improve the transportation network, with new roads and airports being built. The most common mode of transportation is by bus or taxi, with many private companies operating between major cities. Driving conditions can be hazardous, especially on rural roads, and visitors are advised to exercise caution when traveling by car.\n\nDomestic flights are available between major cities, with several airlines operating regular services. However, flights can be unreliable and are often subject to cancellation due to weather conditions or security concerns.

The country's transportation network is still developing, and visitors are advised to plan carefully and exercise caution when traveling.
