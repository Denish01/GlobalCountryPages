  "content": "The primary languages spoken in Afghanistan are **Pashto** and **Dari**, with both being official languages and widely used in different regions of the country.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nOfficial Language(s): Pashto, Dari\nWidely Spoken: Uzbek, Turkmen, English\nEnglish Proficiency: Very Low\nScript: Arabic\nLanguage Family: Indo-European\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]\nThe linguistic landscape of Afghanistan is diverse, with **Pashto** being the most widely spoken language, particularly in the southern and eastern regions. **Dari**, on the other hand, is more commonly spoken in the northern and western parts of the country. Both languages are used in official contexts, including government, education, and media. Additionally, there are several minority languages spoken in Afghanistan, including **Uzbek**, **Turkmen**, and **Pashai**. While **English** is not widely spoken, it is becoming more common, particularly among the younger population and those in the tourism industry. However, English proficiency remains very low, and it is not uncommon for foreigners to encounter language barriers during their stay in Afghanistan.\n\nRegional dialects also play a significant role in Afghanistan's linguistic landscape. For example, the **Kabul dialect** of Dari is considered the standard dialect and is widely used in official contexts, while the **Herat dialect** is spoken in the western part of the country. Similarly, **Pashto** has several dialects, including the **Kandahari dialect** and the **Peshawari dialect**. These dialects can vary significantly, and it is not uncommon for speakers of one dialect to have difficulty understanding speakers of another dialect.\n\nDespite the challenges posed by language barriers, many Afghans are eager to communicate with foreigners and are often willing to use gestures and simple phrases to convey their message. In urban areas, such as **Kabul** and **Herat**, it is possible to find English speakers, particularly among the younger population and those in the tourism industry. However, in rural areas, language barriers can be more significant, and it is often necessary to rely on interpreters or translators to communicate effectively.\n\n[SECTION] Essential Phrases [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| English | Local Language | Pronunciation | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hello | Salam | SA-lam | formal |\n| Hello | Chetor hasti | CHE-tohr HA-stee | informal |\n| Thank you | Tashakor | TAH-shah-kor | formal |\n| Please | Lotfan | loh-TFAHN | formal |\n| Yes / No | Bale / Na | BA-leh / NAH | formal |\n| Excuse me | Bezah | BEH-zah | formal |\n| How much? | Cheh qadar | CHEH kah-DAHR | formal |\n| Where is...? | Koja ast... | koh-JAH AST | formal |\n| I don't understand | Man nemifahmam | MAHN neh-mee-FAH-mam | formal |\n| Do you speak English? | Ayah engilisi harf mizanid? | AH-yah ehn-gee-LEE-see hahrf mee-ZAH-nid | formal |\n| Help! | Komak! | koh-MAHK | formal |\n| Goodbye | Khodahafiz | khoh-DAH-hah-fez | formal |\n| Sorry | Bebakhshid | beh-bahk-SHEED | formal |\n| Water | Ab | AHB | formal |\n| Food | Ghaza | GHAH-zah | formal |\n| Hotel | Hotel | hoh-TEHL | formal |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Numbers & Bargaining [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Number | Local Word | Pronunciation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Yak | YAHK |\n| 2 | Do | DOH |\n| 3 | Seh | SEH |\n| 4 | Chahar | chah-HAHR |\n| 5 | Panj | PAHNJ |\n| 6 | Shash | SHAHSH |\n| 7 | Haft | HAHFT |\n| 8 | Hasht | HAHSHT |\n| 9 | Noh | NOH |\n| 10 | Dah | DAH |\n| 100 | Sad | SAHD |\n| 1000 | Hezahr | heh-ZAHR |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Communication Tips [/SECTION]\n- When interacting with Afghans, it is customary to use **formal titles** such as \"Mr.\" or \"Mrs.\" followed by the person's surname.\n- Direct eye contact is not always considered polite, particularly when interacting with older Afghans or those in positions of authority.\n- **Body language** can be an effective way to communicate, particularly when language barriers exist.\n- It is considered impolite to **point with the left hand** or to **eat with the left hand**.\n- When **bargaining**, it is customary to start with a low offer and gradually increase the price.\n- **Respect for elders** is deeply ingrained in Afghan culture, and it is customary to show deference to older individuals.\n- **Dress modestly** and avoid revealing clothing, particularly when interacting with conservative Afghans.\n- When **asking for help**, it is customary to approach someone who appears to be in a position of authority or someone who is familiar with the local area.\n\n[SECTION] Translation Tools & Resources [/SECTION]\n- The **Google Translate** app can be a useful tool for communicating with Afghans, particularly in urban areas where internet access is more widespread.\n- **Phrasebooks** can be a useful resource for learning basic phrases and vocabulary.\n- **Language learning apps** such as Duolingo can be a helpful way to learn basic Pashto and Dari phrases before traveling to Afghanistan.\n- **Local guides** can be a valuable resource for navigating the country and communicating with locals.\n- **Language exchange programs** can be a great way to practice language skills and learn more about Afghan culture.",
