The typical lease term for a rental agreement in Afghanistan is one year, with a deposit requirement of one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are limited, and disputes are often resolved through traditional mediation. Compared to its regional neighbors, Afghanistan's housing costs are relatively moderate, with prices lower than in Iran and Pakistan but higher than in some of the Central Asian countries. The housing market in Afghanistan is also influenced by the country's security situation, with prices and demand fluctuating in response to changes in the security environment.\n\nThe affordability of housing in Afghanistan is a significant challenge, particularly for low-income households. The country's **GDP per capita** is relatively low, and the **inflation rate** can be volatile, which can affect the purchasing power of households. Additionally, the **health expenditure per capita** is relatively low, which can impact the overall well-being of the population. The **out-of-pocket health spend** is also high, which can further exacerbate the affordability challenges faced by households. As a result, many Afghans rely on informal housing arrangements, such as shared accommodations or makeshift shelters.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $150-$300 | $80-$200 | basic amenities, shared kitchen and bathroom |\n| 1 Bedroom | $200-$500 | $100-$300 | furnished, with kitchen and bathroom |\n| 2 Bedroom | $300-$700 | $200-$500 | suitable for small families, with kitchen and bathroom |\n| 3 Bedroom | $500-$1,200 | $300-$800 | spacious, with kitchen, bathroom, and living area |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $1,000-$3,000 | prime locations, with access to amenities and services |\n| Suburbs | $500-$1,500 | residential areas, with limited access to amenities and services |\n| Rural | $200-$500 | basic infrastructure, limited access to amenities and services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- Wazir Akbar Khan: a secure and upscale neighborhood with rent ranges from $500-$1,500 USD per month, popular with expats and diplomats\n- Sherpur: a modern neighborhood with rent ranges from $300-$800 USD per month, known for its amenities and services\n- Taimani: a residential neighborhood with rent ranges from $200-$500 USD per month, popular with locals and expats alike\n- Karte Seh: a historic neighborhood with rent ranges from $150-$300 USD per month, known for its cultural significance and traditional architecture\n- Macroyan: a suburban neighborhood with rent ranges from $100-$250 USD per month, popular with families and those looking for a quieter lifestyle\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Afghanistan [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods thoroughly, taking into account security, amenities, and access to services\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent or property manager to find a suitable rental property\n- Negotiate the rent and terms of the lease carefully, and ensure that all agreements are in writing\n- Be prepared for variable electricity and water supply, and consider investing in a generator or water tank\n- Furnished apartments are common, but it's essential to inspect the property carefully before signing a lease\n- Be aware of scams and fraudulent activities, and never pay a deposit without verifying the property's ownership and the agent's credentials [CALLOUT] Be cautious when dealing with property transactions in Afghanistan, and seek advice from a trusted expert or authority if necessary.",
