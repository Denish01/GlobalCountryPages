  "content": "Afghanistan is generally cheaper than Pakistan, with a cost of living difference of around 20-30% in many categories.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nAfghanistan GDP per Capita (PPP): 2,024\nPakistan GDP per Capita (PPP): 5,871\nAfghanistan Inflation Rate: 5.5%\nPakistan Inflation Rate: 10.9%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Afghanistan\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Afghanistan vs Pakistan [/SECTION]\nAfghanistan and Pakistan are two neighboring countries in South Asia with distinct economic profiles. Afghanistan has a lower GDP per capita and a smaller economy, which contributes to its lower cost of living. The country's economy is largely driven by agriculture and remittances from abroad, while Pakistan has a more diversified economy with a strong services sector. The cost of living in Afghanistan is generally lower due to the country's lower economic development and lower demand for goods and services. However, the cost of living in Pakistan is also relatively low compared to other countries in the region, making it an attractive destination for expats and travelers.\n\nThe overall cost of living difference between Afghanistan and Pakistan is around 20-30% in many categories, with Afghanistan being the cheaper option. However, the cost of living can vary significantly depending on the location, with cities like Kabul and Islamabad being more expensive than smaller towns and rural areas. Additionally, the security situation in Afghanistan can also impact the cost of living, with some areas being more expensive due to the need for security measures. In contrast, Pakistan has a more stable security environment, which can make it a more attractive option for some expats and travelers.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Afghanistan (USD) | Pakistan (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 200 | 300 | 33% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 150 | 250 | 40% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 400 | 600 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Afghanistan (USD) | Pakistan (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 5 | 10 | 50% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 100 | 150 | 33% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | 10 | 15 | 33% cheaper |\n| Coffee | 2 | 3 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Afghanistan (USD) | Pakistan (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 20 | 30 | 33% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | 1 | 2 | 50% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 0.80 | 1.20 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Afghanistan (USD) | Pakistan (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 50 | 80 | 37% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 30 | 50 | 40% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | 10 | 20 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Afghanistan (USD) | Pakistan (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 400 | 600 | 33% |\n| Mid-Range | 800 | 1,200 | 33% |\n| Comfortable | 1,200 | 1,800 | 33% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Afghanistan is cheaper for:**\n- Rent and housing, with prices up to 40% lower than in Pakistan\n- Food and dining, with meal prices up to 50% lower than in Pakistan\n- Transportation, with taxi fares up to 50% lower than in Pakistan\n- Utilities and internet, with prices up to 50% lower than in Pakistan\n- **Pakistan is cheaper for:**\n- Travel and tourism, with a wider range of options and lower prices for flights and hotels\n- Education, with a more developed education system and lower tuition fees\n- Healthcare, with better-equipped hospitals and lower medical costs\n- Shopping, with a wider range of products and lower prices for clothing and electronics\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nFor expats and travelers, Afghanistan can offer a more affordable lifestyle, with lower costs for rent, food, and transportation.
