  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Afghanistan can vary significantly, with out-of-pocket expenses accounting for approximately 77.1% of total health expenditure, and the average health expenditure per capita being around $59.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $59\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 77.1%\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 119\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: AFN\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nAfghanistan's healthcare system is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, with limited resources and infrastructure, particularly in rural areas. In contrast, private healthcare providers offer higher-quality services, but at a significantly higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only affordable option, while foreigners and those who can afford it tend to opt for private healthcare. It is highly recommended to have health insurance when traveling to or living in Afghanistan, as medical evacuation to another country may be necessary in case of a serious emergency.\n\nThe healthcare system in Afghanistan faces numerous challenges, including a shortage of skilled healthcare professionals, inadequate infrastructure, and limited access to healthcare services, particularly in rural areas. Despite these challenges, there are efforts underway to improve the healthcare system, including the development of new healthcare facilities and the training of healthcare professionals. For foreigners, it is essential to research and understand the local healthcare system, including the quality of care, the cost of services, and the availability of health insurance.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $5-10 | $20-50 | Prices vary by city and doctor's qualifications |\n| Specialist Consultation | $10-20 | $50-100 | Prices vary by specialty and doctor's experience |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-20 | $30-50 | Prices vary by location and dentist's qualifications |\n| Eye Exam | $5-10 | $20-30 | Prices vary by location and optometrist's qualifications |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-20 | $30-50 | Prices vary by laboratory and test type |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $20-50 | Prices vary by hospital and severity of condition |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $50-100 | Prices vary by hospital and type of accommodation |\n| Basic Surgery | $200-500 | Prices vary by type of surgery and surgeon's experience |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $100-300 | Prices vary by hospital and type of delivery |\n| MRI Scan | $100-200 | Prices vary by hospital and type of scan |\n| X-Ray | $10-20 | Prices vary by hospital and type of X-ray |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-50 | Covers basic medical services, including doctor visits and hospital stays |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-200 | Covers a wide range of medical services, including specialist consultations and surgeries |\n| International / Expat | $200-500 | Covers medical services, including evacuations and repatriations, for foreigners living in Afghanistan |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- **Prescription medications** are available at pharmacies, but the availability of certain medications may be limited.\n- The cost of **common medications**, such as antibiotics and painkillers, can range from $5 to $20.\n- **Over-the-counter medications** are widely available at pharmacies and markets.\n- **Pharmacy availability** is generally good in urban areas, but limited in rural areas.\n- **Prescription rules** vary, but generally require a doctor's prescription for certain medications.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn case of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the local emergency number, 119, or seek immediate attention at the nearest hospital. **Ambulance services** are limited, and it may be necessary to use a taxi or private vehicle to reach a hospital.
