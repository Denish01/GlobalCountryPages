[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Afghanistan's transportation network is largely underdeveloped, with limited public transportation options available in major cities like Kabul. The quality of public transit is generally poor, with overcrowding and lack of maintenance being common issues. Most people in Afghanistan rely on private vehicles, taxis, or walking to get around, as the public transportation system is not well-established. In rural areas, donkeys, horses, and other animals are often used as a primary mode of transportation.

The main transportation modes in Afghanistan include taxis, buses, and minivans, which operate on fixed routes. However, the availability and quality of these services vary greatly depending on the city and region. In Kabul, for example, there are several bus companies that operate on fixed routes, but the buses are often overcrowded and poorly maintained. In other cities, such as Kandahar and Herat, the public transportation system is even more limited, with few options available.
