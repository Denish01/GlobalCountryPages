[SECTION] Overview: Afghanistan vs Turkmenistan [/SECTION]
Afghanistan and Turkmenistan are two neighboring countries in Central Asia with distinct economic profiles. Afghanistan has a lower GDP per capita and a smaller economy, which contributes to its lower cost of living. The country has been experiencing a period of slow economic growth, and its inflation rate is relatively stable. In contrast, Turkmenistan has a higher GDP per capita and a larger economy, driven primarily by its significant oil and gas reserves. The country has a higher inflation rate, which can impact the cost of living for expats and locals alike. Overall, Afghanistan is generally cheaper than Turkmenistan, with a difference in cost of living of around 20-30%.

The economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Afghanistan has a more informal economy, with a large proportion of the population engaged in subsistence farming or small-scale trade. This can make it difficult to find reliable and affordable goods and services, particularly in rural areas. In contrast, Turkmenistan has a more formal economy, with a greater emphasis on state-owned enterprises and a more developed infrastructure. This can make it easier to find high-quality goods and services, but also tends to drive up prices. As a result, expats and travelers may find that Afghanistan offers better value for money, particularly when it comes to accommodation and food.
