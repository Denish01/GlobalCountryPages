The quality of public transit is generally poor, with overcrowding and lack of maintenance being common issues. Most people in Afghanistan rely on private vehicles, taxis, or walking to get around, as the public transportation system is not well-established. In rural areas, donkeys, horses, and other animals are often used as a primary mode of transportation.\n\nThe main transportation modes in Afghanistan include taxis, buses, and minivans, which operate on fixed routes. However, the availability and quality of these services vary greatly depending on the city and region. In Kabul, for example, there are several bus companies that operate on fixed routes, but the buses are often overcrowded and poorly maintained. In other cities, such as Kandahar and Herat, the public transportation system is even more limited, with few options available.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.20-$0.50 | $10-$15 | Limited coverage, overcrowding |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $0.50-$1.00 | N/A | Fixed routes, variable prices |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $1.00-$2.00 | $0.50-$1.00 | $5-$10 | Negotiation common |\n| Ride-Hailing App | N/A | N/A | N/A | Limited options, e.g. **Taxi Yaar** |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $10-$20 | To city center, variable prices |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $0.80 | Variable prices depending on location |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $0.70 | Variable prices depending on location |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-$60 | Economy car, limited availability |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-$2 | Limited parking options |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $1-$5 | Limited toll roads, variable prices |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-$20 | Variable prices, limited comfort |\n| Domestic Flight | $50-$100 | Limited routes, e.g. Kabul to Herat |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider using public buses or minivans, which are often cheaper than taxis.\n- When using taxis, it's common to negotiate the fare before starting the journey.\n- Be aware of your surroundings and keep valuables secure, especially in crowded areas or public transportation.\n- Consider using reputable car rental companies if you plan to drive, as road conditions can be hazardous.\n- Download local transportation apps, such as **Taxi Yaar**, to help navigate the city and find transportation options.\n- Always wear a seatbelt and follow local traffic rules to ensure a safe journey.",
