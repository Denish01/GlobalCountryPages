  "content": "The education system in Afghanistan is a complex and evolving structure that has faced numerous challenges in recent years, but continues to provide opportunities for students to pursue their academic goals both within the country and abroad.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nLiteracy Rate: 43%\nSchool System: 12 years of compulsory education\nLanguage of Instruction: Pashto and Dari\nAcademic Calendar: 9 months\nInternational Schools: limited\nTop University Ranking: ranked among the lowest in the global ranking context\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe education system in Afghanistan is divided into three main levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Primary education, also known as **Ibtedayi**, is compulsory for all children between the ages of 7 and 12 and is free of charge. Secondary education, or **Sawond**, is also compulsory and lasts for six years, after which students can choose to pursue higher education at a university or vocational training. The quality of education in Afghanistan varies greatly depending on the region, with schools in urban areas generally having more resources and better-trained teachers than those in rural areas. Public schools are free, but often overcrowded and underfunded, while private schools offer better facilities and instruction, but at a significant cost.\n\nDespite these challenges, the Afghan government has made significant efforts to improve the education system, including increasing access to education for girls and women, who were previously excluded from schools under the Taliban regime. Today, girls make up nearly 40% of all students in Afghanistan, and the government has implemented programs to recruit and train more female teachers. However, many schools still lack basic infrastructure, such as clean water and sanitation facilities, and the country faces a significant shortage of qualified teachers.\n\nThe education system in Afghanistan is also heavily influenced by the country's cultural and religious traditions. Many schools offer **Islamic studies** as part of their curriculum, and some universities have faculties of Islamic law and theology. However, this has also led to criticism that the education system is too focused on religious studies and not enough on **science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM)** subjects, which are essential for the country's economic development.\n\n[SECTION] Top Universities [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| University | Location | Known For | Est.
