# Afghanistan Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

Afghanistan's infrastructure is underdeveloped and faces significant challenges, with a lack of investment, decades of conflict, and geographical constraints hindering the country's ability to provide basic services to its population.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 34% of population
Internet Penetration: 13%
Road Network: 21,000 km, mostly unpaved and in poor condition
Rail Network: 75 km
Major Airports: 4
Major Ports: landlocked, with no direct access to the sea
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Afghanistan's infrastructure is in a state of disrepair, with many of its roads, bridges, and buildings damaged or destroyed during decades of conflict. The country has made some progress in recent years, with investments in the energy and transportation sectors, but much work remains to be done. The urban-rural gap is significant, with cities like Kabul and Herat having access to better infrastructure, while rural areas often lack even the most basic services. The government has made efforts to improve the situation, including the development of a national infrastructure plan, but progress is slow due to funding constraints and security concerns.

The lack of infrastructure development has had a significant impact on the country's economy, with businesses often struggling to operate due to the lack of reliable electricity, transportation, and communication services. The agricultural sector, which is a significant contributor to the country's economy, is also hindered by the lack of irrigation systems, roads, and storage facilities. Despite these challenges, there are opportunities for investment and growth, particularly in the energy and mining sectors, where Afghanistan has significant potential.

Overall, Afghanistan's infrastructure requires significant investment and development to support the country's economic growth and improve the living standards of its population. The government, with the support of international donors and the private sector, needs to prioritize infrastructure development and work towards creating a more stable and secure environment that can attract investment and promote economic growth.

[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]
- The majority of Afghanistan's **power generation** comes from imported electricity, with the country relying heavily on neighboring countries for its energy needs.
- **Renewable energy** sources, such as solar and wind power, are becoming increasingly important, with several projects underway to develop the country's renewable energy potential.
- **Electricity outages** are frequent, particularly during the summer months when demand is high, and the country's aging infrastructure is unable to cope.
- The **reliability of the electricity supply** is a significant concern, with many businesses and households relying on generators and other forms of backup power.
- **Energy efficiency** is an area that requires significant improvement, with many buildings and homes lacking even basic insulation and energy-efficient appliances.

[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]
- **Tap water safety** is a concern, with many households lacking access to safe and clean drinking water, particularly in rural areas.
- **Sanitation coverage** is limited, with many households relying on traditional latrines or other forms of inadequate sanitation.
- **Water access** in rural areas is a significant challenge, with many communities lacking access to even the most basic water sources.
- **Irrigation systems** are in need of repair and development, with many farmers struggling to access the water they need to grow their crops.
- **Water conservation** is an area that requires significant attention, with the country's water resources under threat from climate change, pollution, and overuse.

[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]
- **Mobile coverage** is widespread, with several operators providing services across the country.
- **Fiber-optic connectivity** is limited, with many areas relying on satellite or other forms of connectivity.
- **4G/5G rollout** is underway, with several operators launching high-speed data services in major cities.
- **Postal services** are limited, with many areas lacking access to even the most basic postal services.
- **Internet penetration** is low, with many households lacking access to the internet, particularly in rural areas.

[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]
- The **TAPI pipeline** project, which aims to bring natural gas from Turkmenistan to India through Afghanistan and Pakistan, is a significant development project that has the potential to transform the country's energy sector.
- The **Kabul-Kandahar highway** project, which aims to upgrade the country's main highway, is a major infrastructure development project that will improve transportation links and boost economic growth.
- The **CASA-1000** project, which aims to develop a regional electricity transmission system, is a significant energy project that will increase the country's access to electricity and improve the reliability of the supply.
- The **Afghanistan-Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement** aims to improve trade links between the two countries and promote economic growth in the region.
- The **Asian Development Bank's** infrastructure development program is providing significant funding and technical assistance to support the development of Afghanistan's infrastructure, including roads, energy, and water systems.
