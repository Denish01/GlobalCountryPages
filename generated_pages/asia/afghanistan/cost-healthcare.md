[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Afghanistan's healthcare system is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, with limited resources and infrastructure, particularly in rural areas. In contrast, private healthcare providers offer higher-quality services, but at a significantly higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only affordable option, while foreigners and those who can afford it tend to opt for private healthcare. It is highly recommended to have health insurance when traveling to or living in Afghanistan, as medical evacuation to another country may be necessary in case of a serious emergency.

The healthcare system in Afghanistan faces numerous challenges, including a shortage of skilled healthcare professionals, inadequate infrastructure, and limited access to healthcare services, particularly in rural areas. Despite these challenges, there are efforts underway to improve the healthcare system, including the development of new healthcare facilities and the training of healthcare professionals. For foreigners, it is essential to research and understand the local healthcare system, including the quality of care, the cost of services, and the availability of health insurance.
