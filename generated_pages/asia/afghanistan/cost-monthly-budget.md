[SECTION] Cost of Living Overview [/SECTION]
Afghanistan is considered one of the poorer countries in the world, with a GDP per capita PPP of $2,202. However, the cost of living in Afghanistan is relatively low compared to other countries in the region. The country's low cost of living is due in part to the low cost of food, transportation, and housing. For example, a meal at a local restaurant can cost as little as $3, and a one-bedroom apartment in the city center can cost around $200-300 per month. However, the cost of living can vary greatly depending on the location, with cities like Kabul and Mazar-i-Sharif tend to be more expensive than smaller towns and rural areas.

The different budget tiers in Afghanistan can provide varying levels of comfort and amenities. A budget lifestyle of $400-700 per month can provide basic necessities like food, shelter, and transportation, but may not leave much room for entertainment or travel. A mid-range lifestyle of $700-1,200 per month can provide more comfort and amenities, such as a one-bedroom apartment in the city center, eating out at mid-range restaurants, and taking taxis or renting a car. A comfortable lifestyle of $1,200-2,000 per month can provide a high level of comfort and amenities, such as a two-bedroom apartment in a nice neighborhood, eating out at high-end restaurants, and traveling domestically or internationally.
