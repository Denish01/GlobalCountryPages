[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Turkey has a well-developed transportation network, with a variety of options available for getting around, including public transportation, taxis, ride-hailing services, and rental cars. The quality of public transit is generally good, with modern buses and metro systems in major cities like Istanbul and Ankara. Most people in Turkey get around using public transportation, with buses and minibuses being the most popular modes of transport. However, in larger cities, the metro and commuter trains are also widely used, providing a convenient and efficient way to navigate the city.

In addition to public transportation, many Turks also use taxis and ride-hailing services, which are widely available and relatively affordable. For longer distances, buses and domestic flights are popular options, with many bus companies and airlines operating throughout the country. The condition of roads in Turkey is generally good, with many highways and intercity roads being well-maintained. However, traffic in major cities can be heavy, and parking can be a challenge.
