The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of good quality, with well-equipped hospitals and skilled medical professionals. However, the quality of care can vary significantly depending on the location, with urban areas tend to have better-equipped and staffed facilities than rural areas. The private healthcare sector is also well-developed, with many high-quality hospitals and clinics, especially in major cities like Istanbul and Ankara. Overall, the quality of care in Turkey is considered to be good, with many medical facilities meeting international standards.\n\nThe Turkish healthcare system is based on a social security system, with all citizens required to have health insurance. The system is funded through a combination of government funding, employee and employer contributions, and out-of-pocket payments. Foreigners living in Turkey can also access the public healthcare system, but may need to purchase private health insurance to cover certain services. In general, the public healthcare system provides comprehensive coverage, including doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescription medications.\n\nDespite the overall quality of the healthcare system, there are some challenges, particularly in rural areas where access to medical facilities and specialized care can be limited. Additionally, the system can be bureaucratic, and wait times for certain services can be long.
