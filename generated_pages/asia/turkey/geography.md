Turkey is strategically situated at the crossroads of Europe and Asia, with a unique geography that bridges the two continents. The country is bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the south, the Aegean Sea to the west, and the Black Sea to the north, while its eastern border is shared with several countries, including Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Iran, Iraq, and Syria. To the northwest, Turkey shares a border with Greece and Bulgaria, making it an important gateway between Europe and the Middle East.

Turkey's location at the intersection of two continents has played a significant role in shaping its history, culture, and economy. The country's borders are divided into several distinct regions, each with its own unique characteristics and features. The northwestern region is characterized by a mix of European and Asian influences, while the southeastern region is more closely tied to the Middle East. The country's diverse geography and strategic location have made it an important hub for trade and cultural exchange between East and West.

Turkey's terrain is characterized by a diverse range of landscapes, including mountains, rivers, deserts, forests, and coastlines. The country is home to several major mountain ranges, including the Pontic Mountains in the north and the Taurus Mountains in the south. The highest point in Turkey is Mount Ararat, a dormant volcano located in the eastern part of the country. The country's mountainous terrain has created a number of distinct regions, each with its own unique geography and climate.

Turkey is also home to several major rivers, including the Euphrates and the Tigris, which flow through the southeastern part of the country.
