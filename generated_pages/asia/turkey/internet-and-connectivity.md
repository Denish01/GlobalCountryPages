[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in Turkey is generally of good quality, with an average download speed of 24.88 Mbps, making it suitable for streaming, online browsing, and other digital activities. However, there is a noticeable urban-rural divide in terms of internet quality, with cities like Istanbul, Ankara, and Izmir enjoying faster and more reliable connections, while rural areas may experience slower speeds and more frequent outages. The Turkish government has been investing in improving the country's internet infrastructure, including the rollout of 5G networks, which is expected to enhance the overall internet experience.

Despite the efforts to improve the internet infrastructure, Turkey's internet is not without its challenges. The country has been known to impose **internet censorship**, with some websites and online services being blocked or restricted. Additionally, the internet can be slow during peak hours, and power outages can occur, especially in rural areas. Nevertheless, the internet remains a vital part of daily life in Turkey, with many Turks relying on it for communication, entertainment, and accessing information.
