[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Turkey's healthcare system is a mix of public and private facilities, with both offering high-quality medical care. The public healthcare system is generally less expensive, but the quality of care can vary depending on the location and the specific hospital. Locals typically use the public system, while foreigners often opt for private hospitals, which offer better amenities and English-speaking staff. The system works on a universal healthcare model, where everyone is covered, but the quality of care and wait times can differ significantly between public and private facilities. It is recommended to have health insurance, especially for foreigners, as it can help cover the costs of medical care and provide access to better facilities.

The healthcare system in Turkey is well-organized, with a wide range of medical specialties and modern equipment. However, the public system can be overcrowded, and wait times can be long. Private hospitals, on the other hand, offer more personalized care and shorter wait times, but at a higher cost. For foreigners, it is essential to have health insurance that covers them in Turkey, as medical bills can be high, and some hospitals may require upfront payment. Many private hospitals have international patient departments, which cater specifically to foreigners and offer services such as translation and assistance with insurance claims.
