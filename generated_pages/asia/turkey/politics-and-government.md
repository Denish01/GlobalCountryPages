[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The Turkish government is characterized by a strong presidential system, where the **president** holds significant executive powers. The **separation of powers** is outlined in the constitution, with the legislative, executive, and judicial branches designed to provide checks and balances on each other. However, the current system has been criticized for its tendency towards **authoritarianism**, with the president holding substantial influence over the other branches. Turkey is a **unitary state**, with a centralized government and limited regional autonomy.

The Turkish political system has undergone significant changes in recent years, with the introduction of a new **presidential system** in 2018. This system replaced the previous parliamentary system, where the prime minister was the head of government. The new system has been criticized for its potential to concentrate power in the hands of the president, undermining the **separation of powers** and **democratic checks and balances**.

The Turkish constitution outlines the framework for the government and the relationship between the different branches. The **constitution** establishes Turkey as a secular, democratic, and social state, with a commitment to human rights and the rule of law. However, the current government has been accused of **eroding democratic norms** and **undermining the rule of law**, with concerns about the independence of the judiciary and the restrictions on civil liberties.
