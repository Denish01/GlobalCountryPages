Turkey has a diverse and rapidly growing economy, classified as an upper-middle-income economy by the World Bank. The country has made significant progress in recent years, with a strong focus on industrial production, services, and technology. The economy has been driven by a combination of domestic consumption, investment, and exports, with a growing middle class and an increasingly important role in regional trade. Turkey's strategic location, bridging Europe and the Middle East, has made it an important hub for trade and investment. The country's economic development has been rapid, with GDP growth averaging around 5% per year over the past decade.

Turkey's economy is driven by a mix of state-led development and private sector growth, with a strong emphasis on exports and foreign investment.
