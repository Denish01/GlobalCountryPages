Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Turkey before traveling. [/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nTurkey has a moderate visa policy, with a mix of visa-free access, e-visas, and traditional visa requirements for different nationalities. Citizens of around 90 countries can enter Turkey visa-free, while others can obtain an e-visa or a traditional visa from a Turkish embassy or consulate. The country's visa policy aims to balance security concerns with the need to promote tourism and economic development. With its rich cultural heritage and strategic location, Turkey attracts millions of visitors each year, and its visa policy is designed to facilitate travel while ensuring the safety and security of its citizens.\n\nThe Turkish government has introduced various visa facilitation measures in recent years, including the e-visa system, which allows citizens of eligible countries to obtain a visa online in a matter of minutes. This has made it easier for tourists and business travelers to visit Turkey, and has helped to boost the country's tourism industry. However, the visa requirements for certain nationalities, such as those from countries with which Turkey has limited diplomatic relations, can be more complex and time-consuming.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | Yes | eVisa | 90 days | Multiple entries allowed |\n| UK Citizens | Yes | eVisa | 90 days | Multiple entries allowed |\n| EU Citizens | No | Visa-free | 90 days | Certain EU countries have additional requirements |\n| Canadian Citizens | Yes | eVisa | 90 days | Multiple entries allowed |\n| Australian Citizens | Yes | eVisa | 90 days | Multiple entries allowed |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | eVisa | 30 days | Single entry only |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Traditional visa | 30 days | Must apply at a Turkish embassy or consulate |\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can typically stay in Turkey for up to 90 days within a 180-day period, and can apply for an e-visa or obtain a visa on arrival, depending on their nationality.

When arriving in Turkey, visitors will need to present their passport, visa (if required), and completed entry form to immigration officials.
