[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Turkey is relatively competitive, with a wide range of options available to suit different budgets and preferences. Typical lease terms are for one year, with a security deposit of one to two months' rent required. Tenants have some rights under Turkish law, including protection from eviction and the right to a written contract. Compared to its regional neighbors, Turkey's housing costs are relatively moderate, with prices comparable to those in Greece and Bulgaria, but lower than in Western European countries. However, the current **inflation rate** of 58.5% is having an impact on the housing market, with prices rising rapidly in some areas.

The Turkish government has implemented various initiatives to support the housing market, including subsidies for first-time buyers and incentives for developers to build affordable housing. However, the market can still be challenging for renters, particularly in popular cities like Istanbul and Ankara. It's essential for renters to do their research, work with a reputable agent, and carefully review their contract before signing. Additionally, renters should be aware of their rights and responsibilities under Turkish law, including the requirement to register their rental agreement with the authorities.
