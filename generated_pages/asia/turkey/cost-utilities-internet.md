[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Turkey has a well-developed utility infrastructure, with a high percentage of households having access to electricity, water, and gas. However, the cost of utilities can be fluctuating due to the country's high inflation rate, which was 58.5% in 2024. The cost of utilities also varies depending on the season, with higher costs during the winter months due to increased heating demands. Additionally, the cost of electricity is subject to change based on the government's pricing policies, which can impact the overall cost of utilities.

The quality of utility infrastructure in Turkey is generally good, with a reliable supply of electricity, water, and gas. However, there may be occasional outages or disruptions, especially during peak usage periods. The government has been investing in upgrading the utility infrastructure, including the implementation of smart grids and renewable energy sources, which is expected to improve the efficiency and reliability of the utility supply.
