  "content": "The population of Turkey is a diverse and dynamic group, with approximately 85.8 million people living in the country, comprising various ethnic, linguistic, and religious groups.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nTotal Population: 85.8 million\nPopulation Growth Rate: 1.2%\nMedian Age: 32.4 years\nUrban Population: 76.1%\nPopulation Density: 109 people per km²\nLife Expectancy: 75.6 years\nFertility Rate: 2.1 children per woman\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]\nTurkey's population is significant, both in terms of its size and growth rate. With a population growth rate of 1.2%, Turkey's population is expected to continue growing, albeit at a slower rate than in previous decades. The country's population size can be put into context by considering its geographical location, which bridges Europe and the Middle East, making it a crossroads for various cultures and civilizations. Urbanization is a dominant trend in Turkey, with approximately 76.1% of the population living in urban areas. Migration patterns in Turkey are also noteworthy, with many people moving from rural areas to cities in search of better economic opportunities. Additionally, Turkey has been a significant recipient of international migrants and refugees, particularly from neighboring countries such as Syria.\n\nThe population growth rate in Turkey has been steadily declining over the years, which can be attributed to factors such as decreased fertility rates and increased access to family planning resources. The country's population is also aging, with a median age of 32.4 years, which has implications for the workforce, healthcare, and social security systems. Furthermore, Turkey's population density is relatively high, with an average of 109 people per square kilometer, which can put pressure on resources such as housing, transportation, and infrastructure.\n\nTurkey's population is also characterized by a relatively high life expectancy, with an average of 75.6 years, which is comparable to other developed countries. The fertility rate in Turkey is approximately 2.1 children per woman, which is slightly above the replacement rate. This indicates that the population is likely to continue growing, albeit at a slow rate, in the coming years.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Turkish | 70-80% | Throughout the country | Dominant ethnic group |\n| Kurdish | 15-20% | Southeastern regions | Largest minority group |\n| Arabic | 1-2% | Southeastern regions | Significant minority group |\n| Circassian | 1-2% | Northern regions | Smaller minority group |\n| Laz | 0.5-1% | Black Sea regions | Smaller minority group |\n| Greek | 0.1-0.5% | Istanbul and Aegean regions | Minority group with historical significance |\n| Armenian | 0.1-0.5% | Istanbul and eastern regions | Minority group with historical significance |\n[/TABLE]\nTurkey is a multicultural and multi-ethnic society, with a diverse range of ethnic groups.
