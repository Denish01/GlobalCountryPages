The public healthcare system is generally less expensive, but the quality of care can vary depending on the location and the specific hospital. Locals typically use the public system, while foreigners often opt for private hospitals, which offer better amenities and English-speaking staff. The system works on a universal healthcare model, where everyone is covered, but the quality of care and wait times can differ significantly between public and private facilities. It is recommended to have health insurance, especially for foreigners, as it can help cover the costs of medical care and provide access to better facilities.\n\nThe healthcare system in Turkey is well-organized, with a wide range of medical specialties and modern equipment. However, the public system can be overcrowded, and wait times can be long. Private hospitals, on the other hand, offer more personalized care and shorter wait times, but at a higher cost. For foreigners, it is essential to have health insurance that covers them in Turkey, as medical bills can be high, and some hospitals may require upfront payment. Many private hospitals have international patient departments, which cater specifically to foreigners and offer services such as translation and assistance with insurance claims.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | |\n| Specialist Consultation | $30-$70 | $100-$200 | |\n| Dental Checkup | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | |\n| Eye Exam | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$30 | $30-$50 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$200 | |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $100-$500 | |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$2,000 | |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,000-$3,000 | |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | |\n| X-Ray | $20-$50 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, basic procedures |\n| Comprehensive Private | $150-$300 | Doctor visits, hospital stays, procedures, dental, and vision care |\n| International / Expat | $200-$500 | Worldwide coverage, including Turkey, with emergency evacuation and repatriation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medication can cost between $10 to $50 per month, depending on the type and brand.\n- Over-the-counter medication is widely available and can cost between $5 to $20.\n- Pharmacies are abundant in Turkey, with many open 24/7.\n- Some medications may require a prescription from a Turkish doctor, even if you have a prescription from your home country.\n- It is essential to have your prescription translated into Turkish to ensure you can fill it at a local pharmacy.\n- Many pharmacies offer delivery services, making it convenient to get your medication without leaving your home.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn case of a medical emergency, dial 112, the local emergency number, and ask for an ambulance.
