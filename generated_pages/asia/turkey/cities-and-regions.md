[SECTION] How Turkey Is Divided [/SECTION]
Turkey is divided into 81 provinces, each governed from a central city, and these provinces are further grouped into seven geographical regions. The administrative structure of Turkey is based on a centralized system, with the central government in Ankara having significant control over the provinces. The provinces are responsible for providing local services, such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure, while the central government handles issues like foreign policy, defense, and national economy.

The seven geographical regions of Turkey are the Marmara Region, the Black Sea Region, the Aegean Region, the Mediterranean Region, the Central Anatolia Region, the Eastern Anatolia Region, and the Southeastern Anatolia Region. Each region has its unique cultural, economic, and geographical characteristics, and they are often referred to as separate entities within the country. The regions are not administrative divisions, but rather a way to categorize the provinces based on their geographical location and cultural similarities.
