The quality of public transit is generally good, with modern buses and metro systems in major cities like Istanbul and Ankara. Most people in Turkey get around using public transportation, with buses and minibuses being the most popular modes of transport. However, in larger cities, the metro and commuter trains are also widely used, providing a convenient and efficient way to navigate the city.\n\nIn addition to public transportation, many Turks also use taxis and ride-hailing services, which are widely available and relatively affordable. For longer distances, buses and domestic flights are popular options, with many bus companies and airlines operating throughout the country. The condition of roads in Turkey is generally good, with many highways and intercity roads being well-maintained. However, traffic in major cities can be heavy, and parking can be a challenge.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.50-1.00 | $25-30 | Good coverage in major cities |\n| Metro / Subway | $0.50-1.00 | $25-30 | Available in Istanbul, Ankara, and Izmir |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $1.00-2.00 | N/A | Popular for shorter distances, routes vary by city |\n| Commuter Train | $1.00-3.00 | $50-60 | Available in Istanbul and Ankara |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $1.00-2.00 | $0.50-1.00 | $5-10 | Be sure to use the meter |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $1.00-2.00 | $0.50-1.00 | $5-10 | BiTaksi and Uber available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-50 | To city center, depending on traffic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.50-2.50 | Prices vary by location |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.20-2.20 | Prices vary by location |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-60 | Economy car, prices vary by company |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $2-5 | Prices vary by location |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $5-10 | Some highways have tolls |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-30 | Popular option for shorter distances |\n| Domestic Flight | $50-100 | Typical route, prices vary by airline |\n| Train (long-distance) | $20-50 | Available on some routes, prices vary by class |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider purchasing a monthly transit pass, which can provide unlimited travel on public transportation.\n- Use ride-hailing apps like BiTaksi and Uber, which can be more convenient and affordable than traditional taxis.\n- Be sure to negotiate the price before getting into a taxi, especially for longer distances.\n- Consider renting a car for longer distances or rural areas, where public transportation may be limited.\n- Always wear a seatbelt and follow traffic laws to ensure safety on the road.\n- Download transportation apps like Moovit or Transit to help navigate public transportation systems in major cities.",
