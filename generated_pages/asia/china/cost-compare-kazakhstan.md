[SECTION] Overview: China vs Kazakhstan [/SECTION]
China and Kazakhstan are two vastly different countries in terms of their economic context, with China being the world's second-largest economy and Kazakhstan being a major oil producer. Despite these differences, both countries offer a unique blend of traditional and modern culture, making them attractive destinations for expats, students, and retirees. In terms of cost of living, China is generally cheaper than Kazakhstan, with an overall cost of living that is around 20-30% lower. This is due to a combination of factors, including lower housing costs, food prices, and transportation costs.

The economic context of both countries also plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. China's large and diverse economy has led to a wide range of job opportunities and a relatively high standard of living, while Kazakhstan's economy is more reliant on oil exports, which can make it more vulnerable to fluctuations in global oil prices. However, Kazakhstan's economy has been growing rapidly in recent years, driven by investments in infrastructure and industry, which has led to an increase in the cost of living. Overall, China's lower cost of living and more diverse economy make it a more attractive option for those looking to relocate.
