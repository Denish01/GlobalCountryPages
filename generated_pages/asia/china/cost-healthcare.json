The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to private hospitals, which often have better facilities and more experienced doctors. For locals, the healthcare system is often subsidized by the government, with many citizens having access to basic medical care. However, for foreigners, it is highly recommended to have health insurance, as the cost of medical care can be high, and many hospitals may not accept foreign insurance plans. In addition, the quality of care can vary significantly depending on the location, with major cities like Beijing and Shanghai generally having better-equipped hospitals and more experienced medical staff.\n\nThe healthcare system in China is also characterized by a significant disparity between urban and rural areas. In urban areas, there are often more private hospitals and clinics, which can provide high-quality care, but at a higher cost. In rural areas, the public healthcare system is often the only option, and the quality of care can be lower. For foreigners, it is often recommended to seek medical care in major cities, where there are more international-standard hospitals and medical facilities. Many hospitals in China also have international departments, which cater specifically to foreigners and offer higher-quality care, often with English-speaking staff.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | Prices vary by city and hospital |\n| Specialist Consultation | $20-$50 | $100-$200 | Prices vary by specialty and hospital |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | Prices vary by city and dental clinic |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | Prices vary by city and optometrist |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | Prices vary by hospital and lab |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$200 | Prices vary by hospital and city |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $100-$500 | Prices vary by hospital and city |\n| Basic Surgery | $1,000-$5,000 | Prices vary by procedure and hospital |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,500-$5,000 | Prices vary by hospital and city |\n| MRI Scan | $100-$500 | Prices vary by hospital and city |\n| X-Ray | $10-$50 | Prices vary by hospital and city |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Basic medical care, hospital stays, and surgeries |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-$300 | High-quality medical care, international-standard hospitals, and specialist consultations |\n| International / Expat | $200-$500 | Global coverage, including medical evacuation and repatriation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medication can cost between $5-$20 per month, depending on the type and brand\n- Over-the-counter medication is widely available, with prices starting from $1-$5\n- Pharmacies are common in urban areas, but may be less accessible in rural areas\n- Prescription rules vary, but generally require a doctor's prescription for certain medications\n- Common medications like painkillers and antibiotics are widely available, but may require a prescription\n- Some medications may be counterfeit or of poor quality, so it's essential to purchase from reputable pharmacies\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it's essential to call the local emergency number, 120, which will dispatch an ambulance to your location.
