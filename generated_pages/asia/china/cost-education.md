[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in China is highly competitive and emphasizes standardized testing and rote memorization. Public education is generally of high quality, but the quality can vary significantly depending on the location and funding. Private schools, on the other hand, offer more flexible and innovative approaches to education, but can be expensive. The language of instruction is primarily **Mandarin**, but some international schools offer instruction in other languages. Compulsory education in China lasts for 9 years, from age 6 to 15. International schools are available in major cities, offering a range of curricula, including **International Baccalaureate (IB)**, **Advanced Placement (AP)**, and **Cambridge International Examinations (CIE)**.

The Chinese government has implemented various reforms to improve the education system, including increasing funding for public schools and promoting **vocational education**. However, the education system still faces challenges, such as overcrowding and a shortage of qualified teachers. Despite these challenges, China has made significant progress in increasing access to education, with over 90% of children now attending school. The country has also become a popular destination for international students, with many universities offering programs taught in English.
