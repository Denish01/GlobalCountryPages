The provinces are the primary administrative divisions, and they are further divided into prefectures, counties, and townships. The autonomous regions are granted a degree of autonomy to manage their own affairs, and they are typically inhabited by ethnic minority groups. The municipalities are directly under the central government and are typically major cities with significant economic and cultural importance. The special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau have a high degree of autonomy and are governed under the \"one country, two systems\" principle.\n\nThe administrative structure of China is designed to balance the needs of the central government with the needs of the local populations. The provinces and autonomous regions have a significant degree of autonomy to manage their own affairs, but they are still subject to the authority of the central government. This structure has allowed China to maintain its territorial integrity and promote economic development, while also allowing for a degree of regional diversity and autonomy.\n\n[SECTION] Major Cities [/SECTION]\n**Shanghai** (24.1 million)\nRole: Economic hub, port city\nKnown For: Shanghai is known for its stunning skyline, vibrant nightlife, and world-class shopping.

The country has a vast network of highways, railways, and airports, making it easy to get around. The high-speed rail network is particularly extensive, with trains connecting many of the major cities. Domestic flights are also widely available, with many airlines operating within the country. Buses are a popular mode of transportation, especially for shorter distances, and driving is also an option, although the roads can be chaotic and crowded.\n\nFor travelers, the best way to get around China depends on the distance and the mode of transportation. For long distances, flying or taking the high-speed train is usually the best option. For shorter distances, buses or driving may be more convenient. It's also worth noting that many cities have their own public transportation systems, including subways, buses, and taxis, making it easy to get around without a car. [CALLOUT] Be sure to research and plan ahead, as transportation options can be limited in some areas, especially in rural regions.",
