# China Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

China's infrastructure is highly developed, with a vast network of roads, railways, airports, and ports, as well as a growing energy and telecommunications sector, although there is still a significant urban-rural gap in terms of access to these services.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 100% of population
Internet Penetration: 61%
Road Network: 4,770,000 km, with a high-speed highway system
Rail Network: 131,000 km
Major Airports: 230
Major Ports: 34
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
China has made significant investments in its infrastructure in recent years, with a focus on developing its transportation network, energy sector, and telecommunications industry. The country's infrastructure development level is generally high, with modern roads, railways, and airports, as well as a well-developed energy and telecommunications sector. However, there is still a significant gap between urban and rural areas, with many rural communities lacking access to basic infrastructure such as paved roads, reliable electricity, and clean water. The government has launched several initiatives to address this gap, including the **Belt and Road Initiative**, which aims to promote economic development and infrastructure construction in rural areas.

China's infrastructure development has been driven by the government's **Five-Year Plans**, which have set out ambitious targets for infrastructure investment and development. The country has also attracted significant foreign investment in its infrastructure sector, particularly in the energy and telecommunications industries. Despite these efforts, China still faces significant challenges in terms of infrastructure development, including a lack of funding, corruption, and environmental concerns.

The Chinese government has also launched several initiatives to promote **sustainable infrastructure development**, including the use of renewable energy sources, green buildings, and environmentally friendly transportation systems. These initiatives aim to reduce the country's carbon footprint and promote more sustainable economic development.
