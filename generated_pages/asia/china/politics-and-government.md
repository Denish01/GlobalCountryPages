[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of China is based on a **socialist system**, with the CPC as the sole ruling party. The **National People's Congress (NPC)** is the highest organ of state power, responsible for electing the president, premier, and other top officials. The **State Council**, headed by the premier, is the chief administrative authority, overseeing the implementation of national policies. The **Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)** is a key advisory body, comprising representatives from various social and economic sectors. The system is characterized by a **unitary structure**, with the central government holding significant authority over the provinces and municipalities.

The Chinese government operates on the principle of **democratic centralism**, where decisions are made through a centralized process, but with input from various stakeholders. The **separation of powers** is not strictly observed, as the CPC plays a dominant role in all branches of government. The **legislative**, **executive**, and **judicial** branches are interconnected, with the CPC exercising control over key appointments and decision-making processes.

The government has implemented various measures to increase **transparency** and **accountability**, such as the introduction of **open government information** and **anti-corruption campaigns**.
