[SECTION] Overview: China vs Pakistan [/SECTION]
China and Pakistan are two vastly different countries in terms of their economies, cultures, and standards of living. China is a global economic powerhouse with a high GDP per capita, while Pakistan is a developing country with a lower GDP per capita. As a result, the cost of living in China is generally higher than in Pakistan, especially in major cities like Beijing and Shanghai. However, the cost of living in Pakistan can vary greatly depending on the location, with larger cities like Karachi and Lahore tend to be more expensive than smaller towns and rural areas.
