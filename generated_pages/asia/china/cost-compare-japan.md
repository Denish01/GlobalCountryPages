[SECTION] Overview: China vs Japan [/SECTION]
China and Japan are two of the most populous and economically powerful countries in Asia, with distinct cultural and economic profiles. While Japan is known for its high standard of living and cutting-edge technology, China has undergone rapid economic growth and urbanization in recent decades, resulting in a significant gap in the cost of living between the two countries. On average, China is around 30-40% cheaper than Japan, making it an attractive destination for expats, students, and tourists looking for affordable options.

The economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. China has a large and growing middle class, with a rapidly expanding consumer market, while Japan has an aging population and a more mature economy. As a result, China has a more competitive and dynamic market, with lower prices for many goods and services. However, Japan is known for its high quality of life, excellent infrastructure, and world-class amenities, making it a desirable destination for those willing to pay a premium.
