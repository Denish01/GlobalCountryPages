Public education is generally of high quality, but the quality can vary significantly depending on the location and funding. Private schools, on the other hand, offer more flexible and innovative approaches to education, but can be expensive. The language of instruction is primarily **Mandarin**, but some international schools offer instruction in other languages. Compulsory education in China lasts for 9 years, from age 6 to 15. International schools are available in major cities, offering a range of curricula, including **International Baccalaureate (IB)**, **Advanced Placement (AP)**, and **Cambridge International Examinations (CIE)**.\n\nThe Chinese government has implemented various reforms to improve the education system, including increasing funding for public schools and promoting **vocational education**. However, the education system still faces challenges, such as overcrowding and a shortage of qualified teachers. Despite these challenges, China has made significant progress in increasing access to education, with over 90% of children now attending school. The country has also become a popular destination for international students, with many universities offering programs taught in English.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0-$100 | Free or subsidized, high quality |\n| Private Primary | $2,000-$5,000 | Range by tier, varying quality |\n| Public Secondary | $0-$200 | Free or subsidized, high quality |\n| Private Secondary | $3,000-$8,000 | Range by tier, varying quality |\n| International School | $8,000-$20,000 | Curriculum types: IB, AP, CIE |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $1,000-$3,000 | $2,000-$5,000 | Varying quality |\n| Private University | $3,000-$6,000 | $5,000-$10,000 | Varying quality |\n| Top-Ranked University | $5,000-$10,000 | $10,000-$20,000 | **Tsinghua University**, **Peking University** |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $200-$500 | Varying quality |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $20-$50 | Popular for exam preparation |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $100-$300 | **Mandarin**, **English** |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $50-$100 | Varying quality |\n| School Uniform | $20-$50 | Required for most schools |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The best schools for expats in China are often international schools, which offer a range of curricula and instruction in languages other than **Mandarin**.\n- Scholarship availability is limited, but some universities offer scholarships to international students.\n- Online learning options are becoming increasingly popular in China, with many universities offering online courses and degree programs.\n- Education quality in China is generally high, but can vary significantly depending on the location and type of institution.\n- **Gaokao**, the national college entrance exam, is highly competitive and plays a significant role in determining university placement.\n- Expats and international students should research thoroughly and plan carefully to navigate the complex and competitive education system in China.",
