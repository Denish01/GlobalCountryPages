[SECTION] Overview: China vs Vietnam [/SECTION]
China and Vietnam are two neighboring countries in Asia with distinct economic profiles. China is the world's second-largest economy, with a GDP per capita of over $24,000, while Vietnam's GDP per capita is around $8,000. Despite the significant difference in economic size, both countries have experienced rapid growth and urbanization in recent years, leading to an increase in the cost of living. However, Vietnam remains generally cheaper than China, with a lower cost of living index. The main reason for this difference is the lower cost of rent, food, and transportation in Vietnam.

The economic context of the two countries also plays a role in their cost of living. China is a more developed economy with a larger middle class, which has driven up prices for goods and services. In contrast, Vietnam is still a developing economy with a lower cost of labor and production, which keeps prices lower. Additionally, the Chinese government has implemented various policies to control inflation and stabilize the economy, which has contributed to the higher cost of living. In Vietnam, the government has also implemented measures to control inflation, but the overall cost of living remains lower.
