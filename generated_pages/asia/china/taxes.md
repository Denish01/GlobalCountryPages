[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
China has a **territorial taxation system**, which means that tax is levied on income derived from sources within China, regardless of the taxpayer's residence status. However, for **worldwide taxation**, China taxes its residents on their global income, with credits available for taxes paid in other countries. Residency rules for tax purposes in China are based on the **183-day rule**, where an individual is considered a tax resident if they stay in China for 183 days or more in a calendar year.

The tax system in China is complex and has undergone significant reforms in recent years. The government has introduced various tax incentives to attract foreign investment and encourage economic growth. Taxpayers in China are required to register with the tax authorities and obtain a tax identification number. The tax year in China runs from January to December, and taxpayers are required to file their tax returns and pay any tax due by the end of May following the tax year.
