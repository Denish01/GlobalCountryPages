# China Visa & Entry Requirements

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of China before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
China has a moderate visa policy, with a mix of visa-free access, visa on arrival, and required visas for different nationalities. Currently, citizens of 14 countries, including Japan, Singapore, and Brunei, can enter China visa-free for a limited period. Additionally, China offers visa-free transit for 72 or 144 hours in certain cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, for citizens of over 50 countries. However, for most nationalities, a visa is required before entering the country.

China's visa policy aims to balance tourism, business, and security concerns. The country has been gradually opening up to international travelers, with the introduction of new visa types, such as the **eVisa** and **visa on arrival**, to make it easier for visitors to enter. However, the visa application process can be complex, and requirements may vary depending on the nationality and purpose of the visit.
