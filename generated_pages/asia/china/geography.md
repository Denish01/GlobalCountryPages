[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
China is located in East Asia, bordered by 14 countries, including Russia, Mongolia, North Korea, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar, India, Bhutan, Nepal, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan. The country is surrounded by several major bodies of water, including the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Yellow Sea to the northeast, and the South China Sea to the southeast. China's coastline stretches for over 14,000 kilometers, with many major ports and coastal cities, such as Shanghai and Guangzhou.

China's location has played a significant role in shaping its history, culture, and economy. The country's vast borders have led to a diverse range of cultural and economic exchanges with its neighboring countries, while its coastline has facilitated trade and communication with other parts of the world. China's strategic location has also made it an important player in regional and global politics. The country's borders are marked by several major mountain ranges, including the Himalayas to the south and the Tian Shan to the west, which have helped to shape its climate, geography, and cultural identity.
