[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
China's population is massive, accounting for approximately 18% of the world's total population. The country has experienced rapid population growth over the past century, driven by improvements in healthcare, sanitation, and living standards. However, the population growth rate has slowed in recent years due to factors such as the one-child policy, which was implemented in 1979 and relaxed in 2016. Urbanization has also played a significant role in shaping China's demographic landscape, with millions of people migrating from rural areas to cities in search of better job opportunities and living standards. Today, China is home to some of the world's most populous cities, including Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangzhou.

The population of China is expected to continue growing, albeit at a slower rate, and is projected to peak at around 1.44 billion by 2029. The country is also experiencing significant changes in its age structure, with a rapidly aging population and a declining proportion of working-age individuals. This demographic shift is expected to have significant implications for China's economy, healthcare system, and social security programs. Furthermore, China's population is becoming increasingly urbanized, with the urban population projected to reach 70% of the total population by 2030.

China's population growth has also been influenced by migration patterns, both within the country and across its borders. The country has a large diaspora community, with millions of Chinese people living abroad, particularly in the United States, Canada, and Australia. Additionally, China has become a popular destination for international migrants, with many people moving to the country for work, study, or business opportunities.
