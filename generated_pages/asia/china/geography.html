        <h2>Location & Borders</h2>
        <p>China is located in East Asia, bordered by 14 countries, including Russia, Mongolia, North Korea, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar, India, Bhutan, Nepal, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan. The country is surrounded by several major bodies of water, including the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Yellow Sea to the northeast, and the South China Sea to the southeast. China's coastline stretches for over 14,000 kilometers, with many major ports and coastal cities, such as Shanghai and Guangzhou.</p>
        <p>China's location has played a significant role in shaping its history, culture, and economy. The country's vast borders have led to a diverse range of cultural and economic exchanges with its neighboring countries, while its coastline has facilitated trade and communication with other parts of the world. China's strategic location has also made it an important player in regional and global politics. The country's borders are marked by several major mountain ranges, including the Himalayas to the south and the Tian Shan to the west, which have helped to shape its climate, geography, and cultural identity.</p>
        <h2>Terrain & Landscape</h2>
        <p>China's terrain is incredibly diverse, with a range of mountains, rivers, deserts, forests, and coastlines. The country is home to some of the world's most famous mountain ranges, including the <strong>Himalayas</strong>, the <strong>Tian Shan</strong>, and the <strong>Kunlun Mountains</strong>. The Himalayas, which stretch across southern China, are home to some of the world's highest peaks, including <strong>Mount Everest</strong>, which stands at 8,848 meters. The country's mountainous regions are also home to many of its most famous rivers, including the <strong>Yangtze River</strong> and the <strong>Yellow River</strong>, which have played a crucial role in shaping China's history and culture.</p>
        <p>China's landscape is also marked by several major deserts, including the <strong>Gobi Desert</strong> and the <strong>Taklamakan Desert</strong>, which cover much of the country's northwestern regions. These deserts are known for their harsh climate and limited vegetation, but they are also home to several important cities and trade routes. China's forests, which cover around 20% of the country, are also an important feature of its landscape, with many of its most famous forests, such as the <strong>Sichuan Forest</strong>, being home to a wide range of plant and animal species.</p>
        <p>In addition to its mountains, rivers, and deserts, China's coastline is also an important feature of its landscape. The country's coastal regions are home to many of its most important cities, including <strong>Shanghai</strong> and <strong>Guangzhou</strong>, and are a major hub for trade and commerce. China's coastline is also known for its natural beauty, with many of its most famous beaches and islands, such as <strong>Hainan Island</strong>, being popular tourist destinations.</p>
