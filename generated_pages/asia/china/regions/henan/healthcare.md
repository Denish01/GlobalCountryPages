The healthcare system in Henan is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering a range of medical services. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of good quality, with well-equipped hospitals and clinics, especially in urban areas such as Zhengzhou, the capital city of Henan. However, the quality of care can vary significantly in rural areas, where medical facilities and personnel may be limited. The private healthcare sector is also well-developed, with many high-quality hospitals and clinics catering to the needs of affluent locals and foreigners. Overall, the quality of healthcare in Henan is considered to be good, with a rating of 3/5, although there is room for improvement, especially in rural areas.

The structure of the healthcare system in Henan is similar to that of the rest of China, with a strong emphasis on preventive care and public health programs. The government has implemented various initiatives to improve healthcare access and quality, including the expansion of health insurance coverage and the development of community health centers. Despite these efforts, there are still significant disparities in healthcare access and outcomes between urban and rural areas, with rural areas generally having poorer health indicators and less access to medical care.

In terms of access to healthcare, urban areas such as Zhengzhou and Luoyang have a wide range of medical facilities and services available, including high-quality hospitals, clinics, and specialty care centers. In contrast, rural areas may have limited access to medical care, with fewer hospitals and clinics, and less specialized care available.
