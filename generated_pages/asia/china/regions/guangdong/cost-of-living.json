[/SECTION]\nGuangdong, a region in southern China, has a cost of living that is relatively moderate compared to other major cities in Asia. The region's economy is driven by manufacturing, trade, and tourism, which has led to a significant increase in living costs over the years. However, compared to neighboring cities like Hong Kong and Macau, Guangdong is still relatively affordable. The cost of living in Guangdong is influenced by factors such as location, lifestyle, and personal preferences, with cities like Guangzhou and Shenzhen tend to be more expensive than smaller towns and rural areas.\n\nIn terms of global averages, Guangdong's cost of living is slightly lower than that of many Western countries, but higher than that of many other Asian cities.
