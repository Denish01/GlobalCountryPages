The region is generally considered to be very safe, with low rates of violent crime and petty theft. However, as with any popular tourist destination, there are still some risks and scams that visitors should be aware of. The region's major cities, such as Guangzhou and Shenzhen, are well-policed and have a strong security presence, which helps to maintain order and prevent crime.\n\nDespite the overall safety of the region, there are some areas that visitors should exercise caution in.
