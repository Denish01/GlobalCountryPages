  "content": "Healthcare in Guangdong is a mixed system that combines public and private providers, offering a range of options for patients, although the quality of care can vary significantly between urban and rural areas.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nQuality Rating: Good\nEmergency Number: 120\nHospital Standard: Good\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: widespread\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nThe healthcare system in Guangdong is structured into three tiers, with primary care provided by community health centers and clinics, secondary care offered by general hospitals, and tertiary care available at specialized hospitals. Public healthcare providers are generally less expensive than private ones, but may have longer waiting times and less advanced equipment. The quality of care in urban areas, such as Guangzhou and Shenzhen, is generally higher than in rural areas, where facilities and personnel may be limited. Despite these challenges, Guangdong has made significant progress in recent years in improving its healthcare infrastructure and services.\n\nThe public healthcare system in Guangdong is primarily funded by the government, with some contributions from patients and employers. Private healthcare providers, on the other hand, are largely funded by out-of-pocket payments and private insurance. The mix of public and private providers offers patients a range of options, but can also create disparities in access to care, particularly for those who cannot afford private services.\n\nOverall, the healthcare system in Guangdong is well-developed, with a wide range of services and specialties available, particularly in urban areas. However, there are still challenges to be addressed, including unequal access to care, varying quality of services, and limited availability of certain specialized treatments.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals &
