The administrative structure is designed to balance the needs of the local population with the requirements of the Chinese government. The divisions are based on geographical and cultural factors, with each prefecture having its own unique character and identity. For example, the Ngari Prefecture is known for its high-altitude lakes and mountains, while the Shannan Prefecture is home to many ancient monasteries and temples.\n\nThe divisions are also responsible for managing the local economy, education, and healthcare systems. The Tibetan government-in-exile, which is based in Dharamsala, India, also claims to represent the interests of the Tibetan people, although its authority is not recognized by the Chinese government. The complex administrative structure of Tibet reflects the region's complex history and cultural identity.\n\n[SECTION] Major Cities [/SECTION]\n**Lhasa** (population over 590,000)\nRole: capital and cultural center\nKnown For: its stunning Potala Palace and Jokhang Temple, which are UNESCO World Heritage sites\nBest For: visitors interested in Tibetan culture and history\n**Shigatse** (population over 120,000)\nRole: economic hub and transportation center\nKnown For: its Tashilhunpo Monastery, which is one of the largest functioning Buddhist monasteries in Tibet\nBest For: travelers looking to explore the surrounding countryside and visit nearby monasteries\n**Nagqu** (population over 40,000)\nRole: administrative center and transportation hub\nKnown For: its high-altitude grasslands and nomadic culture\nBest For: adventure seekers and nature lovers\n**Nyingchi** (population over 30,000)\nRole: tourist center and cultural hub\nKnown For: its stunning natural beauty, including the nearby Namcha Barwa mountain\nBest For: visitors looking to explore the region's natural wonders\n**Qamdo** (population over 110,000)\nRole: economic center and transportation hub\nKnown For: its rich cultural heritage and stunning natural beauty\nBest For: travelers looking to explore the region's history and culture\n\n[SECTION] Key Regions [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Region | Character | Known For | Major City |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Ngari Prefecture | high-altitude and rugged | Mount Kailash and Lake Manasarovar | Shiquanhe |\n| Nagqu Prefecture | nomadic and rural | high-altitude grasslands and nomadic culture | Nagqu |\n| Chamdo Prefecture | cultural and historical | ancient monasteries and temples | Chamdo |\n| Shannan Prefecture | agricultural and rural | fertile valleys and ancient monasteries | Nêdong |\n| Lhasa Prefecture | urban and cultural | Potala Palace and Jokhang Temple | Lhasa |\n| Nyingchi Prefecture | natural and scenic | stunning natural beauty and outdoor activities | Nyingchi |\n| Shigatse Prefecture | economic and cultural | Tashilhunpo Monastery and surrounding countryside | Shigatse |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Differences [/SECTION]\n- The regions of Tibet differ significantly in terms of culture, with the eastern regions being more influenced by Chinese culture and the western regions being more traditional and nomadic.\n- The economy of Tibet also varies by region, with the Lhasa Prefecture being the most developed and the Nagqu Prefecture being more rural and nomadic.\n- The climate of Tibet ranges from tropical to alpine, with the southern regions being warmer and more humid than the northern regions.\n- The language spoken in Tibet also varies by region, with Tibetan being the primary language spoken in the western regions and Chinese being more widely spoken in the eastern regions.\n\n[SECTION] Getting Around [/SECTION]\nTibet has a well-developed transportation network, with several domestic flights connecting the major cities. The region is also connected to the rest of China by a network of highways and railways, including the Qinghai-Tibet Railway, which runs from Xining to Lhasa. Buses and taxis are also widely available, although the roads can be rough and winding, especially in the rural areas. The best way to get around Tibet is by hiring a private car and driver, or by joining a guided tour. The high altitude of Tibet can also be a challenge for travelers, and it is recommended to acclimate to the altitude gradually by spending a few days in Lhasa or other lower-altitude areas before traveling to the higher-altitude regions.\n\nThe transportation network in Tibet is constantly improving, with new roads and railways being built to connect the region to the rest of China. However, the high altitude and rugged terrain of Tibet can still pose challenges for travelers, and it is essential to plan carefully and research the best routes and modes of transportation before embarking on a trip to the region. Additionally, the Chinese government has implemented various regulations and restrictions on travel to Tibet, including requirements for guided tours and permits for certain areas, so it is essential to check the latest travel requirements before planning a trip to the region.",
