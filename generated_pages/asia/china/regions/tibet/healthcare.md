[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Tibet's healthcare system is a complex mix of traditional and modern medicine, with a strong emphasis on **preventive care**. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality, with limited resources and outdated facilities, especially in rural areas. In contrast, private hospitals and clinics, often catering to tourists and expatriates, offer higher standards of care, but at a significantly higher cost. The quality of care in urban areas, such as Lhasa, is generally better than in rural areas, where access to medical facilities and specialized care can be limited.

The Tibetan government has implemented various initiatives to improve healthcare services, including the introduction of **telemedicine** to connect rural patients with urban specialists. However, the healthcare system still faces significant challenges, including a shortage of trained medical professionals, inadequate infrastructure, and limited access to specialized care. Despite these challenges, Tibet has made significant progress in reducing **mortality rates** and improving **life expectancy** in recent years.

The healthcare system in Tibet is also influenced by the country's unique cultural and geographical context. **Traditional Tibetan medicine**, which emphasizes holistic and natural approaches to health, is still widely practiced and respected. However, the use of traditional medicine can sometimes conflict with modern medical practices, highlighting the need for a more integrated approach to healthcare in Tibet.
