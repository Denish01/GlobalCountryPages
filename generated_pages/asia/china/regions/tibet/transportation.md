[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Tibet can be reached by air, with the main international airport being Lhasa Gonggar Airport (LXA), which is located about 45 miles southwest of Lhasa, the capital city. There are direct flights to Lhasa from major Chinese cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Chengdu, as well as from other international destinations like Kathmandu, Nepal. Overland entry points to Tibet include the border crossings with Nepal, India, and Bhutan, although these routes can be challenging and require special permits.

For travelers who prefer to enter Tibet by land, there are several overland routes to choose from, including the Qinghai-Tibet Highway, the Sichuan-Tibet Highway, and the Xinjiang-Tibet Highway. These routes offer breathtaking scenery and a chance to experience the unique culture of the Tibetan Plateau. However, overland travel can be challenging due to the high altitude and unpredictable weather conditions, and travelers should be well-prepared and physically fit before embarking on such a journey.

Tibet has an extensive domestic air network, with flights connecting Lhasa to other major cities in the region, such as Shigatse, Nyingchi, and Qamdo. Domestic airlines such as China Eastern, China Southern, and Tibet Airlines operate flights to and from Lhasa, with frequent departures throughout the day. Booking domestic flights in advance is recommended, especially during peak travel seasons, as prices can be high and availability limited. Approximate costs for domestic flights in Tibet range from $100 to $300 USD per person, depending on the route and airline.

The train journey from Xining to Lhasa takes around 24 hours, depending on the type of train and the number of stops. Booking train tickets in advance is recommended, especially during peak travel seasons, as availability can be limited. The booking process can be done online or through a travel agency, and prices range from $100 to $500 USD per person, depending on the class of service and the route.

Bus travel can be a more affordable option than flying or taking the train, with prices ranging from $10 to $50 USD per person, depending on the route and the type of bus.
