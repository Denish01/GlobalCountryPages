To the south, Tibet is bordered by Nepal, India, and Bhutan, while to the east, it is bordered by the Chinese provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan. To the north, Tibet is bordered by the Chinese provinces of Xinjiang and Qinghai, and to the southeast, it is bordered by the Chinese province of Gansu and Myanmar. The region is landlocked, with no direct access to the ocean, and is characterized by its unique cultural and geographical landscape.\n\nThe location of Tibet has played a significant role in shaping its history, culture, and economy. The region's strategic position has made it an important center for trade and cultural exchange between India, China, and other neighboring countries. The **Himalayan mountain range**, which runs along the southern border of Tibet, has also had a significant impact on the region's climate and ecosystem. The range creates a rain shadow effect, resulting in a dry and arid climate in the north, while the southern parts of Tibet receive more rainfall and have a more temperate climate.\n\n[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]\nTibet is characterized by its unique and diverse landscape, which includes **mountains**, **rivers**, **lakes**, and **plateaus**. The region is home to some of the highest mountains in the world, including **Mount Everest**, which is the highest point on Earth. The **Himalayan mountain range** runs along the southern border of Tibet, while the **Kunlun Mountains** and the **Tanggula Mountains** run along the northern border. The region is also home to several major rivers, including the **Yarlung Tsangpo River**, which is the highest major river in the world and flows through the **Yarlung Tsangpo Grand Canyon**, one of the deepest and longest canyons in the world.\n\nThe landscape of Tibet is also characterized by its high-altitude **plateaus**, which are often referred to as the \"Roof of the World\". The **Tibetan Plateau**, which covers most of the region, has an average elevation of over 4,500 meters and is home to several major **lakes**, including **Lake Namtso** and **Lake Manasarovar**. The region's unique landscape and climate have also resulted in the formation of several **deserts**, including the **Qiangtang Desert** and the **Changtang Desert**. The **Changtang Desert**, which covers a significant part of northern Tibet, is known for its unique wildlife, including the **Tibetan antelope** and the **snow leopard**.\n\nThe terrain and landscape of Tibet have played a significant role in shaping the region's ecosystem and biodiversity. The region is home to several unique and endangered species, including the **snow leopard**, the **Tibetan antelope**, and the **black-necked crane**. The region's high-altitude **wetlands**, which include several major **lakes** and **rivers**, are also an important habitat for several migratory bird species. The **Tibetan Plateau** is also home to several major **geothermal** areas, including the **Yangbajain Geothermal Field**, which is one of the largest geothermal fields in the world.\n\n[SECTION] Climate By Season [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Season | Months | Temperature Range | Rainfall | Conditions |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Spring | March to May | 10-20°C | moderate | mild temperatures, occasional rain |\n| Summer | June to August | 15-25°C | high | warm temperatures, heavy rainfall |\n| Autumn | September to November | 5-15°C | low | cool temperatures, clear skies |\n| Winter | December to February | -10 to 0°C | low | cold temperatures, snowfall |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Time To Visit [/SECTION]\n[CALLOUT] Best months: May to October.
