[SECTION] Food Culture Overview [/SECTION]
Tibetan cuisine is defined by its hearty and simple dishes, which are often made with locally sourced ingredients such as **tsampa**, **yak meat**, and **mutton**. The country's unique cultural heritage, which is influenced by Buddhism and its geographical location in the Himalayas, has also shaped the local cuisine. Tibetan food is often served with a side of **tsampa**, which is used to make a variety of dishes, including **tsampa porridge** and **tsampa tea**. The cuisine is also influenced by neighboring countries, such as China, India, and Nepal, which has introduced new ingredients and cooking techniques.

Regional variations in Tibetan cuisine are also notable, with different regions having their own unique dishes and specialties. For example, the **Lhasa** region is known for its **Momo**, while the **Shigatse** region is famous for its **Thukpa**. The **Nyingchi** region, which is located in the southeastern part of Tibet, is known for its **Laphing**, a spicy noodle dish made with **yak meat** and **vegetables**.

Tibetan cuisine is also closely tied to the country's cultural and religious practices. For example, **tsampa** is an important ingredient in many Tibetan dishes, and is often used as an offering to the gods. The preparation and consumption of food is also often accompanied by rituals and ceremonies, which are an important part of Tibetan culture.
