The country's unique cultural heritage, which is influenced by Buddhism and its geographical location in the Himalayas, has also shaped the local cuisine. Tibetan food is often served with a side of **tsampa**, which is used to make a variety of dishes, including **tsampa porridge** and **tsampa tea**. The cuisine is also influenced by neighboring countries, such as China, India, and Nepal, which has introduced new ingredients and cooking techniques.\n\nRegional variations in Tibetan cuisine are also notable, with different regions having their own unique dishes and specialties. For example, the **Lhasa** region is known for its **Momo**, while the **Shigatse** region is famous for its **Thukpa**. The **Nyingchi** region, which is located in the southeastern part of Tibet, is known for its **Laphing**, a spicy noodle dish made with **yak meat** and **vegetables**.\n\nTibetan cuisine is also closely tied to the country's cultural and religious practices. For example, **tsampa** is an important ingredient in many Tibetan dishes, and is often used as an offering to the gods. The preparation and consumption of food is also often accompanied by rituals and ceremonies, which are an important part of Tibetan culture.\n\n[SECTION] Must-Try Dishes [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Dish | Type | Description | Where to Find |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Momo | Dumpling | Tibetan dumplings filled with meat or vegetables | Lhasa, Shigatse |\n| Thukpa | Noodle Soup | Hearty noodle soup made with **yak meat** and **vegetables** | Shigatse, Nyingchi |\n| Laphing | Noodle Dish | Spicy noodle dish made with **yak meat** and **vegetables** | Nyingchi, Lhasa |\n| Shakkar | Dessert | Sweet rice pudding made with **milk** and **sugar** | Lhasa, Shigatse |\n| Gundruk | Soup | Sour soup made with **fermented greens** and **yak meat** | Rural areas, Lhasa |\n| Shapaley | Meat Pie | Tibetan meat pie filled with **yak meat** and **onions** | Lhasa, Shigatse |\n| Thentuk | Noodle Soup | Hearty noodle soup made with **yak meat** and **vegetables** | Shigatse, Nyingchi |\n| Dresi | Dessert | Sweet rice dish made with **milk** and **sugar** | Lhasa, Shigatse |\n| Chhurpi | Snack | Dried **yak meat** snack, often served with **tsampa** | Rural areas, Lhasa |\n| Butter Tea | Beverage | Traditional Tibetan tea made with **butter** and **salt** | Lhasa, Shigatse |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Street Food & Snacks [/SECTION]\n- **Momo** (1-2 USD per piece): Tibetan dumplings filled with meat or vegetables, often served with a side of **chili sauce**\n- **Thukpa** (3-5 USD per bowl): Hearty noodle soup made with **yak meat** and **vegetables**\n- **Laphing** (2-3 USD per bowl): Spicy noodle dish made with **yak meat** and **vegetables**\n- **Shapaley** (2-3 USD per piece): Tibetan meat pie filled with **yak meat** and **onions**\n- **Chhurpi** (1-2 USD per piece): Dried **yak meat** snack, often served with **tsampa**\n- **Tsampa** (1-2 USD per bag): Roasted barley flour, often used to make **tsampa porridge** or **tsampa tea**\n- **Fresh Fruit** (1-2 USD per piece): Fresh fruit such as **apples** and **oranges**, often sold by street vendors\n- **Nuts** (2-3 USD per bag): Roasted nuts such as **almonds** and **walnuts**, often sold by street vendors\n\n[SECTION] Drinks [/SECTION]\n- **Butter Tea** (1-2 USD per cup): Traditional Tibetan tea made with **butter** and **salt**\n- **Tsampa Tea** (1-2 USD per cup): Tibetan tea made with **tsampa** and **milk**\n- **Chang** (2-3 USD per cup): Traditional Tibetan beer made with **barley** and **yeast**\n- **Fresh Juice** (2-3 USD per cup): Fresh juice made with **fruits** such as **oranges** and **grapes**\n- **Mineral Water** (1-2 USD per bottle): Bottled mineral water, often sold by street vendors\n- **Tibetan Coffee** (2-3 USD per cup): Traditional Tibetan coffee made with **coffee beans** and **milk**\n\n[SECTION] Dining Customs [/SECTION]\n- **Eating with Hands**: In Tibetan culture, it is common to eat with your hands, especially when eating **Momo** or **Shapaley**\n- **Using Chopsticks**: In some restaurants, **chopsticks** are provided, especially when eating **Thukpa** or **Laphing**\n- **Tipping**: Tipping is not expected, but rounding up the bill is appreciated\n- **Reservations**: Reservations are not always necessary, but it is recommended to make a reservation for larger groups\n- **Dress Code**: There is no specific dress code, but it is recommended to dress modestly when visiting monasteries or attending cultural events\n- **Table Manners**: It is considered impolite to finish a meal completely, as it implies that the host did not provide enough food\n\n[SECTION] Where to Eat [/SECTION]\n- **Local Restaurants**: Local restaurants, such as **Tibetan Kitchen** and **Lhasa Restaurant**, offer a variety of traditional Tibetan dishes\n- **Food Courts**: Food courts, such as **Lhasa Food Court**, offer a variety of food options, including Tibetan, Chinese, and Indian cuisine\n- **Markets**: Markets, such as **Lhasa Market**, offer a variety of fresh produce, meat, and dairy products\n- **Street Food Stalls**: Street food stalls, such as **Momo Stall**, offer a variety of street food options, including **Momo** and **Thukpa**\n- **Monasteries**: Some monasteries, such as **Jokhang Monastery**, offer traditional Tibetan tea and snacks to visitors\n\n[SECTION] Food Markets & Food Experiences [/SECTION]\n- **Lhasa Market**: A bustling market in the heart of Lhasa, offering a variety of fresh produce, meat, and dairy products\n- **Shigatse Market**: A market in Shigatse, offering a variety of local specialties, including **Thukpa** and **Laphing**\n- **Nyingchi Market**: A market in Nyingchi, offering a variety of local specialties, including **Laphing** and **Shapaley**\n- **Tibetan Kitchen**: A cooking school in Lhasa, offering cooking classes and workshops on traditional Tibetan cuisine\n- **Lhasa Food Festival**: An annual food festival in Lhasa, showcasing the best of Tibetan cuisine and culture",
