[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Tibet is situated in the southwestern part of China, bordered by several countries and Chinese provinces. To the south, Tibet is bordered by Nepal, India, and Bhutan, while to the east, it is bordered by the Chinese provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan. To the north, Tibet is bordered by the Chinese provinces of Xinjiang and Qinghai, and to the southeast, it is bordered by the Chinese province of Gansu and Myanmar. The region is landlocked, with no direct access to the ocean, and is characterized by its unique cultural and geographical landscape.

The location of Tibet has played a significant role in shaping its history, culture, and economy. The region's strategic position has made it an important center for trade and cultural exchange between India, China, and other neighboring countries. The **Himalayan mountain range**, which runs along the southern border of Tibet, has also had a significant impact on the region's climate and ecosystem. The range creates a rain shadow effect, resulting in a dry and arid climate in the north, while the southern parts of Tibet receive more rainfall and have a more temperate climate.

The **Tibetan Plateau**, which covers most of the region, has an average elevation of over 4,500 meters and is home to several major **lakes**, including **Lake Namtso** and **Lake Manasarovar**. The region's unique landscape and climate have also resulted in the formation of several **deserts**, including the **Qiangtang Desert** and the **Changtang Desert**. The **Changtang Desert**, which covers a significant part of northern Tibet, is known for its unique wildlife, including the **Tibetan antelope** and the **snow leopard**.

The terrain and landscape of Tibet have played a significant role in shaping the region's ecosystem and biodiversity.
