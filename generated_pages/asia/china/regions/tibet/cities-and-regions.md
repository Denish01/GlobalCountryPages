[SECTION] How Tibet Is Divided [/SECTION]
Tibet is divided into 7 prefecture-level divisions, which are further subdivided into counties and towns. The administrative structure is designed to balance the needs of the local population with the requirements of the Chinese government. The divisions are based on geographical and cultural factors, with each prefecture having its own unique character and identity. For example, the Ngari Prefecture is known for its high-altitude lakes and mountains, while the Shannan Prefecture is home to many ancient monasteries and temples.

The divisions are also responsible for managing the local economy, education, and healthcare systems. The Tibetan government-in-exile, which is based in Dharamsala, India, also claims to represent the interests of the Tibetan people, although its authority is not recognized by the Chinese government. The complex administrative structure of Tibet reflects the region's complex history and cultural identity.

[SECTION] Getting Around [/SECTION]
Tibet has a well-developed transportation network, with several domestic flights connecting the major cities. The region is also connected to the rest of China by a network of highways and railways, including the Qinghai-Tibet Railway, which runs from Xining to Lhasa. Buses and taxis are also widely available, although the roads can be rough and winding, especially in the rural areas. The best way to get around Tibet is by hiring a private car and driver, or by joining a guided tour. The high altitude of Tibet can also be a challenge for travelers, and it is recommended to acclimate to the altitude gradually by spending a few days in Lhasa or other lower-altitude areas before traveling to the higher-altitude regions.

The transportation network in Tibet is constantly improving, with new roads and railways being built to connect the region to the rest of China. However, the high altitude and rugged terrain of Tibet can still pose challenges for travelers, and it is essential to plan carefully and research the best routes and modes of transportation before embarking on a trip to the region. Additionally, the Chinese government has implemented various regulations and restrictions on travel to Tibet, including requirements for guided tours and permits for certain areas, so it is essential to check the latest travel requirements before planning a trip to the region.
