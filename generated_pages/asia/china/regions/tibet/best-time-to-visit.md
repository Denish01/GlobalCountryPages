[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Tibet has a high-altitude **plateau climate**, with significant variations in temperature and precipitation throughout the year. The region experiences a dry season from October to May, with minimal rainfall and low humidity, and a wet season from June to September, with most of the annual rainfall occurring during these months. The dry season is characterized by cold temperatures, with daytime temperatures ranging from 10°C to 15°C (50°F to 59°F) and nighttime temperatures often dropping below -10°C (14°F). The wet season, on the other hand, is marked by mild temperatures, with daytime temperatures ranging from 15°C to 20°C (59°F to 68°F) and nighttime temperatures ranging from 5°C to 10°C (41°F to 50°F). The seasons have a significant impact on travel in Tibet, with the dry season being the best time for trekking and outdoor activities, and the wet season being the best time for sightseeing and cultural events.

The climate in Tibet also varies by region, with the **northern region** being colder and drier than the **southern region**. The northern region, which includes the cities of Lhasa and Shigatse, experiences a longer dry season, with colder temperatures and less rainfall. The southern region, which includes the cities of Nyingchi and Chamdo, experiences a shorter dry season, with milder temperatures and more rainfall. The regional variations in climate and weather patterns have a significant impact on travel and tourism in Tibet, with different regions being more suitable for different types of activities and experiences.

The high altitude of Tibet also has a significant impact on travel, with many visitors experiencing **altitude sickness**. The high altitude can cause a range of symptoms, including headaches, fatigue, and shortness of breath, and can be particularly challenging for visitors who are not accustomed to high-altitude environments. To minimize the risk of altitude sickness, visitors are advised to ascend gradually, drink plenty of water, and avoid strenuous activities.
