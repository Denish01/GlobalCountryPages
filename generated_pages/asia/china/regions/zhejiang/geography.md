[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Zhejiang is situated in the eastern part of China, bordering the East China Sea to the east, and surrounded by the provinces of Jiangsu to the north, Anhui to the west, Jiangxi to the southwest, and Fujian to the south. The region is strategically located near the Yangtze River Delta, one of the most economically developed areas in China. The East China Sea to the east provides a long coastline, with many ports and harbors that have contributed to the region's economic growth.

The province is also bordered by the Qiantang River to the southwest, which flows into the East China Sea. The region's location has played a significant role in its history and development, with the coastline and rivers providing access to trade and cultural exchange with other parts of China and the world. The proximity to the Yangtze River Delta has also made Zhejiang an important hub for trade and commerce.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Zhejiang's terrain is characterized by a mix of mountains, hills, and plains. The region is home to several mountain ranges, including the Tianmu Mountains, the Xitianmu Mountains, and the Yandang Mountains. These mountains are not only a popular destination for hiking and tourism but also provide a habitat for a diverse range of flora and fauna. The region's landscape is also dotted with numerous lakes, rivers, and waterfalls, including the famous Qiandao Lake, which is known for its scenic beauty and crystal-clear waters.

The coastal areas of Zhejiang are generally flat and low-lying, with many islands and islets scattered along the coastline. The region's coastline is also home to several major ports, including the Port of Ningbo and the Port of Zhoushan, which are among the busiest ports in China. The province's terrain and landscape have played a significant role in shaping its economy, culture, and history, with the mountains, rivers, and coastline providing a rich source of natural resources and inspiration for art and literature.

The region's forests are also an important feature of its landscape, with many areas of natural forest and plantation. The forests provide a habitat for a wide range of wildlife, including many species of birds, mammals, and insects. The forests also play a crucial role in regulating the region's climate, preventing soil erosion, and providing natural resources such as timber and non-timber forest products.
