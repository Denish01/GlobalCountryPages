[SECTION] Food Culture Overview [/SECTION]
Zhejiang's cuisine is defined by its emphasis on fresh ingredients, particularly seafood and vegetables, which are often combined with sweet and savory flavors. The region's proximity to the East China Sea and its numerous rivers and lakes provide an abundance of fish and other seafood, which are staples in many Zhejiang dishes. The cuisine is also influenced by the region's history and cultural heritage, with many dishes originating from the Southern Song Dynasty. Regional variations within Zhejiang include the Hangzhou style, which is known for its delicate flavors and intricate presentation, and the Ningbo style, which is characterized by its bold flavors and hearty portions.

Zhejiang's cuisine is also known for its use of **Shaoxing wine**, a type of fermented rice wine that is used in many dishes to add depth and complexity. The region is also famous for its **Longjing tea**, a type of green tea that is grown in the hills surrounding Hangzhou and is often served at mealtimes. The combination of these ingredients and influences has resulted in a unique and flavorful cuisine that is distinct from other regions in China.

The food culture in Zhejiang is also closely tied to the region's social and cultural traditions. Mealtimes are often seen as opportunities to bond with family and friends, and dishes are often served in a specific order to promote harmony and balance. For example, dishes are often served in a sequence that alternates between sweet and savory flavors, and between hot and cold temperatures.
