The eleven prefecture-level cities are Hangzhou, Ningbo, Wenzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, Shaoxing, Jinhua, Quzhou, Zhoushan, Taizhou, and Lishui.

The province is also crisscrossed by a network of scenic roads and highways, making it easy to explore the countryside and coastal areas by car or bus. For longer journeys, the high-speed train network is a convenient and efficient option, with trains connecting Zhejiang to major cities like Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangzhou.\n\nIn terms of driving conditions, Zhejiang's roads are generally well-maintained, with modern highways and scenic routes that offer stunning views of the countryside and coastline. However, traffic in the major cities can be heavy, especially during peak hours, and parking can be a challenge in urban areas.
