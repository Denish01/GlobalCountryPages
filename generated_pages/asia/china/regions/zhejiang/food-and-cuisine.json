The region's proximity to the East China Sea and its numerous rivers and lakes provide an abundance of fish and other seafood, which are staples in many Zhejiang dishes. The cuisine is also influenced by the region's history and cultural heritage, with many dishes originating from the Southern Song Dynasty. Regional variations within Zhejiang include the Hangzhou style, which is known for its delicate flavors and intricate presentation, and the Ningbo style, which is characterized by its bold flavors and hearty portions.\n\nZhejiang's cuisine is also known for its use of **Shaoxing wine**, a type of fermented rice wine that is used in many dishes to add depth and complexity. The region is also famous for its **Longjing tea**, a type of green tea that is grown in the hills surrounding Hangzhou and is often served at mealtimes. The combination of these ingredients and influences has resulted in a unique and flavorful cuisine that is distinct from other regions in China.\n\nThe food culture in Zhejiang is also closely tied to the region's social and cultural traditions. Mealtimes are often seen as opportunities to bond with family and friends, and dishes are often served in a specific order to promote harmony and balance. For example, dishes are often served in a sequence that alternates between sweet and savory flavors, and between hot and cold temperatures.\n\n[SECTION] Must-Try Dishes [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Dish | Type | Description | Where to Find |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Dongpo Pork | braised meat | traditional braised pork belly dish | Hangzhou restaurants |\n| Steamed Fish with Pickled Mustard Greens | steamed fish | fish steamed with pickled mustard greens and chili peppers | Ningbo seafood restaurants |\n| West Lake Fish in Vinegar | steamed fish | fish steamed with vinegar and ginger | Hangzhou restaurants |\n| Beggar's Chicken | roasted chicken | chicken stuffed with herbs and spices, wrapped in lotus leaves | Shaoxing restaurants |\n| Stir-Fried Eel with Garlic | stir-fry | eel stir-fried with garlic and chili peppers | Ningbo seafood restaurants |\n| Braised Abalone with Mushrooms | braised seafood | abalone braised with mushrooms and soy sauce | Hangzhou high-end restaurants |\n| Wontons in Chili Oil | dumplings | wontons served in a spicy chili oil sauce | street food stalls |\n| Steamed Dumplings with Pork and Vegetables | dumplings | steamed dumplings filled with pork and vegetables | Hangzhou restaurants |\n| Fried Rice with Seafood | fried rice | fried rice dish with shrimp, scallops, and vegetables | Ningbo seafood restaurants |\n| Tofu in Oyster Sauce | tofu dish | tofu braised in oyster sauce with mushrooms and vegetables | vegetarian restaurants |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Street Food & Snacks [/SECTION]\n- **Roujiamo**, a Chinese hamburger made with braised pork and served in a crispy bun, $1.50\n- **Jianbing**, a savory crêpe filled with eggs, vegetables, and sometimes meat, $1.50\n- **Stinky Tofu**, a fermented tofu dish with a strong odor, $2.00\n- **Grilled Squid**, a popular street food made with grilled squid and served with a spicy sauce, $3.00\n- **Fried Dumplings**, a crispy fried dumpling filled with pork and vegetables, $2.50\n- **Rice Cakes with Sesame**, a traditional snack made with rice cakes and sesame seeds, $1.00\n\n[SECTION] Drinks [/SECTION]\n- **Shaoxing Wine**, a type of fermented rice wine used in cooking and as a beverage, $5.00 per bottle\n- **Longjing Tea**, a type of green tea grown in the hills surrounding Hangzhou, $2.00 per cup\n- **Jiangnan Beer**, a local beer brewed in Zhejiang, $3.00 per bottle\n- **Chinese Coffee**, a strong and bitter coffee made with coffee beans and sugar, $1.50 per cup\n- **Fresh Juice**, a refreshing drink made with fresh fruits such as orange, watermelon, and mango, $2.00 per cup\n- **Ginseng Tea**, a herbal tea made with ginseng and other herbs, $2.50 per cup\n\n[SECTION] Dining Customs [/SECTION]\n- **Table Manners**, it is customary to wait for the host to start eating before beginning your meal\n- **Chopstick Etiquette**, it is considered impolite to leave your chopsticks standing upright in your rice bowl\n- **Tipping**, it is not customary to tip in most restaurants, but 5-10% is appreciated in high-end establishments\n- **Reservation**, it is recommended to make a reservation at popular restaurants, especially during peak hours\n- **Dress Code**, it is not necessary to dress formally for most restaurants, but it is recommended to dress modestly and avoid revealing clothing\n- **Gift-Giving**, it is customary to bring a small gift, such as a bottle of wine or a box of chocolates, when invited to a meal at someone's home\n\n[SECTION] Where to Eat [/SECTION]\n- **Food Courts**, a great place to try a variety of dishes at affordable prices, $5.00 per meal\n- **Street Food Stalls**, a popular place to try local street food and snacks, $1.00-$3.00 per item\n- **Mid-Range Restaurants**, a good option for trying traditional Zhejiang dishes at moderate prices, $10.00-$20.00 per meal\n- **High-End Restaurants**, a great place to try high-end Zhejiang cuisine and enjoy a luxurious dining experience, $50.00-$100.00 per meal\n- **Markets**, a great place to try local fruits, vegetables, and snacks, $1.00-$5.00 per item\n\n[SECTION] Food Markets & Food Experiences [/SECTION]\n- **Hangzhou Qinghefang Ancient Street**, a historic street filled with traditional shops and restaurants, located in the heart of Hangzhou\n- **Ningbo Tianyi Square**, a popular square with a variety of food stalls and restaurants, located in the center of Ningbo\n- **Shaoxing Lu Xun Native Place**, a scenic area with traditional restaurants and tea houses, located in the hometown of the famous Chinese writer Lu Xun\n- **West Lake**, a beautiful lake with many restaurants and tea houses, located in the heart of Hangzhou\n- **Zhejiang Provincial Museum**, a museum with a restaurant serving traditional Zhejiang cuisine, located in Hangzhou",
