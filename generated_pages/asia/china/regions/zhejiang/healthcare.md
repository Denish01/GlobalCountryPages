[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in Zhejiang is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering a range of medical services. The public healthcare system is generally of high quality, with well-equipped hospitals and skilled medical professionals. However, the quality of care can vary significantly between urban and rural areas, with urban areas like Hangzhou and Ningbo tend to have better-equipped and staffed hospitals. The private healthcare sector is also well-developed, with many high-end hospitals and clinics catering to expats and wealthy locals. Overall, the quality of care in Zhejiang is considered to be among the best in China.

The structure of the healthcare system in Zhejiang is based on a three-tier model, with primary care provided by community health centers and clinics, secondary care provided by general hospitals, and tertiary care provided by specialized hospitals and research institutions. The system is generally well-organized, with a strong emphasis on preventive care and public health programs. However, the healthcare system can be complex and bureaucratic, and navigating it can be challenging for foreigners who do not speak Mandarin.

Despite these challenges, Zhejiang has made significant progress in recent years in improving its healthcare system, with a focus on increasing access to care, improving the quality of care, and reducing costs. The province has also invested heavily in medical research and education, with several top-ranked medical universities and research institutions. As a result, Zhejiang has become a popular destination for medical tourism, with many foreigners traveling to the province for high-quality and affordable medical care.
