Shandong's culinary scene is also influenced by its history as a major trading hub, with flavors and ingredients from other parts of China and beyond.\n\nShandong's cuisine can be broadly divided into three regional variations: **Jiaodong**, **Central Shandong**, and **South Shandong**. Jiaodong cuisine is known for its emphasis on seafood, while Central Shandong cuisine is famous for its **Dezhou braised chicken**. South Shandong cuisine, on the other hand, is characterized by its use of sweet potatoes and corn. Each region has its own unique flavor profile and specialties, making Shandong a fascinating destination for foodies.\n\nShandong's food culture is also deeply rooted in its history and traditions. The region is home to many **temple fairs** and **food festivals**, where locals gather to enjoy traditional dishes and drinks. The **Qingdao Beer Festival**, for example, is a popular event that showcases the region's famous **Tsingtao beer**.
