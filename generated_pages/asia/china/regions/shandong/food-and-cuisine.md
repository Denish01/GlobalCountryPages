[SECTION] Food Culture Overview [/SECTION]
Shandong's cuisine is known for its bold flavors, hearty portions, and emphasis on fresh seafood. The region's unique flavor profile is shaped by its geographic location, with the Yellow Sea to the east and the mountains to the west. **Lu cuisine**, one of the eight major Chinese cuisines, originated in Shandong and is characterized by its use of garlic, ginger, and scallions. Shandong's culinary scene is also influenced by its history as a major trading hub, with flavors and ingredients from other parts of China and beyond.

Shandong's cuisine can be broadly divided into three regional variations: **Jiaodong**, **Central Shandong**, and **South Shandong**. Jiaodong cuisine is known for its emphasis on seafood, while Central Shandong cuisine is famous for its **Dezhou braised chicken**. South Shandong cuisine, on the other hand, is characterized by its use of sweet potatoes and corn. Each region has its own unique flavor profile and specialties, making Shandong a fascinating destination for foodies.

Shandong's food culture is also deeply rooted in its history and traditions. The region is home to many **temple fairs** and **food festivals**, where locals gather to enjoy traditional dishes and drinks. The **Qingdao Beer Festival**, for example, is a popular event that showcases the region's famous **Tsingtao beer**. Visitors can experience the vibrant food culture of Shandong by attending one of these festivals or by visiting a local **night market**.
