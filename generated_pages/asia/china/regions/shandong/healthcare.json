  "content": "Healthcare in Shandong, a region in China, is a mixed system that combines public and private providers, offering a range of services to its large population, with a quality of care that varies between urban and rural areas.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nQuality Rating: Good\nEmergency Number: 120\nHospital Standard: Good\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: widespread\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nShandong's healthcare system is structured into three tiers, with primary care provided by community health centers and clinics, secondary care provided by general hospitals, and tertiary care provided by specialized hospitals. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of good quality, with well-equipped facilities and trained medical staff, especially in urban areas such as Jinan, the capital city of Shandong. However, the quality of care can vary significantly in rural areas, where facilities and resources may be more limited. The private healthcare sector is also well-developed, with many high-end hospitals and clinics catering to expats and affluent locals.\n\nThe Chinese government has implemented various healthcare reforms in recent years, aimed at improving access to healthcare and reducing costs. These reforms have led to an increase in health insurance coverage, with over 90% of the population now having some form of insurance. Despite these efforts, healthcare costs can still be high, especially for specialized treatments and medications. Patients often need to pay out-of-pocket for services, although many hospitals and clinics now accept insurance and offer package deals for common procedures.\n\nUrban areas in Shandong, such as Qingdao and Yantai, tend to have better healthcare facilities and more specialized medical services than rural areas. Many hospitals in these cities have international departments and offer services tailored to expats and foreign visitors. However, language barriers can still be a challenge, and patients may need to bring a translator or use translation services to communicate with medical staff.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Qilu Hospital of Shandong University | Jinan | Public | Cardiology, Oncology, Neurosurgery | Yes |\n| Shandong Provincial Hospital | Jinan | Public | General Medicine, Surgery, Pediatrics | Limited |\n| Qingdao Municipal Hospital | Qingdao | Public | General Medicine, Surgery, Obstetrics | Yes |\n| Yantai Yuhuangding Hospital | Yantai | Public | General Medicine, Surgery, Orthopedics | Limited |\n| Weifang People's Hospital | Weifang | Public | General Medicine, Surgery, Urology | Limited |\n| Jinan International Hospital | Jinan | Private | General Medicine, Surgery, Dental Care | Yes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- Expats and foreigners are recommended to purchase private health insurance that covers them in China, as many local insurance plans may not provide adequate coverage for non-Chinese citizens.\n- The Chinese government offers a range of health insurance options, including the **Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance** and the **New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme**.\n- Some local insurance companies, such as **Ping An Insurance** and **China Life**, offer health insurance plans that cater to expats and foreigners.\n- Costs for health insurance in Shandong can vary widely, depending on the type of plan, age, and pre-existing conditions.\n- Some hospitals and clinics may offer package deals or discounts for patients who pay upfront or have insurance coverage.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- Medications are widely available in Shandong, with many pharmacies and drugstores located throughout the region.\n- Prescription medications can be obtained from hospitals, clinics, or licensed pharmacies, although some may require a **prescription from a Chinese doctor**.\n- Common brands of medications, such as **Tylenol** and **Advil**, are widely available, although generic versions may be more affordable.\n- Costs for medications can vary, depending on the type and brand, although many pharmacies offer discounts for bulk purchases or loyalty programs.\n- Some pharmacies may also offer **traditional Chinese medicine** and herbal remedies, which can be popular among locals.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- Vaccinations against **hepatitis A** and **typhoid fever** are recommended for travelers to Shandong, especially those who plan to eat or drink outside of major restaurants and hotels.\n- The **rabies vaccine** is also recommended, as there have been cases of rabies in the region.\n- Shandong is considered to be a low-risk area for **malaria**, although travelers to rural areas may still need to take precautions.\n- **Food safety** can be a concern, especially for travelers who eat from street vendors or consume undercooked meat or seafood.\n- **Water safety** is also a concern, and travelers are advised to drink bottled or filtered water to avoid waterborne illnesses.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- Shandong is not a major destination for medical tourism, although some hospitals and clinics may offer specialized treatments or procedures at competitive prices.\n- **Cosmetic surgery** and **dental care** are popular among locals and foreigners, with many clinics offering package deals and discounts.\n- Some hospitals, such as the **Qilu Hospital of Shandong University**, have international departments and offer services tailored to expats and foreign visitors.\n- Costs for medical procedures in Shandong can be significantly lower than in other countries, making it an attractive option for some patients.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- In the event of an emergency, patients should call **120** for an ambulance or go to the nearest hospital.\n- Many hospitals in Shandong have emergency departments that are open 24/7, although language barriers can still be a challenge.\n- Patients may need to pay upfront for emergency services, although many hospitals and clinics now accept insurance and offer package deals.\n- Expats and foreigners are advised to carry a **medical evacuation insurance** policy, in case they need to be transported to a hospital in another city or country.\n- Patients should also keep a **list of emergency contacts**, including their embassy and insurance provider, in case of an emergency.",
