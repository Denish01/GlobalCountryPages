The region's proximity to the Yangtze River and the East China Sea provides an abundance of fresh seafood, which is often paired with traditional ingredients like soy sauce, ginger, and scallions. Jiangsu's cuisine is also influenced by its history as a major cultural and economic center, with many dishes reflecting the region's rich heritage and cultural exchange. Regional variations within Jiangsu include the **Huaiyang** style, which is characterized by its use of fresh fish and delicate seasonings, and the **Suzhou** style, which is known for its intricate presentation and use of high-quality ingredients.\n\nJiangsu's cuisine is often associated with the concept of **\"ben wei\"**, or \"original flavor\", which emphasizes the importance of preserving the natural flavors of ingredients. This approach is reflected in the region's use of light seasonings and delicate cooking methods, which allow the natural flavors of the ingredients to shine through. Jiangsu's cuisine is also known for its emphasis on **\"yin\"** and **\"yang\"** principles, with many dishes designed to balance the opposing forces of hot and cold, sweet and savory.\n\nThe region's culinary scene is also influenced by its history as a major center of trade and commerce, with many dishes reflecting the cultural exchange and influence of other regions. For example, the **\"Suzhou-style\"** **Braised Pork Belly** is a classic dish that reflects the region's cultural exchange with the southern province of Guangdong.\n\n[SECTION] Must-Try Dishes [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Dish | Type | Description | Where to Find |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Dongpo Pork | Pork | Braised pork belly with a sweet and savory sauce | Nanjing, Suzhou |\n| Braised Abalone | Seafood | Abalone cooked in a rich and flavorful sauce | Suzhou, Wuxi |\n| Steamed Fish with Scallions | Seafood | Fresh fish steamed with scallions and ginger | Huai'an, Yancheng |\n| Wonton Soup | Noodle | Thin noodles served in a light broth with wontons | Suzhou, Nanjing |\n| Suzhou-style Dumplings | Dumpling | Delicate dumplings filled with pork and vegetables | Suzhou, Wuxi |\n| Jiangsu-style Fried Noodles | Noodle | Crispy fried noodles with vegetables and meat | Nanjing, Huai'an |\n| Steamed Buns with Pork | Bread | Soft steamed buns filled with braised pork | Suzhou, Nanjing |\n| Braised Eggplant | Vegetable | Eggplant cooked in a rich and savory sauce | Wuxi, Changzhou |\n| Fried Scallops with Salted Egg | Seafood | Scallops fried with salted egg and chili peppers | Yancheng, Nantong |\n| Suzhou-style Cakes | Dessert | Delicate cakes filled with sweet fillings | Suzhou, Nanjing |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Street Food & Snacks [/SECTION]\n- **Jiangsu-style Fried Dough Sticks** (1-2 USD): crispy fried dough sticks often served with soy milk or congee\n- **Suzhou-style Dumplings** (2-3 USD): delicate dumplings filled with pork and vegetables, often served in a light broth\n- **Grilled Scallops** (3-5 USD): fresh scallops grilled with salt and pepper, often served with a side of chili sauce\n- **Steamed Buns with Pork** (1-2 USD): soft steamed buns filled with braised pork, often served with a side of pickled vegetables\n- **Fried Noodles with Vegetables** (2-3 USD): crispy fried noodles with vegetables and meat, often served with a side of chili sauce\n- **Suzhou-style Cakes** (1-2 USD): delicate cakes filled with sweet fillings, often served with a cup of tea\n\n[SECTION] Drinks [/SECTION]\n- **Jiangsu-style Green Tea** (1-2 USD): a light and refreshing green tea, often served with a side of snacks\n- **Suzhou-style Rice Wine** (5-10 USD): a sweet and flavorful rice wine, often served with a side of dishes\n- **Fresh Juice** (2-3 USD): fresh juice made from local fruits, often served with a side of snacks\n- **Soy Milk** (1-2 USD): a creamy and nutritious soy milk, often served with a side of fried dough sticks\n- **Chrysanthemum Tea** (2-3 USD): a floral and refreshing tea, often served with a side of snacks\n- **Chinese Beer** (3-5 USD): a crisp and refreshing beer, often served with a side of dishes\n\n[SECTION] Dining Customs [/SECTION]\n- **Table Manners**: it is customary to wait for the host to start eating before beginning your meal\n- **Chopstick Etiquette**: it is considered impolite to leave your chopsticks standing upright in your rice bowl\n- **Tipping**: tipping is not expected, but 5-10% is appreciated for exceptional service\n- **Reservations**: reservations are often required for high-end restaurants, especially during peak travel seasons\n- **Dress Code**: a smart casual dress code is often required for high-end restaurants\n- **Gift-Giving**: it is customary to bring a small gift, such as a box of chocolates or a bottle of wine, when invited to a dinner party\n\n[SECTION] Where to Eat [/SECTION]\n- **Local Markets**: try the local markets, such as the **Suzhou Night Market**, for a variety of street food and snacks\n- **Food Courts**: try the food courts, such as the **Nanjing Food Court**, for a variety of dishes at affordable prices\n- **High-End Restaurants**: try the high-end restaurants, such as the **Suzhou Restaurant**, for a luxurious dining experience\n- **Tea Houses**: try the tea houses, such as the **Jiangsu Tea House**, for a traditional tea-drinking experience\n- **Street Food Stalls**: try the street food stalls, such as the **Suzhou Street Food Stall**, for a quick and delicious meal\n\n[SECTION] Food Markets & Food Experiences [/SECTION]\n- **Suzhou Night Market**: a bustling night market with a variety of street food and snacks\n- **Nanjing Food Court**: a large food court with a variety of dishes at affordable prices\n- **Jiangsu Tea House**: a traditional tea house with a variety of teas and snacks\n- **Suzhou Street Food Stall**: a popular street food stall with a variety of dishes, including **Dongpo Pork** and **Braised Abalone**\n- **Wuxi Farmers' Market**: a bustling farmers' market with a variety of fresh produce and local products",
