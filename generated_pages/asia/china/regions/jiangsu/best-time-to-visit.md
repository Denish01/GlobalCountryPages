[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Jiangsu is a region in eastern China, with a humid subtropical climate, characterized by four distinct seasons. The region experiences a dry and cold winter, a mild and pleasant spring, a hot and humid summer, and a cool and comfortable autumn. The weather in Jiangsu is influenced by its location near the East China Sea, with the coastal areas tend to be cooler and more humid than the inland areas. The region's climate is also affected by the monsoon season, which brings heavy rainfall and strong winds during the summer months.

The best time to visit Jiangsu depends on the activities and experiences you are looking for. If you prefer mild weather and smaller crowds, the spring and autumn months are the best times to visit. If you are looking for a beach vacation or want to enjoy the region's outdoor recreational activities, the summer months may be the best time to visit, despite the hot and humid weather. The winter months are generally the coolest and driest, making it a good time to visit if you prefer cooler weather and lower prices.

The seasons in Jiangsu can affect travel in various ways. During the peak season, from June to August, the region's popular tourist attractions can be very crowded, and the prices for accommodations and tourist services tend to be higher. The budget season, from December to February, may be a good time to visit if you are looking for lower prices, but some tourist attractions and facilities may be closed or operate on reduced hours.
