Jiangsu's cuisine is known for its emphasis on fresh ingredients, delicate flavors, and intricate preparation methods. The region's proximity to the Yangtze River and the East China Sea provides an abundance of fresh seafood, which is often paired with traditional ingredients like soy sauce, ginger, and scallions. Jiangsu's cuisine is also influenced by its history as a major cultural and economic center, with many dishes reflecting the region's rich heritage and cultural exchange. Regional variations within Jiangsu include the **Huaiyang** style, which is characterized by its use of fresh fish and delicate seasonings, and the **Suzhou** style, which is known for its intricate presentation and use of high-quality ingredients.

Jiangsu's cuisine is often associated with the concept of **"ben wei"**, or "original flavor", which emphasizes the importance of preserving the natural flavors of ingredients. This approach is reflected in the region's use of light seasonings and delicate cooking methods, which allow the natural flavors of the ingredients to shine through. Jiangsu's cuisine is also known for its emphasis on **"yin"** and **"yang"** principles, with many dishes designed to balance the opposing forces of hot and cold, sweet and savory.

The region's culinary scene is also influenced by its history as a major center of trade and commerce, with many dishes reflecting the cultural exchange and influence of other regions.
