[SECTION] How Xinjiang Is Divided [/SECTION]
Xinjiang is a vast and diverse region, covering over 1.6 million square kilometers in northwest China. The region is divided into 14 prefectures, which are further subdivided into counties, cities, and towns. The administrative structure of Xinjiang is complex, with a mix of prefecture-level cities, autonomous prefectures, and counties. The region is governed by the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region People's Government, which is responsible for implementing national policies and overseeing the region's economic, social, and cultural development.

The division of Xinjiang into different prefectures and counties reflects the region's geographic and cultural diversity. The prefectures are often defined by their natural features, such as mountains, rivers, and deserts, as well as their cultural and ethnic characteristics. For example, the Kashgar Prefecture is known for its Uyghur culture and history, while the Altay Prefecture is home to a mix of Kazakh and Mongolian ethnic groups.
