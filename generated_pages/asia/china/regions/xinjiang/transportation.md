[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Xinjiang is a vast region in northwest China, and the most convenient way to get there is by flying into one of the two main international airports: Urumqi Diwopu International Airport (URC) or Kashgar Airport (KHG). Urumqi Airport is the largest airport in the region and has direct flights to many major cities in China, including Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, as well as some international destinations such as Almaty, Bishkek, and Istanbul. Kashgar Airport is smaller but still has direct flights to several cities in China, including Urumqi, Beijing, and Shanghai. Overland entry points include the borders with Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Pakistan, although these routes can be more complicated and time-consuming.

For travelers who prefer to enter Xinjiang by land, there are several overland entry points along the borders with neighboring countries. The most popular route is the **Khunjerab Pass**, which connects Xinjiang to Pakistan's Hunza Valley. Another option is the **Torugart Pass**, which links Xinjiang to Kyrgyzstan's Naryn Province. However, these routes often require special permits and can be affected by weather conditions, so it's essential to plan carefully and research the latest regulations before attempting to enter Xinjiang by land.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Xinjiang has an extensive domestic air network, with several airlines operating flights to and from the region. The main airlines serving Xinjiang include China Southern, China Eastern, and Hainan Airlines, which offer flights to many cities in China, including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Xi'an. Some of the most popular domestic routes include Urumqi to Beijing, Urumqi to Shanghai, and Urumqi to Guangzhou. When booking domestic flights, it's a good idea to compare prices across different airlines and book in advance to secure the best deals. Approximate costs for domestic flights in China can range from $100 to $500 or more, depending on the route and class of service.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Xinjiang has an extensive rail network, with several high-speed rail lines connecting the region to other parts of China. The **Lanzhou-Xinjiang High-Speed Railway** is one of the most important rail lines in the region, linking Urumqi to Lanzhou in Gansu Province. Another key route is the **Kashgar-Hotan Railway**, which connects Kashgar to Hotan in southern Xinjiang. Train travel is a convenient and relatively affordable way to get around Xinjiang, with ticket prices ranging from $10 to $100 or more, depending on the route and class of service. Booking train tickets can be done online or at train stations, and it's a good idea to book in advance, especially during peak travel seasons.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Xinjiang has a well-developed bus network, with several intercity bus companies operating routes to and from the region. The main bus companies include the Xinjiang Bus Company and the Urumqi Bus Company, which offer routes to many cities in Xinjiang, including Urumqi, Kashgar, and Hotan. Bus travel is a more affordable option than flying or taking the train, with ticket prices ranging from $5 to $50 or more, depending on the route and class of service. However, bus travel can be slower and less comfortable than other modes of transportation, and roads in some areas of Xinjiang can be rough and winding.
