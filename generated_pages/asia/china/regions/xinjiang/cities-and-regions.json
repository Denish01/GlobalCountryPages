The region is divided into 14 prefectures, which are further subdivided into counties, cities, and towns. The administrative structure of Xinjiang is complex, with a mix of prefecture-level cities, autonomous prefectures, and counties. The region is governed by the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region People's Government, which is responsible for implementing national policies and overseeing the region's economic, social, and cultural development.\n\nThe division of Xinjiang into different prefectures and counties reflects the region's geographic and cultural diversity. The prefectures are often defined by their natural features, such as mountains, rivers, and deserts, as well as their cultural and ethnic characteristics. For example, the Kashgar Prefecture is known for its Uyghur culture and history, while the Altay Prefecture is home to a mix of Kazakh and Mongolian ethnic groups.\n\n[SECTION] Major Cities [/SECTION]\n**Ürümqi** (3.5 million)\nRole: capital, economic hub\nKnown For: its rich cultural heritage and history, as well as its modern infrastructure and amenities\nBest For: visitors interested in history, culture, and shopping\n\n**Kashgar** (500,000)\nRole: cultural center, historic city\nKnown For: its well-preserved ancient architecture, vibrant markets, and rich Uyghur culture\nBest For: visitors interested in history, culture, and traditional crafts\n\n**Aksu** (500,000)\nRole: economic hub, industrial center\nKnown For: its textile and manufacturing industries, as well as its natural resources and scenic beauty\nBest For: visitors interested in industry, trade, and outdoor activities\n\n**Karamay** (400,000)\nRole: oil and gas hub, industrial center\nKnown For: its rich oil and gas reserves, as well as its modern infrastructure and amenities\nBest For: visitors interested in industry, energy, and technology\n\n**Yining** (300,000)\nRole: cultural center, historic city\nKnown For: its rich cultural heritage and history, as well as its natural beauty and outdoor recreational opportunities\nBest For: visitors interested in history, culture, and outdoor activities\n\n[SECTION] Key Regions [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Region | Character | Known For | Major City |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Tarim Basin | arid, desert landscape | oil and gas reserves, ancient ruins | Korla |\n| Tian Shan Mountains | mountainous, scenic | hiking, skiing, natural beauty | Ürümqi |\n| Xinjiang Desert | arid, desert landscape | natural beauty, outdoor recreation | Hami |\n| Ili Valley | fertile, agricultural | agriculture, natural beauty | Yining |\n| Altay Mountains | mountainous, scenic | hiking, skiing, natural beauty | Altay |\n| Kashgar Prefecture | culturally rich, historic | Uyghur culture, ancient architecture | Kashgar |\n| Aksu Prefecture | economically developed, industrial | textile and manufacturing industries | Aksu |\n| Karamay Prefecture | oil and gas rich, industrial | oil and gas reserves, modern infrastructure | Karamay |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Differences [/SECTION]\n- The regions of Xinjiang differ significantly in terms of culture, with the south being predominantly Uyghur and the north being more diverse, with Kazakh, Mongolian, and Han Chinese populations.\n- The economy of Xinjiang also varies by region, with the north being more industrialized and the south being more agricultural.\n- The climate of Xinjiang ranges from arid desert in the south to mountainous and scenic in the north, with the Tian Shan Mountains and the Altay Mountains offering opportunities for hiking, skiing, and outdoor recreation.\n- The language spoken in Xinjiang also varies by region, with Mandarin being the official language, but Uyghur, Kazakh, and Mongolian also being widely spoken in different areas.\n\n[SECTION] Getting Around [/SECTION]\nXinjiang has a well-developed transportation network, with domestic flights connecting the region to major cities in China. The region is also connected by train, with the Lanxin Railway linking Xinjiang to the rest of China. Buses and taxis are also widely available, and many visitors choose to drive or take a private car service to get around. However, driving conditions can be challenging, especially in the rural areas, and visitors should be prepared for long distances and rough roads.\n\nThe transportation network in Xinjiang is constantly improving, with new airports, roads, and railways being built to connect the region to the rest of China and Central Asia. Visitors can also take advantage of the region's scenic beauty and outdoor recreational opportunities by hiking, skiing, or taking a horseback ride through the mountains and countryside. However, visitors should also be aware of the regional differences and cultural sensitivities, and take necessary precautions to ensure a safe and enjoyable trip.
