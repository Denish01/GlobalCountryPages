In addition to its airport and rail connections, Shenzhen is also accessible by bus, with several major bus stations offering routes to cities throughout Guangdong Province and beyond. The city's proximity to Hong Kong also makes it a popular destination for travelers, with many tour operators offering day trips and longer excursions to Shenzhen from the Special Administrative Region. Whether you're traveling by air, land, or sea, getting to Shenzhen is relatively easy, and the city's well-developed transportation infrastructure makes it simple to get around once you arrive.
