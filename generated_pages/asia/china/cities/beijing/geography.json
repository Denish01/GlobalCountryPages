Beijing is a landlocked city, with no direct access to the ocean, but it is connected to the Yellow Sea via the Grand Canal. The city's strategic location has made it an important center for trade, commerce, and politics throughout Chinese history.\n\nThe location of Beijing has played a significant role in shaping the city's culture, economy, and environment. The city's proximity to the Yellow Sea and the Grand Canal has facilitated trade and cultural exchange with other parts of China and the world. The surrounding mountains and plains have also influenced the city's climate, with cold winters and hot summers. The city's geography has also made it vulnerable to natural disasters such as earthquakes and floods, which have had a significant impact on the city's development and infrastructure.\n\n[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]\nBeijing's terrain is characterized by a mix of mountains, hills, and plains. The city is situated in the northern part of the North China Plain, which is a vast alluvial plain that stretches from the Yellow Sea to the Taihang Mountains. The plain is surrounded by mountains, including the Yan Mountains to the north and the Taihang Mountains to the south. The city's terrain is also marked by several rivers, including the Yongding River, which flows through the city and provides water for irrigation and other uses.\n\nThe mountains and hills surrounding Beijing have played a significant role in shaping the city's landscape and climate. The Yan Mountains, which are located to the north of the city, are a popular destination for hiking and skiing. The Taihang Mountains, which are located to the south, are known for their scenic beauty and are home to several ancient temples and monasteries. The city's plains are also home to several lakes and wetlands, which provide habitat for a variety of birds and other wildlife.\n\nBeijing's terrain has also been shaped by human activity, with the city's rapid growth and urbanization leading to significant changes in the landscape.
