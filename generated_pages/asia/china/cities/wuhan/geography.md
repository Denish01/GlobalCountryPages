[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Wuhan is situated in the eastern part of the Hubei province, where the Yangtze River and Han River intersect. This strategic location has made Wuhan an important transportation hub and a key city in the development of central China. The city is bordered by the provinces of Henan to the north, Jiangxi to the southeast, and Hunan to the southwest. Wuhan is also surrounded by several smaller cities and counties, including Huanggang, Xiaogan, and Jingmen.

Wuhan's location in the central part of China makes it an important link between the eastern coastal regions and the western interior. The city is connected to the rest of China by a network of highways, railways, and waterways, including the Yangtze River, which flows through the city and provides a major transportation route. Wuhan is also a key stop on the Beijing-Guangzhou high-speed rail line, making it easily accessible from other major cities in China.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Wuhan's terrain is characterized by a mix of mountains, hills, and plains. The city is situated in the Jianghan Plain, a vast alluvial plain that stretches from the Yangtze River to the Han River. The plain is surrounded by several mountain ranges, including the Dabie Mountains to the north and the Mufu Mountains to the south. The city itself is relatively flat, with an average elevation of around 20-30 meters above sea level. Wuhan's landscape is also dotted with several lakes and rivers, including the East Lake, which is one of the largest lakes in China.

The surrounding mountains and hills provide a natural barrier against strong winds and extreme weather conditions, making Wuhan's climate relatively mild and stable. However, the city is also prone to flooding, particularly during the summer months when heavy rainfall can cause the Yangtze River and Han River to overflow. To mitigate this risk, the city has built several dams and levees, including the famous **Yangtze River Dam**, which is one of the largest hydroelectric dams in the world.

Wuhan's landscape is also home to several unique geological features, including the **Huanghelou Scenic Area**, which features a series of limestone caves and rock formations. The city is also surrounded by several national parks and nature reserves, including the **Wuhan East Lake National Park**, which provides a habitat for several endangered species of plants and animals.
