[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Tianjin is situated in the northern part of China, approximately 120 kilometers southeast of Beijing, the country's capital. The city is bordered by the Beijing Municipality to the northwest and Hebei Province to the north, south, and east. Tianjin is also bounded by the Yellow Sea and the Bohai Gulf to the east, providing it with a significant coastline and access to the Pacific Ocean. The city's strategic location has made it an important center for trade, commerce, and industry in the region.

The city's proximity to Beijing and its coastal location have contributed to its historical and cultural significance. Tianjin has been an important hub for international trade and cultural exchange, with many foreign concession areas and historical buildings still present in the city. The city's borders with Hebei Province and Beijing Municipality also make it a key transportation hub, with several major highways, railways, and waterways connecting it to other parts of China and the world.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Tianjin's terrain is characterized by a mix of flat plains, coastal areas, and hills. The city is situated on the North China Plain, one of the most fertile and densely populated regions in China. The plain is bounded by the Yan Mountains to the north and the Yellow Sea to the east, creating a unique landscape of flatlands, rivers, and coastal wetlands. The city's coastal areas are also home to several major ports, including the Tianjin Port, one of the busiest ports in China.

The city's landscape is also marked by several major rivers, including the Hai River, which flows through the city and provides water and transportation links to other parts of China. The surrounding countryside is largely flat, with few hills or mountains, making it ideal for agriculture and urban development. However, the city's flat terrain also makes it prone to flooding, particularly during heavy rainfall or storm surges from the sea.

The city's hills and mountains are largely located in the northern and western parts of the city, where the terrain becomes more rugged and elevated. The Jiuyongguan mountain, located in the northwest of the city, is the highest point in Tianjin, with an elevation of 1,078 meters. The city's hills and mountains provide scenic views, hiking trails, and opportunities for outdoor recreation, making them popular destinations for tourists and locals alike.
