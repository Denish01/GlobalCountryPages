The city's strategic location on the coast of China made it an important trading center, and its cuisine reflects this history of cultural exchange. Tianjin's cuisine is known for its bold flavors, with a emphasis on soy sauce, ginger, and garlic. The city is also famous for its street food, with many popular dishes available at markets and from street vendors.\n\nTianjin's cuisine is also influenced by its location in the northern part of China, where wheat is a staple crop. As a result, many Tianjin dishes feature wheat-based ingredients, such as noodles and dumplings. The city is also known for its **Zhi Ma Jiang**, a type of soy sauce that is made from fermented soybeans and is a key ingredient in many Tianjin dishes.\n\nTianjin's food culture is also characterized by its emphasis on community and social gathering. Mealtimes are often seen as opportunities to bring people together, and many Tianjin dishes are designed to be shared with others. This emphasis on community is reflected in the city's many food markets and street food stalls, where people gather to eat and socialize.\n\n[SECTION] Must-Try Dishes [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Dish |
