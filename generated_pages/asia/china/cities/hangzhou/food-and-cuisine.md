In addition to its rich culinary heritage, Hangzhou is also famous for its **green tea**, which is grown in the surrounding hills and is considered one of the best teas in China.

The key to Hangzhou's culinary success lies in its emphasis on using only the freshest, highest-quality ingredients, combined with a deep understanding of traditional Chinese cooking techniques.
