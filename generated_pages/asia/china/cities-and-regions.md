[SECTION] How China Is Divided [/SECTION]
China is divided into 23 provinces, 5 autonomous regions, 4 municipalities, and 2 special administrative regions. The provinces are the primary administrative divisions, and they are further divided into prefectures, counties, and townships. The autonomous regions are granted a degree of autonomy to manage their own affairs, and they are typically inhabited by ethnic minority groups. The municipalities are directly under the central government and are typically major cities with significant economic and cultural importance. The special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau have a high degree of autonomy and are governed under the "one country, two systems" principle.

The administrative structure of China is designed to balance the needs of the central government with the needs of the local populations. The provinces and autonomous regions have a significant degree of autonomy to manage their own affairs, but they are still subject to the authority of the central government. This structure has allowed China to maintain its territorial integrity and promote economic development, while also allowing for a degree of regional diversity and autonomy.
