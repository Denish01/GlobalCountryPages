India is a vast and diverse country with a large population, while Sri Lanka is a smaller island nation with a more homogeneous culture. In terms of cost of living, India is generally cheaper than Sri Lanka, with lower prices for accommodation, food, and transportation. This is due to India's larger economy and higher competition, which drives down prices. However, Sri Lanka offers a more relaxed and peaceful environment, which may be attractive to those seeking a slower pace of life.\n\nThe economic context of both countries also plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. India has a rapidly growing economy with a large and growing middle class, which has led to increased demand for goods and services. Sri Lanka, on the other hand, has a smaller economy with a more limited range of goods and services available. This can result in higher prices for certain items, particularly imported goods. Overall, India's larger economy and higher competition make it a more affordable option for those looking to live or travel in the region.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | India (USD) | Sri Lanka (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 200 | 300 | 33% more expensive in Sri Lanka |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 150 | 250 | 40% more expensive in Sri Lanka |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 400 | 600 | 33% more expensive in Sri Lanka |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | India (USD) | Sri Lanka (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 5 | 10 | 50% more expensive in Sri Lanka |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 100 | 150 | 33% more expensive in Sri Lanka |\n| Beer (500ml) | 2 | 3 | 33% more expensive in Sri Lanka |\n| Coffee | 1 | 2 | 50% more expensive in Sri Lanka |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | India (USD) | Sri Lanka (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 20 | 30 | 33% more expensive in Sri Lanka |\n| Taxi (per km) | 0.5 | 1 | 50% more expensive in Sri Lanka |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 0.8 | 1.2 | 33% more expensive in Sri Lanka |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | India (USD) | Sri Lanka (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 50 | 80 | 38% more expensive in Sri Lanka |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 20 | 30 | 33% more expensive in Sri Lanka |\n| Mobile Plan | 10 | 15 | 33% more expensive in Sri Lanka |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | India (USD) | Sri Lanka (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 400 | 600 | 33% savings in India |\n| Mid-Range | 800 | 1,200 | 33% savings in India |\n| Comfortable | 1,200 | 1,800 | 33% savings in India |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **India is cheaper for:**\n  - Accommodation, with prices up to 40% lower than in Sri Lanka\n  - Food, with meal prices up to 50% lower than in Sri Lanka\n  - Transportation, with taxi fares and fuel prices up to 50% lower than in Sri Lanka\n  - Utilities, with prices up to 38% lower than in Sri Lanka\n- **Sri Lanka is cheaper for:**\n  - Certain imported goods, which may be more readily available in Sri Lanka\n  - Tourist activities, such as safaris and beach trips, which may be more affordable in Sri Lanka\n  - High-end dining, which may offer better value in Sri Lanka\n  - Luxury accommodation, which may be more affordable in Sri Lanka\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nIndia and Sri Lanka offer unique experiences for expats, students, and travelers.
