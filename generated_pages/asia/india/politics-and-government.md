[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of India is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **executive branch** is headed by the Prime Minister, who is the head of government, while the **President** serves as the head of state. The **legislative branch** is composed of the Parliament of India, which is a bicameral legislature consisting of the Rajya Sabha (Council of States) and the Lok Sabha (House of the People). The **judicial branch** is headed by the Supreme Court of India, which is the highest court in the country. India has a **federal system**, with power divided between the central government and the 28 states and 8 union territories. This system allows for a degree of autonomy for the states, while also providing for a strong central government.

The Indian government is based on the principles of **separation of powers**, with each branch having distinct powers and responsibilities. The executive branch is responsible for enforcing the laws, while the legislative branch is responsible for making the laws. The judicial branch is responsible for interpreting the laws and ensuring that they are in line with the Constitution of India. The government is also guided by the principles of **democracy** and **secularism**, with a commitment to protecting the rights of all citizens, regardless of their religion, caste, or creed.

The Indian political system is also characterized by a **multi-party system**, with numerous political parties operating at the national and state levels. This has led to a diverse and vibrant political landscape, with a wide range of opinions and ideologies represented. However, it has also led to challenges in terms of political stability and governance, with coalition governments and factionalism being common features of Indian politics.
