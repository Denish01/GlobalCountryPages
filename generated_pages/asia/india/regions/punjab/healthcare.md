[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in Punjab is a mix of public and private providers, with the public sector catering to the majority of the population, especially in rural areas. The public healthcare system is managed by the Punjab Government and provides free or low-cost healthcare services to citizens, including outpatient and inpatient care, diagnostic tests, and medications. However, the quality of care and facilities can vary significantly, with urban areas generally having better-equipped and staffed hospitals. Private healthcare providers, on the other hand, offer high-quality care but are often expensive and out of reach for the average citizen.

The quality of care in Punjab's healthcare system is generally considered to be good, with many well-trained doctors and medical professionals. However, there are concerns about the availability of specialized care, particularly in rural areas, and the high cost of private healthcare services. The government has implemented various initiatives to improve healthcare services, including the establishment of new hospitals and clinics, and the introduction of health insurance schemes.

Despite these efforts, there are still significant disparities in healthcare access and quality between urban and rural areas. Rural areas often have limited access to specialized care, and patients may have to travel long distances to receive treatment. Additionally, the lack of awareness and education about health issues, particularly in rural areas, can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment.
