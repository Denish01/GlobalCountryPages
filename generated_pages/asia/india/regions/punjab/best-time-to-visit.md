The summer season, which lasts from April to June, is characterized by high temperatures, often reaching up to 45 degrees Celsius. The monsoon season, which occurs from July to September, brings heavy rainfall and humidity, making it difficult to travel. The winter season, which lasts from October to March, is the coolest and most pleasant time to visit Punjab, with average temperatures ranging from 10 to 20 degrees Celsius. The climate in Punjab is influenced by its location in the **Indo-Gangetic Plain**, which makes it prone to extreme weather conditions.

The seasons in Punjab have a significant impact on travel, with the summer and monsoon seasons being the least favorable times to visit. The heat and humidity during these seasons can make it uncomfortable to explore the region's many historical and cultural sites. In contrast, the winter season is the best time to visit Punjab, as the cool weather makes it ideal for sightseeing and outdoor activities. The winter season is also the peak tourist season, with many festivals and events taking place during this time.

Punjab's climate is also influenced by its **agricultural cycle**, with the summer season being the time for harvesting and the winter season being the time for sowing. This cycle has a significant impact on the region's economy and culture, with many festivals and events being centered around the agricultural cycle. Understanding the seasons and the agricultural cycle is essential for planning a trip to Punjab, as it can help you make the most of your visit and experience the region's unique culture and traditions.
