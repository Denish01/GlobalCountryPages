[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Maharashtra, a state in western India, has a diverse climate, with different regions experiencing varying weather conditions. The state can be broadly divided into three climate zones: the coastal region, the plateau region, and the mountainous region. The coastal region, which includes cities like Mumbai and Goa, has a tropical climate, with high temperatures and high humidity throughout the year. The plateau region, which includes cities like Pune and Nashik, has a temperate climate, with cool winters and hot summers. The mountainous region, which includes the Western Ghats, has a cool climate, with mild winters and cool summers.

The dry season, which lasts from October to May, is the best time to visit Maharashtra, as the weather is cool and pleasant, making it ideal for sightseeing and outdoor activities. The wet season, which lasts from June to September, is characterized by heavy monsoon rains, which can make travel difficult and disrupt outdoor activities. However, the wet season is also a good time to visit Maharashtra if you want to experience the state's natural beauty, as the rains bring the landscape to life and make the waterfalls and lakes full.

The seasons in Maharashtra can affect travel in various ways. During the peak season, which lasts from December to January, the tourist attractions are crowded, and the prices of accommodations and tourist services are high. During the budget season, which lasts from April to June, the tourist attractions are less crowded, and the prices of accommodations and tourist services are lower. However, the weather during this time can be hot and humid, making it uncomfortable for sightseeing and outdoor activities.
