[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in Goa is a mix of public and private providers, with the public sector offering free or low-cost services, while private hospitals and clinics provide more specialized and often higher-quality care, but at a higher cost. The quality of care in Goa is generally good, especially in urban areas like Panjim and Margao, where there are several well-equipped hospitals and clinics. However, access to healthcare can be limited in rural areas, where facilities and specialized care may be scarce. The public healthcare system in Goa is overseen by the **Directorate of Health Services**, which operates several hospitals and health centers throughout the state.

The public sector provides a range of services, including primary care, emergency services, and some specialized care, but it can be overcrowded and understaffed, leading to long waiting times and variable quality of care. In contrast, private hospitals and clinics in Goa offer a wide range of specialized services, including cardiology, oncology, and orthopedics, and are often better equipped and staffed, but can be expensive. Many private hospitals in Goa cater to **medical tourists**, offering high-quality care at competitive prices.

Overall, the healthcare system in Goa is generally good, but it can be complex and variable, and patients may need to navigate both public and private sectors to access the care they need. It is recommended that visitors and expats have **health insurance** that covers them in Goa, as medical costs can be high, especially in private hospitals.
