# Best Time to Visit Goa — Month-by-Month Guide

The best time to visit Goa is from November to February, when the weather is pleasant and dry, making it ideal for outdoor activities and sightseeing. 

[CALLOUT] Best months to visit Goa: November to February. Peak season: December to January. Budget season: April to June. Avoid: May to September and July to August due to the monsoon season and high humidity. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Goa, being a coastal region in western India, has a **tropical monsoon climate** with three main seasons: dry, wet, and shoulder. The dry season, from October to May, is characterized by low humidity and warm temperatures, making it the best time to visit. The wet season, from June to September, is marked by heavy rainfall and high humidity, which can make travel and outdoor activities challenging. The shoulder season, which falls in April to June and September to November, offers a balance between the two, with mild temperatures and fewer crowds. Understanding these seasons is crucial in planning a trip to Goa, as they significantly affect travel plans, accommodation prices, and the overall experience.

The dry season is further divided into **winter** and **summer**. Winter, from November to February, is the coolest and driest period, with average temperatures ranging from 20 to 28 degrees Celsius. This is the peak tourist season, with clear skies, calm seas, and a vibrant atmosphere. Summer, from March to May, is hotter and more humid, but still relatively dry, with temperatures often reaching 30 degrees Celsius. The wet season, on the other hand, is characterized by heavy rainfall, strong winds, and rough seas, making it less ideal for tourists.

The seasons in Goa also impact the region's **beaches**, **wildlife**, and **cultural events**. During the dry season, the beaches are clean and safe for swimming, and the wildlife, including dolphins and birds, is more active. The wet season, while less tourist-friendly, brings new life to the region's flora and fauna, and the rains replenish the waterfalls and rivers. Cultural events, such as festivals and markets, are more frequent during the dry season, adding to the region's vibrancy.
