[SECTION] How Goa Is Divided [/SECTION]
Goa is a small region located on the western coast of India, and its administrative structure is relatively simple. The region is divided into two main districts: North Goa and South Goa. Each district is further subdivided into several talukas, which are similar to counties or municipalities. The districts and talukas are responsible for providing various public services, such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure, to the local population. The capital city of Panaji is located in North Goa and serves as the administrative and commercial center of the region.

The division of Goa into two districts is largely based on geographical and cultural differences. North Goa is generally more urbanized and developed, with a higher population density and a greater number of tourist attractions. South Goa, on the other hand, is more rural and laid-back, with a stronger focus on agriculture and traditional industries. This division is reflected in the different characteristics and attractions of the various cities and regions within Goa.
