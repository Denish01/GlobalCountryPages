[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Karnataka, a state in southern India, has a diverse climate, with different regions experiencing different weather patterns. The state can be broadly divided into three climate zones: the coastal region, the hill stations, and the plains. The coastal region, which includes cities like Mangalore and Udupi, has a tropical monsoon climate, with high temperatures and humidity throughout the year. The hill stations, such as Madikeri and Kemmanagundi, have a cooler climate, with mild winters and pleasant summers. The plains, which include cities like Bangalore and Mysore, have a tropical savanna climate, with hot summers and mild winters.
The dry season, which lasts from September to May, is the best time to visit Karnataka, as the weather is cool and pleasant, making it ideal for sightseeing and outdoor activities. The wet season, which lasts from June to August, is characterized by heavy rainfall and high humidity, making it less suitable for travel. However, the wet season is also a good time to visit the hill stations, as the rain brings out the beauty of the lush green landscapes.
The seasons in Karnataka also affect the travel patterns, with the peak season being from December to January, when the weather is cool and pleasant, and the festivals and events are in full swing. The budget season, which is from April to May and September to November, is a good time to visit, as the prices are lower, and the weather is still pleasant.
