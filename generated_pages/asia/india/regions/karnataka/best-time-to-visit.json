The coastal region, which includes cities like Mangalore and Udupi, has a tropical monsoon climate, with high temperatures and humidity throughout the year. The hill stations, such as Madikeri and Kemmanagundi, have a cooler climate, with mild winters and pleasant summers. The plains, which include cities like Bangalore and Mysore, have a tropical savanna climate, with hot summers and mild winters.\nThe dry season, which lasts from September to May, is the best time to visit Karnataka, as the weather is cool and pleasant, making it ideal for sightseeing and outdoor activities.
