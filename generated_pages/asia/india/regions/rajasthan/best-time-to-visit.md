[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Rajasthan, a region in northwest India, experiences a **semi-arid** climate, with very little rainfall throughout the year. The state can be divided into three main climate zones: the **desert region** of Jaisalmer and Bikaner, the **hilly region** of Udaipur and Mount Abu, and the **plains region** of Jaipur and Jodhpur. The dry season, which lasts from October to June, is characterized by very little rainfall and extreme temperature fluctuations between day and night. The wet season, which lasts from July to September, is marked by heavy rainfall and flash floods, making it difficult to travel.

The seasons in Rajasthan have a significant impact on travel, with the dry season being the best time to visit due to the pleasant weather and the wet season being the worst due to the heavy rainfall. The peak season, which coincides with the winter months, is the busiest time of the year, with tourists flocking to the state to experience the **fairs and festivals**. The budget season, which coincides with the summer months, is the best time to visit for those on a tight budget, with lower prices for accommodations and tourist attractions.

The climate of Rajasthan varies greatly depending on the region, with the desert region being the hottest and driest, the hilly region being the coolest and wettest, and the plains region being the most temperate. Understanding the climate and seasons of Rajasthan is essential for planning a trip to the state, as it can help tourists avoid the extreme heat and rainfall and make the most of their visit.
