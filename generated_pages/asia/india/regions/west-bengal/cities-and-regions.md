[SECTION] How West Bengal Is Divided [/SECTION]
West Bengal is a state located in the eastern part of India, bordered by Nepal, Bhutan, and Bangladesh. The state is divided into 23 districts, each with its own administrative headquarters and governing structure. The districts are further subdivided into blocks, which are then divided into gram panchayats and municipalities. This hierarchical structure allows for effective governance and administration of the state's vast and diverse population. The state is also home to several major cities, including Kolkata, Asansol, and Siliguri, which serve as economic and cultural hubs.

The administrative divisions of West Bengal are designed to facilitate the delivery of public services and infrastructure to the state's population. The districts are responsible for implementing state government policies and programs, while the blocks and gram panchayats focus on providing basic services such as healthcare, education, and sanitation. This decentralized approach to governance has helped to promote development and growth in the state, particularly in rural areas.
