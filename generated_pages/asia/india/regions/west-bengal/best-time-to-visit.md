The monsoon season, which lasts from June to September, is characterized by heavy rainfall and high humidity, making it difficult to travel and engage in outdoor activities. The winter season, which lasts from October to February, is cool and pleasant, with temperatures ranging from 10 to 20 degrees Celsius. The climate varies across different regions of West Bengal, with the Himalayan region in the north experiencing a colder climate, while the southern region experiences a more tropical climate.

The seasons have a significant impact on travel in West Bengal. During the summer season, many tourists avoid visiting the state due to the hot and humid weather. The monsoon season is also a low season for tourism, as the heavy rainfall and flooding can make it difficult to travel.
