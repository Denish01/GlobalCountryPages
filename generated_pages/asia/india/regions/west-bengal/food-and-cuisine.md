The use of **mustard oil** and **ghee** (clarified butter) is also characteristic of Bengali cooking. The cuisine has been shaped by various influences, including Mughal, British, and Portuguese, which is reflected in the use of spices, ingredients, and cooking techniques. Regional variations within West Bengal also exist, with the **Gaudiya** and **Bangal** sub-cultures having distinct culinary traditions.

The **Gaudiya** tradition, prevalent in the western part of the state, is known for its use of **ghee** and **yogurt**, while the **Bangal** tradition, found in the eastern part, favors **mustard oil** and **chilies**. This diversity has resulted in a rich and complex culinary landscape, with a wide range of dishes to explore. From the spicy **jhol** (curries) to the sweet **mishti** (desserts), West Bengal's cuisine has something to offer every palate.

The state's capital, Kolkata, is a food lover's paradise, with its street food, restaurants, and markets offering a wide range of culinary delights.
