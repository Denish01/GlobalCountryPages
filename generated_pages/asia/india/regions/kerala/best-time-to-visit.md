[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Kerala, a region in southern India, has a **tropical monsoon climate** with high temperatures and high humidity levels throughout the year. The state experiences two main seasons: the **dry season** from September to May and the **wet season** from June to August. The dry season is further divided into the **cool dry season** from September to February and the **hot dry season** from March to May. The wet season is characterized by heavy rainfall and high humidity, making it less ideal for travel. The dry season, on the other hand, is perfect for sightseeing and outdoor activities like hiking, wildlife spotting, and boat cruises.

The climate in Kerala varies across different regions, with the **coastal areas** experiencing a more moderate climate than the **hilly regions**. The coastal areas, including cities like Kochi and Thiruvananthapuram, have a relatively cooler climate, while the hilly regions, such as Munnar and Wayanad, have a cooler climate with lower humidity levels. The **Western Ghats**, a mountain range that runs along the eastern edge of Kerala, experiences a more extreme climate, with heavy rainfall and cooler temperatures.

The seasons in Kerala significantly affect travel, with the wet season making some areas inaccessible due to heavy rainfall and landslides. The dry season, on the other hand, is ideal for exploring the state's many **national parks**, **wildlife sanctuaries**, and **backwater regions**. The peak season, which coincides with the winter months in the Northern Hemisphere, is the busiest time of the year, with many tourists flocking to Kerala to escape the cold.
