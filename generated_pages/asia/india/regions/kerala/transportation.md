[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Kerala is well-connected to the rest of the world through its three international airports: Cochin International Airport, Calicut International Airport, and Trivandrum International Airport. These airports receive direct flights from major hubs in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Europe, making it relatively easy to get to Kerala from almost anywhere in the world. Some of the key direct flight hubs include Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Singapore, and Kuala Lumpur. Overland entry points are also available, with Kerala sharing borders with the Indian states of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, allowing for easy access by bus or train from other parts of India.

For those traveling overland, there are several entry points along the borders with Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, including the cities of Coimbatore, Madurai, and Mysore. These entry points are well-connected to Kerala's major cities, including Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi, and Kozhikode, by bus and train. Additionally, Kerala has a long coastline, with several major ports, including the Cochin Port and the Vizhinjam Port, which receive international cargo ships and cruise liners. However, for most tourists, flying into one of Kerala's international airports is the most convenient option.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Kerala has an extensive domestic air network, with flights connecting its major cities to the rest of India. Domestic airlines such as IndiGo, SpiceJet, and Air India operate frequent flights from Kerala's airports to major hubs like Delhi, Mumbai, and Chennai. Booking domestic flights in advance is recommended, especially during peak travel seasons, as prices can be quite high. Approximate costs for domestic flights can range from $50 to $200, depending on the route and airline. It's also worth noting that some airlines offer discounted fares for early morning or late evening flights, so it's worth checking the schedules and prices carefully.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Kerala has an extensive rail network, with trains connecting its major cities to the rest of India. The rail network is operated by Indian Railways, and trains range from slow-moving passenger trains to high-speed express trains. Some of the key routes include the Kerala Express, which runs from Trivandrum to New Delhi, and the Mangala Lakshadweep Express, which runs from Ernakulam to Mumbai. Booking train tickets can be done online through the Indian Railways website or at train stations, and it's recommended to book in advance, especially for popular routes. The cost of train travel can range from $10 to $100, depending on the class of travel and the route.

Kerala has a well-developed network of buses and coaches, with both government-run and private operators offering services.

Private operators like Volvo and Scania also offer luxury bus services on popular routes. The cost of bus travel can range from $5 to $50, depending on the route and class of travel. Bus travel is a convenient and affordable option for shorter distances, and many buses offer comfortable seating and air conditioning.
