Peak season: December to January. Budget season: April to May and September to November. Avoid: June to August due to heavy rainfall and high humidity. [/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]\nKerala, a region in southern India, has a **tropical monsoon climate** with high temperatures and high humidity levels throughout the year. The state experiences two main seasons: the **dry season** from September to May and the **wet season** from June to August. The dry season is further divided into the **cool dry season** from September to February and the **hot dry season** from March to May. The wet season is characterized by heavy rainfall and high humidity, making it less ideal for travel. The dry season, on the other hand, is perfect for sightseeing and outdoor activities like hiking, wildlife spotting, and boat cruises.\n\nThe climate in Kerala varies across different regions, with the **coastal areas** experiencing a more moderate climate than the **hilly regions**. The coastal areas, including cities like Kochi and Thiruvananthapuram, have a relatively cooler climate, while the hilly regions, such as Munnar and Wayanad, have a cooler climate with lower humidity levels. The **Western Ghats**, a mountain range that runs along the eastern edge of Kerala, experiences a more extreme climate, with heavy rainfall and cooler temperatures.\n\nThe seasons in Kerala significantly affect travel, with the wet season making some areas inaccessible due to heavy rainfall and landslides. The dry season, on the other hand, is ideal for exploring the state's many **national parks**, **wildlife sanctuaries**, and **backwater regions**. The peak season, which coincides with the winter months in the Northern Hemisphere, is the busiest time of the year, with many tourists flocking to Kerala to escape the cold.\n\n[SECTION] Month-by-Month Guide [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Month | Weather | Crowds | Prices | Best For |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| January | Pleasant, 22-28°C | Med | $$ | Sightseeing, outdoor activities |\n| February | Pleasant, 23-29°C | Med | $$ | Beach activities, festivals |\n| March | Hot, 25-32°C | Low | $ | Trekking, hiking |\n| April | Hot, 26-33°C | Low | $ | Visiting temples, cultural events |\n| May | Hot, 27-34°C | Low | $ | Relaxing in hill stations |\n| June | Rainy, 23-29°C | Low | $ | Ayurvedic treatments, spa retreats |\n| July | Rainy, 22-28°C | Low | $ | Visiting waterfalls, lakes |\n| August | Rainy, 23-29°C | Low | $ | Exploring rural areas |\n| September | Pleasant, 23-29°C | Med | $$ | Sightseeing, outdoor activities |\n| October | Pleasant, 24-30°C | Med | $$ | Festivals, cultural events |\n| November | Pleasant, 25-31°C | Med | $$ | Beach activities, water sports |\n| December | Pleasant, 22-28°C | High | $$$ | New Year's celebrations, peak season |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Festivals & Events Calendar [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Event | Month(s) | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Onam Festival | August-September | A traditional Kerala festival, celebrating the harvest season |\n| Vishu Festival | April | A traditional Kerala festival, marking the beginning of the new year |\n| Thrissur Pooram | April-May | A colorful festival, featuring elephant processions and fireworks |\n| Kerala Boat Festival | August-September | A series of boat races, held in different parts of the state |\n| Navaratri Festival | September-October | A nine-day festival, celebrating the divine feminine |\n| Christmas Celebrations | December | A festive celebration, marked by decorations, music, and food |\n| Munnar Winter Festival | December | A festival, showcasing the region's culture, music, and cuisine |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Variations [/SECTION]\n- The **hilly regions**, such as Munnar and Wayanad, experience a cooler climate, making them ideal for visiting during the summer months.\n- The **coastal areas**, such as Kochi and Thiruvananthapuram, experience a more moderate climate, making them ideal for visiting year-round.\n- The **backwater regions**, such as Alleppey and Kumarakom, experience a hot and humid climate, making them ideal for visiting during the cooler months.\n- The **Western Ghats**, a mountain range that runs along the eastern edge of Kerala, experience a more extreme climate, with heavy rainfall and cooler temperatures.\n- The **northern regions**, such as Kannur and Kasaragod, experience a more tropical climate, with higher temperatures and humidity levels.\n\n[SECTION] Practical Tips [/SECTION]\n- Book accommodations and tour packages well in advance, especially during the peak season.\n- Consider visiting during the shoulder season, when prices are lower and crowds are smaller.\n- Pack light, breathable clothing and comfortable shoes, suitable for the tropical climate.\n- Don't forget to bring sunscreen, sunglasses, and a hat, to protect yourself from the sun.\n- Be aware of the **Indian holidays**, such as Diwali and Holi, which can attract large crowds and higher prices.\n- Consider purchasing **travel insurance**, to cover unexpected medical or travel-related expenses.",
