[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Kerala's healthcare system is a mix of public and private providers, with a strong emphasis on preventive care and public health programs. The public healthcare system is generally well-regarded, with many government-run hospitals and clinics providing free or low-cost medical care to citizens. However, the private sector is also well-developed, with many high-quality hospitals and clinics, especially in urban areas like Thiruvananthapuram and Kochi. The quality of care in Kerala is generally excellent, with many medical professionals trained in India and abroad. Urban areas tend to have better access to healthcare services, while rural areas may have more limited options.

The government of Kerala has implemented various initiatives to improve healthcare access and quality, including the establishment of a network of community health centers and the introduction of health insurance schemes for low-income families. Despite these efforts, there are still challenges to be addressed, such as a shortage of medical professionals in certain specialties and a need for improved healthcare infrastructure in rural areas.

Kerala's healthcare system is also known for its emphasis on traditional medicine, including **Ayurveda** and **homeopathy**, which are widely practiced and recognized by the government. Many hospitals and clinics in Kerala offer integrated healthcare services, combining conventional and traditional medicine to provide holistic care to patients.
