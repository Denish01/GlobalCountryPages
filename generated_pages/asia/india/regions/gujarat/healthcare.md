[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Gujarat's healthcare system is a mix of public and private providers, with the public sector catering to the majority of the population, especially in rural areas. The quality of care varies significantly between public and private facilities, with private hospitals generally offering better amenities and specialized services. Urban areas like Ahmedabad and Vadodara have a higher concentration of quality healthcare facilities, while rural areas often struggle with limited access to specialized care and basic medical services. The government has initiated various programs to improve healthcare infrastructure and accessibility, particularly in rural areas, but there is still a significant gap in the quality of care between urban and rural regions.

The public healthcare system in Gujarat is managed by the state government, with a network of primary health centers, community health centers, and district hospitals providing basic medical services. However, these facilities often face challenges such as inadequate infrastructure, shortage of medical staff, and limited resources. In contrast, private hospitals and clinics offer a wide range of specialized services, including cardiology, oncology, and neurology, and are generally better equipped to handle complex medical cases.

Despite the challenges, Gujarat has made significant progress in improving its healthcare system, with a decline in infant mortality rates and an increase in life expectancy. The state government has also implemented various initiatives to promote health insurance and provide financial protection to families against healthcare expenses.
