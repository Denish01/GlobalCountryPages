The summer season, which lasts from March to May, is characterized by hot and dry weather, with temperatures often reaching 40°C. The monsoon season, which occurs from June to September, brings heavy rainfall and high humidity, making it a less popular time to visit. The winter season, from October to February, is the coolest and driest, with mild temperatures and clear skies, making it the best time to visit Gujarat. The state's climate can be divided into four main zones: the **Kutch region**, which is a semi-arid desert; the **Saurashtra region**, which has a tropical savanna climate; the **South Gujarat region**, which has a tropical monsoon climate; and the **North Gujarat region**, which has a semi-arid climate.\n\nThe seasons in Gujarat have a significant impact on travel, with the summer and monsoon seasons making outdoor activities and sightseeing challenging. The winter season, on the other hand, is ideal for visiting Gujarat's many **beaches**, **temples**, and **wildlife sanctuaries**. The state's many festivals and events, such as the **Navratri** and **Uttarayan**, also take place during the winter season, making it a great time to experience Gujarat's rich culture.\n\nGujarat's climate and seasons also affect the state's **agriculture** and **economy**, with the monsoon season being crucial for the state's agricultural production. The summer season, on the other hand, can be challenging for farmers, with the hot and dry weather affecting crop yields.
