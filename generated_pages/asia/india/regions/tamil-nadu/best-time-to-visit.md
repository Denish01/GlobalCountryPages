[CALLOUT] Best months to visit Tamil Nadu: October to February. Peak season: December to January. Budget season: April to June. Avoid: July to September due to the hot and humid weather, and the possibility of cyclones and heavy rainfall. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Tamil Nadu has a tropical climate, with four distinct seasons: winter, summer, monsoon, and post-monsoon. The winter season, from October to February, is the coolest and driest period, with average temperatures ranging from 20°C to 25°C. The summer season, from March to May, is hot and humid, with temperatures often reaching 35°C. The monsoon season, from June to September, is characterized by heavy rainfall and cyclones, making it a challenging time to travel. The post-monsoon season, from October to December, is a transitional period, with the weather gradually becoming cooler and drier.

The climate in Tamil Nadu varies across different regions, with the coastal areas tend to be hotter and more humid than the inland regions. The Western Ghats mountain range, which runs along the western edge of the state, creates a rain shadow effect, resulting in a drier climate in the western regions. The Eastern Ghats, on the other hand, receive more rainfall, making the eastern regions more prone to flooding during the monsoon season.

The seasons in Tamil Nadu have a significant impact on travel, with the winter season being the best time to visit the region's many temples, beaches, and hill stations. The summer season is ideal for visiting the cooler hill stations, such as Ooty and Kodaikanal, while the monsoon season is best avoided due to the heavy rainfall and cyclones.
