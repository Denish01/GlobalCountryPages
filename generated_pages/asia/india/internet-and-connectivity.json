However, there is still a notable urban-rural divide, with cities like Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore enjoying faster and more reliable connections, while rural areas often struggle with slower speeds and limited access. The reliability of the internet in India can also vary, with outages and disruptions more common in certain regions, particularly during periods of heavy rainfall or construction.\n\nDespite these challenges, India has made significant strides in expanding its internet infrastructure, with many major cities now offering fast and reliable connections. The government has also launched initiatives to improve internet access in rural areas, including the establishment of community internet centers and the expansion of mobile networks. As a result, the internet is now more accessible than ever in India, with a growing number of people using online services for everything from communication and entertainment to education and commerce.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nGetting a SIM card in India is a relatively straightforward process, with many options available for tourists and travelers. You can purchase a SIM card at the airport, at a mobile phone store, or at a local market. To buy a SIM card, you will need to provide a valid passport and a proof of address, such as a hotel reservation or a driver's license. The cost of a SIM card can vary, but you can expect to pay around 2-5 USD for a tourist SIM.
