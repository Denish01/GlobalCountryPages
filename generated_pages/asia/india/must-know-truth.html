        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>India, officially known as the Republic of India, has a rich and diverse history that spans thousands of years. The <strong>Indus Valley Civilization</strong>, which dates back to 3300 BCE, is considered one of the earliest urban civilizations in the world. The country was later invaded by various empires, including the <strong>Mauryan Empire</strong> in 322 BCE and the <strong>Mughal Empire</strong> in 1526 CE. The <strong>British East India Company</strong> established its presence in India in 1612, and by the mid-19th century, the British had colonized most of the country. India gained independence from British rule on <strong>August 15, 1947</strong>, after a long and complex struggle led by figures such as <strong>Mahatma Gandhi</strong> and <strong>Jawaharlal Nehru</strong>.</p>
        <p>The <strong>Indian Independence Act</strong> of 1947 divided British India into two separate countries: India and Pakistan. The partition of India and Pakistan resulted in one of the largest mass migrations in history, with millions of people moving across the newly drawn borders. The country has since become a <strong>sovereign</strong> nation, with a <strong>parliamentary system</strong> of government and a <strong>presidential</strong> head of state. India has also been a member of the <strong>United Nations</strong> since 1945 and has played an active role in international affairs.</p>
        <p>India's history is also marked by a number of significant events, including the <strong>Indian Rebellion of 1857</strong>, the <strong>Non-Cooperation Movement</strong> of 1920-1922, and the <strong>Quit India Movement</strong> of 1942. The country has also experienced significant economic and social changes, including the <strong>Green Revolution</strong> of the 1960s and the <strong>economic liberalization</strong> of the 1990s. Today, India is a rapidly growing economy and a major player in global affairs.</p>

India is home to a number of <strong>UNESCO World Heritage Sites</strong>, including the <strong>Taj Mahal</strong> and the <strong>Red Fort</strong>.
