However, costs can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher electricity bills during the summer months due to increased air conditioning usage. The Indian government has implemented various initiatives to promote energy efficiency and reduce consumption, which has helped to stabilize costs to some extent.\n\nThe quality of utility infrastructure varies across different regions, with urban areas generally having better access to reliable electricity, water, and gas supplies. In contrast, rural areas often face challenges such as power outages and limited access to clean water. The Indian government has launched initiatives to improve rural infrastructure, including the Saubhagya scheme, which aims to provide electricity to all households by 2025. Despite these efforts, seasonal variation in utility costs remains a significant factor, with bills tend to be higher during the summer and winter months.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $30 | $50 | $70 | rates vary by state |\n| Water | $10 | $15 | $20 | municipal supplies |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $15 | $20 | LPG cylinder costs |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $5 | $5 | $5 | (if separate) |\n| **Total** | **$55** | **$85** | **$115** |  |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $10-$20 | 30 Mbps | Jio, Airtel, BSNL |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $20-$50 | 100 Mbps | Jio, Airtel, Tata |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $3-$10 | 1-10 GB | Jio, Airtel, Vodafone |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $10-$30 | 10-50 GB | Jio, Airtel, Vodafone |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $20-$50 | varies | Jio, Airtel, BSNL |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 |  |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 |  |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | Hotstar, ZEE5 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities, it's best to contact the local provider directly, such as the electricity board or water supply department.\n- Prepaid electricity meters are becoming increasingly popular, as they allow users to pay for their energy usage in advance and avoid bill shocks.\n- For internet services, Jio and Airtel are popular providers, offering a range of plans with varying speeds and data allowances.\n- To save on utility bills, consider using energy-efficient appliances, turning off lights and electronics when not in use, and using public transport or carpooling to reduce fuel consumption.\n- It's also a good idea to compare prices and plans from different providers to find the best deals, and to take advantage of promotional offers and discounts whenever possible.",
