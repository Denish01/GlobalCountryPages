# India History — Key Events & Timeline

The history of India is a vast and complex narrative spanning over 5,000 years, from the ancient **Indus Valley Civilization** to the modern era of a sovereign nation.

[SECTION] Historical Overview [/SECTION]
The history of India began with the **Indus Valley Civilization**, which dates back to around 3300 BCE and is considered one of the oldest civilizations in the world. This civilization was known for its advanced urban planning, architecture, and water management systems. The **Vedic Period**, which followed, saw the rise of Hinduism and the development of the **Vedas**, ancient Hindu scriptures. The **Mauryan Empire**, which ruled from 322 BCE to 185 BCE, was a significant period in Indian history, marked by the reign of **Ashoka the Great**, who converted to Buddhism and spread it throughout his empire. The **Mughal Empire**, which ruled from 1526 to 1756, was a period of significant cultural and architectural development, marked by the construction of iconic landmarks such as the **Taj Mahal**.

The **British East India Company** arrived in India in the early 17th century, and by the mid-19th century, the British had established their rule over the entire subcontinent.
