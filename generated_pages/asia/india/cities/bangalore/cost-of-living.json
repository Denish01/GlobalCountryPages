[/SECTION]\nBangalore, also known as the Silicon Valley of India, is a major city in the southern part of the country. Compared to other major cities in India, Bangalore has a relatively high cost of living, but it is still considered affordable compared to many Western cities. The cost of living in Bangalore is influenced by its thriving tech industry, which has led to an influx of professionals and entrepreneurs, driving up prices for housing, food, and other amenities. However, compared to other major cities in Asia, such as Singapore or Hong Kong, Bangalore is still a relatively affordable option.\n\nIn terms of global averages, Bangalore is generally cheaper than many cities in the West, but more expensive than some other cities in India. For example, the cost of a meal in a mid-range restaurant in Bangalore is around $5-10 USD per person, which is relatively affordable compared to many Western cities. However, the cost of housing in Bangalore can be high, especially in areas close to the city center, with prices for a one-bedroom apartment starting from around $200-300 USD per month.\n\n[SECTION] Accommodation Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Price Range (USD/night) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Hostel/Budget | $5-15 | basic amenities, shared rooms |\n| Mid-Range Hotel | $20-50 | air-conditioned rooms, free Wi-Fi |\n| Luxury/Resort | $100-250 | high-end amenities, swimming pool, gym |\n| Apartment Rent (monthly) | $200-500 | city center, 1-2 bedrooms, furnished |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $1-3 |\n| Casual Restaurant | $5-10 |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $15-30 |\n| Fine Dining | $50-100 |\n| Beer (local) | $2-5 |\n| Coffee | $1-3 |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $0.50-1 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport | Cost (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Local bus/metro ride | $0.20-0.50 |\n| Taxi (per km) | $0.50-1 |\n| Domestic flight | $50-200 |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $0.70-1 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Breakdown [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Category | Budget ($) | Mid-Range ($) | Comfortable ($) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rent | 200-300 | 400-600 | 800-1,200 |\n| Food | 150-250 | 300-500 | 600-1,000 |\n| Transport | 50-100 | 100-200 | 200-300 |\n| Utilities | 50-100 | 100-200 | 200-300 |\n| Entertainment | 100-200 | 200-400 | 400-600 |\n| **Total** | **600-1,050** | **1,200-2,000** | **2,400-3,800** |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Money-Saving Tips [/SECTION]\n- Consider sharing an apartment with roommates to split the rent and utilities.\n- Eat at local eateries or street food stalls, which offer affordable and delicious options.\n- Use public transport, such as buses or the metro, which are cheap and efficient.\n- Avoid traveling during peak hours to save on transport costs.\n- Take advantage of happy hour deals or discounts at bars and restaurants.\n- Use cash instead of credit cards to avoid foreign transaction fees.",
