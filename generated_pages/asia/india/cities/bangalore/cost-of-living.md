[SECTION] How Expensive Is Bangalore? [/SECTION]
Bangalore, also known as the Silicon Valley of India, is a major city in the southern part of the country. Compared to other major cities in India, Bangalore has a relatively high cost of living, but it is still considered affordable compared to many Western cities. The cost of living in Bangalore is influenced by its thriving tech industry, which has led to an influx of professionals and entrepreneurs, driving up prices for housing, food, and other amenities. However, compared to other major cities in Asia, such as Singapore or Hong Kong, Bangalore is still a relatively affordable option.

In terms of global averages, Bangalore is generally cheaper than many cities in the West, but more expensive than some other cities in India. For example, the cost of a meal in a mid-range restaurant in Bangalore is around $5-10 USD per person, which is relatively affordable compared to many Western cities. However, the cost of housing in Bangalore can be high, especially in areas close to the city center, with prices for a one-bedroom apartment starting from around $200-300 USD per month.
