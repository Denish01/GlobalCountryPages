Delhi is a landlocked city, with no direct access to the sea, but it is connected to the rest of the country through a network of roads, railways, and airways. The city's strategic location has made it an important center for trade, commerce, and culture in the region.\n\nDelhi is also close to several major cities in the region, including Agra, Jaipur, and Chandigarh, making it a popular tourist destination.

The city is situated on the **Gangetic Plain**, which is one of the most fertile and densely populated regions in the world.

The city's **Mughal architecture**, which includes monuments such as the Red Fort and the Jama Masjid, is a significant part of its cultural heritage.
