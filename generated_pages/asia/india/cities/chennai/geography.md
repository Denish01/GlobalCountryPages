[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Chennai is situated on the southeastern coast of India, bordering the Bay of Bengal to the east, and is part of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. The city is bounded by the Ennore Creek to the north, the Buckingham Canal to the south, and the Adyar River to the south. Chennai is a major urban center in southern India, and its strategic location on the coast has made it an important port city and a hub for trade and commerce. The city's proximity to the Bay of Bengal also makes it prone to cyclones and storms during the monsoon season.

Chennai is surrounded by several smaller towns and cities, including Tiruvallur to the northwest, Kanchipuram to the southwest, and Villupuram to the south. The city is also close to the Union Territory of Puducherry, which is located about 160 km to the south. Chennai's location on the coast has made it an important center for maritime trade and commerce, and its proximity to several major ports has contributed to its growth as a major economic hub in southern India.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Chennai's terrain is generally flat, with an average elevation of about 6 meters above sea level. The city is situated on the eastern coastal plain of India, which is a narrow strip of land that runs along the Bay of Bengal. The coastal plain is bounded by the Eastern Ghats mountain range to the west, which rises steeply to an elevation of over 1,000 meters. The city's terrain is also marked by several rivers, including the Adyar River, the Cooum River, and the Kosasthalaiyar River, which flow through the city and empty into the Bay of Bengal.

Chennai's landscape is dominated by urban development, with several major roads, highways, and expressways that connect the city to other parts of India. The city is also home to several major parks and gardens, including the Guindy National Park, which is one of the smallest national parks in India. The park is home to several species of flora and fauna, including the blackbuck, the spotted deer, and the Indian python. Chennai's terrain and landscape have been shaped by its location on the coast, and the city's growth and development have been influenced by its proximity to the sea.

The city's coastal location has also made it prone to erosion and flooding, particularly during the monsoon season. The city's government has implemented several measures to mitigate the effects of erosion and flooding, including the construction of seawalls and the creation of artificial beaches. Despite these challenges, Chennai's unique terrain and landscape have made it a popular destination for tourists and travelers, who come to the city to experience its rich cultural heritage and its stunning natural beauty.
