The city has a low rate of violent crime, and most crimes reported are petty in nature, such as pickpocketing or street scams. However, as with any major city, tourists should be aware of their surroundings, especially in crowded areas or at night. The city has a dedicated tourist police force, which is available to assist visitors in case of any issues.\n\nDespite the overall safety of the city, there are some areas that tourists should avoid, especially at night. The city's old town, known as the \"walled city,\" can be quite crowded and narrow, and it's easy to get lost or caught up in a scam.
