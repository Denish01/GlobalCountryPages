[SECTION] Overall Safety Assessment [/SECTION]
Hyderabad is a bustling city with a rich cultural heritage, and it is generally considered safe for tourists. The city has a low rate of violent crime, and most crimes reported are petty in nature, such as pickpocketing or street scams. However, as with any major city, tourists should be aware of their surroundings, especially in crowded areas or at night. The city has a dedicated tourist police force, which is available to assist visitors in case of any issues.

Despite the overall safety of the city, there are some areas that tourists should avoid, especially at night. The city's old town, known as the "walled city," can be quite crowded and narrow, and it's easy to get lost or caught up in a scam. Additionally, some areas of the city are known to have higher crime rates, such as the outskirts of the city or areas with high concentrations of street vendors. However, these areas are generally not frequented by tourists, and most visitors to the city can avoid them altogether.
