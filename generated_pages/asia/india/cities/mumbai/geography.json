The city is bordered by the Thane District to the north, the Raigad District to the south, and the Arabian Sea to the west. Mumbai is an island city, with the mainland connected to the island by bridges and causeways. The city's unique location on the coast has made it an important port and trade center for centuries.\n\nThe city's proximity to the sea has also influenced its climate and geography. The Arabian Sea has a moderating effect on the climate, keeping temperatures relatively mild throughout the year. The city is also close to the Western Ghats mountain range, which runs along the western coast of India. The Western Ghats have a significant impact on the climate and geography of the region, with the mountains creating a rain shadow effect that affects the amount of rainfall the city receives.\n\n[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]\nMumbai's terrain is characterized by a flat to gently sloping landscape, with an average elevation of about 10-15 meters above sea level. The city is situated on a narrow strip of land, with the Arabian Sea to the west and the Thane Creek to the east. The city's landscape is dominated by urban development, with towering skyscrapers, busy streets, and crowded markets. However, the city also has several natural areas, including beaches, parks, and gardens, which provide a respite from the hustle and bustle of city life.\n\nThe city's coastline is approximately 149 km long, with several beaches, bays, and harbors. The most notable beaches in Mumbai include Juhu Beach, Versova Beach, and Girgaum Chowpatty. The city's coastline is also home to several important ports, including the Mumbai Port and the Jawaharlal Nehru Port. The ports are major economic hubs, with cargo ships and tankers coming and going throughout the day.\n\nMumbai is also home to several rivers, including the Mithi River, the Ulhas River, and the Vaitarna River.
