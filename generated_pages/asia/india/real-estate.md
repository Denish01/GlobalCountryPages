[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The Indian property market is a complex and diverse sector, with varying trends and conditions across different regions. The market has experienced significant growth in recent years, driven by urbanization, economic development, and government initiatives to boost the sector. However, the market has also faced challenges such as oversupply, high prices, and regulatory issues. Currently, the market is experiencing a slowdown, with prices stabilizing and developers focusing on affordable housing and mid-segment projects. The urban property market is more developed, with modern amenities and infrastructure, while the rural market is largely underdeveloped, with limited access to basic services.

The price trajectory of the Indian property market has been upward, with prices increasing significantly over the past decade. However, the pace of growth has slowed down in recent years, and prices have stabilized in many cities. The market is expected to remain stable, with gradual growth in the coming years. The government has introduced several initiatives to boost the sector, including the **Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016**, which aims to regulate the market and protect consumer interests.

The Indian property market can be broadly classified into urban and rural segments. The urban segment is more developed, with modern amenities and infrastructure, while the rural segment is largely underdeveloped, with limited access to basic services. The urban segment is driven by demand from the growing middle class, while the rural segment is driven by agricultural and rural development initiatives. The government has introduced several initiatives to boost rural development, including the **Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana** (PMAY) scheme, which aims to provide affordable housing to rural households.
