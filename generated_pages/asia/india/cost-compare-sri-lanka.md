[SECTION] Overview: India vs Sri Lanka [/SECTION]
India and Sri Lanka are two neighboring countries in South Asia that offer unique cultural and economic experiences. India is a vast and diverse country with a large population, while Sri Lanka is a smaller island nation with a more homogeneous culture. In terms of cost of living, India is generally cheaper than Sri Lanka, with lower prices for accommodation, food, and transportation. This is due to India's larger economy and higher competition, which drives down prices. However, Sri Lanka offers a more relaxed and peaceful environment, which may be attractive to those seeking a slower pace of life.

The economic context of both countries also plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. India has a rapidly growing economy with a large and growing middle class, which has led to increased demand for goods and services.

Overall, India's larger economy and higher competition make it a more affordable option for those looking to live or travel in the region.
