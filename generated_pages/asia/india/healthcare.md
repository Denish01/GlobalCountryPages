[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
India's healthcare system is a complex network of public and private providers, with a significant disparity in quality and accessibility between urban and rural areas. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and overcrowded, while private hospitals and clinics offer high-quality care, often at a significant cost. The **National Health Mission** aims to improve healthcare access and quality, particularly in rural areas, but much work remains to be done. In urban areas, patients have access to a wide range of medical facilities, including specialized hospitals and clinics, while rural areas often rely on basic primary health centers. Despite these challenges, India has made significant progress in improving healthcare outcomes, with notable reductions in **maternal mortality** and **child mortality** rates.

The Indian government has implemented various initiatives to improve healthcare access, including the **Ayushman Bharat** scheme, which provides health insurance coverage to millions of low-income families. However, the healthcare system still faces significant challenges, including a shortage of skilled healthcare professionals, inadequate infrastructure, and a lack of access to specialized care in rural areas. To address these challenges, the government has launched initiatives to increase the number of medical schools and training programs, as well as to improve the quality of care in public hospitals.

In addition to these initiatives, India has also seen a growth in **telemedicine** services, which aim to increase access to healthcare, particularly in rural areas. These services allow patients to consult with doctors remotely, reducing the need for travel and improving access to specialized care. While these initiatives have shown promise, more work is needed to address the significant disparities in healthcare access and quality that exist across the country.
