[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
India's infrastructure development has been rapidly advancing over the past decade, with significant investments in roads, railways, airports, and ports. The country has made substantial progress in improving its overall infrastructure, with a focus on increasing connectivity, enhancing the quality of services, and promoting economic growth. However, despite these efforts, India still faces significant challenges in terms of the urban-rural gap, with many rural areas lacking access to basic infrastructure such as reliable electricity, clean water, and sanitation. Recent investments in infrastructure have been driven by government initiatives, such as the **National Infrastructure Pipeline**, which aims to invest over $1.5 trillion in infrastructure development by 2025.

The Indian government has also launched several initiatives to improve the country's infrastructure, including the **Smart Cities Mission**, which aims to develop 100 smart cities across the country, and the **Bharatmala Pariyojana**, a $107 billion road development program. These initiatives have helped to improve the overall quality of infrastructure in India, but more needs to be done to address the significant gaps that still exist, particularly in rural areas. India's infrastructure development is also being driven by the need to support its rapidly growing economy, which is expected to become the third-largest in the world by 2030.

The government's focus on infrastructure development is also reflected in its efforts to improve the business environment and attract foreign investment. India has made significant progress in improving its **ease of doing business** rankings, and the country has become an attractive destination for foreign investors. However, infrastructure remains a major challenge, and the government needs to continue to invest in improving the quality of its infrastructure to support economic growth and development.
