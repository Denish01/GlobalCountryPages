[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
India's population size is a significant aspect of its demographics, with the country accounting for approximately 18% of the world's population. The population growth rate has been declining over the years, from 1.8% in 1990 to 1.2% in 2020, due to factors such as declining fertility rates and increasing urbanization. The urban population has been growing rapidly, with an estimated 34.5% of the population living in urban areas, and this trend is expected to continue in the coming years. Migration patterns in India are complex, with people moving from rural to urban areas in search of better economic opportunities, as well as from one state to another for education, employment, or other reasons.

The population of India is projected to continue growing, although at a slower rate, and is expected to reach 1.5 billion by 2025. The government has implemented various policies to manage population growth, including family planning programs and education initiatives. Despite these efforts, the population is still growing, and this has put a strain on the country's resources, infrastructure, and environment. The impact of population growth on the environment is a significant concern, with increasing demands on water, energy, and land resources.

The demographics of India are also influenced by factors such as education and healthcare. The literacy rate in India has been increasing, with approximately 74% of the population able to read and write. However, there are still significant disparities in education and healthcare between urban and rural areas, as well as between different states. The government has implemented various initiatives to improve education and healthcare, including programs to increase access to schools and hospitals, as well as initiatives to improve the quality of education and healthcare services.
