[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
India's rental market is highly competitive, with a wide range of options available to suit different budgets and preferences. Typical lease terms in India range from 11 to 22 months, with a security deposit equivalent to 2-3 months' rent. Tenant rights are protected under the Indian law, but it is essential to carefully review the rental agreement before signing. Compared to its regional neighbors, India's housing costs are relatively moderate, with cities like Mumbai and Delhi being more expensive than others like Bangalore and Hyderabad. The rental market in India is also influenced by factors like proximity to public transportation, schools, and amenities, which can impact the rent prices.

The housing market in India is also characterized by a significant shortage of affordable housing, particularly in urban areas. This has led to a surge in demand for rental properties, driving up prices in some cities. However, the government has implemented various initiatives to increase the supply of affordable housing and reduce the burden on renters. For example, the **Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana** (PMAY) scheme aims to provide affordable housing to millions of Indians by 2022. Despite these efforts, the housing market in India remains complex, and renters need to be aware of the local conditions and regulations to navigate it effectively.
