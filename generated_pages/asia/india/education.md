[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in India is divided into three main stages: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Primary education, also known as **lower secondary**, typically lasts for five years and is followed by secondary education, which lasts for seven years. The secondary stage is further divided into two sub-stages: **upper secondary** and **senior secondary**. The quality of education in India varies greatly depending on the institution and location, with private schools generally offering better facilities and more qualified teachers than public schools. The public education system is free and compulsory for all children between the ages of 6 and 14, but the quality of education can be inconsistent.

The education system in India is also characterized by a strong emphasis on **technical and vocational training**, with many institutions offering courses in fields such as engineering, medicine, and computer science. However, the system has been criticized for its focus on rote learning and lack of emphasis on critical thinking and creativity. Despite these challenges, India has made significant progress in increasing access to education, particularly for girls and women, and has implemented various initiatives to improve the quality of education.

The education system in India is overseen by the **Ministry of Education**, which is responsible for setting national education policies and standards. The ministry has implemented various reforms in recent years, including the introduction of a new **National Education Policy**, which aims to promote **equity and inclusion** in education and improve the overall quality of the system.
