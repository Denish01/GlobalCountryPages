[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
India's education system is a mix of public and private institutions, with a significant emphasis on public education. The public education system in India is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to private schools, with limited resources and large class sizes. However, public schools are free or heavily subsidized, making them accessible to a large portion of the population. The language of instruction in most Indian schools is English, although some schools may use the local language as the primary medium of instruction. Compulsory education in India lasts for 12 years, from primary to higher secondary school. International schools are also available in major cities, offering a range of curricula such as the International Baccalaureate (IB), Cambridge International Examinations (CIE), and the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE).

The quality of education in India varies significantly depending on the institution and location. Private schools and international institutions generally offer higher quality education, with better infrastructure, smaller class sizes, and more qualified teachers. However, these institutions are often expensive and out of reach for many Indians. Public schools, on the other hand, struggle with limited resources, large class sizes, and inadequate infrastructure. Despite these challenges, India has made significant progress in increasing access to education, with enrollment rates increasing significantly over the past few decades.
