[SECTION] Overview: India vs Pakistan [/SECTION]
India and Pakistan are two neighboring countries in South Asia with distinct economic profiles. India has a larger and more diverse economy, with a GDP per capita of over 7,300 USD, while Pakistan's GDP per capita is around 6,000 USD. The cost of living in India is generally lower, with a difference of around 10-20% compared to Pakistan. This is reflected in various categories such as housing, food, and transportation. However, it's essential to note that costs can vary significantly depending on the location, with cities like Mumbai and Delhi in India being more expensive than similar cities in Pakistan.

The economic context of both countries also plays a role in shaping their cost of living. India has a more developed economy with a stronger service sector, while Pakistan's economy is more reliant on agriculture and manufacturing. This difference in economic structure contributes to the variation in costs between the two countries. Additionally, the exchange rates and inflation rates also impact the cost of living, with India's lower inflation rate contributing to its relatively lower costs.
