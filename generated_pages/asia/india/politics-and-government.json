The **executive branch** is headed by the Prime Minister, who is the head of government, while the **President** serves as the head of state. The **legislative branch** is composed of the Parliament of India, which is a bicameral legislature consisting of the Rajya Sabha (Council of States) and the Lok Sabha (House of the People). The **judicial branch** is headed by the Supreme Court of India, which is the highest court in the country. India has a **federal system**, with power divided between the central government and the 28 states and 8 union territories. This system allows for a degree of autonomy for the states, while also providing for a strong central government.\n\nThe Indian government is based on the principles of **separation of powers**, with each branch having distinct powers and responsibilities. The executive branch is responsible for enforcing the laws, while the legislative branch is responsible for making the laws.
