[/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nIndia has a moderate visa policy, with a mix of visa-free access, visa on arrival, and pre-arranged visa requirements for different nationalities. Citizens of a few countries, such as Nepal, Bhutan, and Sri Lanka, enjoy visa-free access to India, while many others can obtain a visa on arrival or an e-visa. The Indian government has been actively promoting tourism and business travel in recent years, simplifying the visa application process and introducing new types of visas, such as the e-tourist visa and the business e-visa.\n\nThe Indian visa policy is designed to balance the need to facilitate travel and trade with the need to maintain national security and control over immigration. As a result, the visa requirements and regulations can be complex and subject to change. It is essential to check the official government website or consult with the Indian embassy or consulate in your home country for the latest information on visa requirements and application procedures.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | Yes | Tourist/eVisa | 60 days | Can apply for e-visa online |\n| UK Citizens | Yes | Tourist/eVisa | 60 days | Can apply for e-visa online |\n| EU Citizens | Yes | Tourist/eVisa | 60 days | Can apply for e-visa online |\n| Canadian Citizens | Yes | Tourist/eVisa | 60 days | Can apply for e-visa online |\n| Australian Citizens | Yes | Tourist/eVisa | 60 days | Can apply for e-visa online |\n| Indian Citizens | No | - | - | Not applicable |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Tourist/Regular Visa | 30 days | Must apply for regular visa at Indian embassy or consulate |\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can apply for an e-visa online, which is valid for 60 days and allows multiple entries.

The business visa is usually valid for one year, with multiple entries allowed. Business travelers must also register with the Foreigners' Registration Office (FRO) within 14 days of arrival.\n**Students:** Students must apply for a student visa, which requires proof of enrollment in an Indian educational institution, a letter of admission, and a proof of financial support. The student visa is usually valid for the duration of the course, with extensions possible in exceptional cases.\n**Workers:** Workers must apply for a work visa, which requires a sponsorship letter from an Indian employer and a contract of employment.

The immigration process typically involves presenting a valid passport, visa (if required), and completing a disembarkation card. Travelers may also be required to declare certain items, such as cash, electronics, or gifts, and may be subject to a baggage screening. Land borders are also open for entry, with major border crossing points at Wagah (Pakistan), Nathu La (China), and Moreh (Myanmar).\n\nUpon arrival, travelers must proceed to the immigration counter and present their travel documents. The immigration officer may ask questions about the purpose of the visit, the length of stay, and the accommodation arrangements. Travelers must also obtain a stamp in their passport, which serves as proof of entry into India. In some cases, travelers may be required to register with the FRO within 14 days of arrival, especially if they plan to stay in India for an extended period.\n\n[SECTION] Common Mistakes To Avoid [/SECTION]\n- Not checking the validity of the passport before traveling to India\n- Not applying for the correct type of visa or not applying in time\n- Not having sufficient funds or a return ticket\n- Not declaring certain items, such as cash or electronics, at the border\n- Not registering with the FRO within the required timeframe\n- Not carrying a copy of the visa application and supporting documents",
