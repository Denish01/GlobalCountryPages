Typical lease terms in India range from 11 to 22 months, with a security deposit equivalent to 2-3 months' rent. Tenant rights are protected under the Indian law, but it is essential to carefully review the rental agreement before signing. Compared to its regional neighbors, India's housing costs are relatively moderate, with cities like Mumbai and Delhi being more expensive than others like Bangalore and Hyderabad. The rental market in India is also influenced by factors like proximity to public transportation, schools, and amenities, which can impact the rent prices.\n\nThe housing market in India is also characterized by a significant shortage of affordable housing, particularly in urban areas. This has led to a surge in demand for rental properties, driving up prices in some cities. However, the government has implemented various initiatives to increase the supply of affordable housing and reduce the burden on renters. For example, the **Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana** (PMAY) scheme aims to provide affordable housing to millions of Indians by 2022. Despite these efforts, the housing market in India remains complex, and renters need to be aware of the local conditions and regulations to navigate it effectively.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $150-$300 | $100-$200 | Basic amenities, 1-2 rooms |\n| 1 Bedroom | $250-$450 | $150-$300 | Furnished, 1 bathroom, kitchenette |\n| 2 Bedroom | $400-$700 | $250-$500 | Family size, 2 bathrooms, living room |\n| 3 Bedroom | $600-$1,200 | $400-$800 | Spacious, 3 bathrooms, large living room |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $1,500-$3,000 | Prime locations, luxury amenities |\n| Suburbs | $800-$1,500 | Residential areas, basic amenities |\n| Rural | $200-$500 | Limited amenities, rural areas |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Hauz Khas** in Delhi: $400-$800 USD/month, trendy neighborhood with restaurants and bars\n- **Bandra** in Mumbai: $500-$1,000 USD/month, upscale neighborhood with sea views\n- **Indiranagar** in Bangalore: $300-$600 USD/month, cosmopolitan neighborhood with restaurants and shops\n- **Golf Course Road** in Gurgaon: $400-$800 USD/month, modern neighborhood with amenities\n- **Alwarpet** in Chennai: $250-$500 USD/month, quiet neighborhood with historic charm\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for India [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods thoroughly to find the best fit for your budget and lifestyle\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent to avoid scams and find legitimate properties\n- Negotiate the rent and terms of the lease before signing the agreement\n- Be aware of the **security deposit** and **brokerage fees** involved in renting a property\n- Check if utilities like electricity, water, and gas are included in the rent or need to be paid separately\n- Consider **furnished** or **semi-furnished** apartments to avoid the hassle of setting up a new home\n- [CALLOUT] Be cautious of **rental scams** and never pay a deposit without verifying the property and landlord's credentials\n- [RATING] India's rental market: 3/5, with a wide range of options available but also some challenges to navigate.",
