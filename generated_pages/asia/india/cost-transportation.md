[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
India has a diverse range of transportation modes, including buses, trains, taxis, and ride-hailing services. The quality of public transit varies greatly between cities, with major cities like New Delhi and Mumbai having well-developed public transportation systems, while smaller cities and rural areas may have more limited options. Most people in India get around using public transportation, with buses and trains being the most affordable and widely available options. However, the increasing popularity of ride-hailing services has also made it easier for people to get around, especially in urban areas.

In addition to public transportation, many Indians also use **two-wheelers** and **three-wheelers**, such as autorickshaws and motorcycles, to get around. These vehicles are affordable and convenient, but can also be hazardous, especially in cities with heavy traffic. The Indian government has been investing in improving the country's transportation infrastructure, including the development of new metro lines and highways, which is expected to improve the overall quality of transportation in the country.
