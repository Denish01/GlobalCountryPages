The quality of public transit varies greatly between cities, with major cities like New Delhi and Mumbai having well-developed public transportation systems, while smaller cities and rural areas may have more limited options. Most people in India get around using public transportation, with buses and trains being the most affordable and widely available options. However, the increasing popularity of ride-hailing services has also made it easier for people to get around, especially in urban areas.\n\nIn addition to public transportation, many Indians also use **two-wheelers** and **three-wheelers**, such as autorickshaws and motorcycles, to get around. These vehicles are affordable and convenient, but can also be hazardous, especially in cities with heavy traffic. The Indian government has been investing in improving the country's transportation infrastructure, including the development of new metro lines and highways, which is expected to improve the overall quality of transportation in the country.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.20-0.50 | $10-20 | Good coverage in major cities, limited in rural areas |\n| Metro / Subway | $0.30-0.60 | $15-30 | Available in major cities like New Delhi, Mumbai, and Bangalore |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $0.50-1.00 | N/A | Common in smaller cities and rural areas, routes may vary |\n| Commuter Train | $1.00-2.00 | $20-50 | Available in major cities, good for long-distance commutes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $1.50 | $0.25 | $5-10 | Available in most cities, but may not always use meters |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $1.00 | $0.15 | $3-6 | Ola and Uber are widely available, fares may vary depending on traffic |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $10-20 | Prepaid taxi booths available at airports, or book through ride-hailing apps |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20 | Prices may vary depending on location and taxes |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.10 | Prices may vary depending on location and taxes |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $20-50 | Economy cars available, prices may vary depending on location and rental agency |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-3 | Prices may vary depending on location and availability |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $2-5 | Some highways and expressways have tolls, prices may vary depending on route |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $5-15 | Prices may vary depending on bus operator and route |\n| Domestic Flight | $50-150 | Prices may vary depending on airline, route, and time of booking |\n| Train (long-distance) | $10-50 | Prices may vary depending on class of service and route, a good option for long-distance travel |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider using public transportation or ride-hailing services instead of taxis.\n- Use apps like Ola and Uber to book ride-hailing services, and always check the estimated fare before you start your journey.\n- When taking a taxi, always use the meter and negotiate the fare if you're not sure how much it will cost.\n- Be careful when driving in India, as traffic can be chaotic and roads may be poorly maintained.\n- Consider renting a car with a driver if you're not comfortable driving in Indian traffic.\n- Always wear a helmet when riding a two-wheeler, and follow traffic rules to stay safe on the road.",
