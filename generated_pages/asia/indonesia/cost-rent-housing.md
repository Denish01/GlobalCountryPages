[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Indonesia's housing market is characterized by a high demand for rental properties, particularly in urban areas such as Jakarta and Bali. The typical lease term for rental properties in Indonesia is one year, with a deposit requirement of one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are generally protected under Indonesian law, but it is essential for renters to carefully review their lease agreements and understand their obligations. Compared to its regional neighbors, Indonesia's housing costs are relatively moderate, with Malaysia and Singapore being more expensive, while Papua New Guinea and East Timor are generally less expensive.

The rental market in Indonesia is highly competitive, with a wide range of options available, from budget-friendly apartments to luxury villas. However, the quality and condition of rental properties can vary significantly, and renters should be prepared to negotiate prices and terms. Additionally, the cost of living in Indonesia can be relatively low, making it an attractive destination for expats and digital nomads. However, the country's housing market is also subject to fluctuations in the economy and currency exchange rates, which can impact rental prices and property values.
