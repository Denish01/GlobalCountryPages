Indonesia, the largest economy in the region, has a diverse economy with a strong manufacturing sector, while East Timor, a smaller and younger nation, relies heavily on oil and gas exports. The cost of living in Indonesia is generally lower than in East Timor, with prices for accommodation, food, and transportation being significantly cheaper. However, East Timor has a more relaxed and peaceful atmosphere, making it an attractive destination for those seeking a quieter lifestyle.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Indonesia has a large and growing middle class, which has driven up demand for goods and services, but also created a competitive market that keeps prices in check. In contrast, East Timor's economy is still developing, and the country relies heavily on imports, which can drive up prices. Overall, Indonesia is around 20-30% cheaper than East Timor, making it an attractive destination for expats, students, and retirees looking for an affordable lifestyle.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Indonesia (USD) | East Timor (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 200 | 350 | 42% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 150 | 250 | 40% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 400 | 600 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Indonesia (USD) | East Timor (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 3 | 5 | 40% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 50 | 80 | 37% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | 2 | 3 | 33% cheaper |\n| Coffee | 1 | 2 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Indonesia (USD) | East Timor (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 20 | 30 | 33% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | 0.5 | 1 | 50% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 0.7 | 1 | 30% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Indonesia (USD) | East Timor (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 50 | 80 | 37% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 20 | 30 | 33% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | 10 | 15 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Indonesia (USD) | East Timor (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 400 | 600 | 33% |\n| Mid-Range | 800 | 1,200 | 33% |\n| Comfortable | 1,200 | 1,800 | 33% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Indonesia is cheaper for:**\n  - Rent and housing, with prices up to 40% lower than in East Timor\n  - Food and dining, with meals and groceries up to 40% cheaper\n  - Transportation, with taxi fares and fuel prices up to 50% lower\n  - Utilities and internet, with prices up to 37% cheaper\n- **East Timor is cheaper for:**\n  - Certain imported goods, which may be cheaper due to the country's smaller market size\n  - Some tourist activities, such as diving and snorkeling, which may be more affordable in East Timor\n  - Local handicrafts and souvenirs, which may be cheaper in East Timor due to the country's smaller economy\n  - Certain types of accommodation, such as guesthouses and homestays, which may be more affordable in East Timor\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nIndonesia offers better value for expats, students, and retirees looking for an affordable lifestyle.
