  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Indonesia varies widely, with public healthcare services generally being more affordable but often overcrowded and understaffed, while private healthcare facilities offer higher-quality care at a significantly higher cost, with a health expenditure per capita of $132.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $132\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 31.1%\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 112\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: IDR\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nIndonesia has a mixed healthcare system, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. Public healthcare facilities, including hospitals and clinics, are generally more affordable but often struggle with overcrowding, understaffing, and limited resources. Private healthcare facilities, on the other hand, offer higher-quality care and more modern equipment, but at a significantly higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the primary option, while foreigners and expats tend to opt for private healthcare services. Having health insurance is highly recommended, especially for foreigners, as it can help cover the high costs of private healthcare.\n\nThe healthcare system in Indonesia is designed to provide universal coverage, with the government's **Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional (JKN)** program aiming to provide health insurance to all citizens. However, the quality of care and availability of services can vary significantly depending on the location and type of facility. In general, major cities like Jakarta and Bali tend to have better-equipped and staffed healthcare facilities, while rural areas often struggle with limited resources and accessibility. For foreigners, it's essential to research and understand the local healthcare system, including the availability of private healthcare facilities and the requirements for health insurance.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $5-$15 | $20-$50 | Prices vary by city and facility |\n| Specialist Consultation | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | Prices vary by specialty and location |\n| Dental Checkup | $5-$15 | $20-$50 | Prices vary by city and facility |\n| Eye Exam | $5-$15 | $20-$50 | Prices vary by city and facility |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $20-$50 | Prices vary by laboratory and location |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $20-$100 | Prices vary by hospital and location |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $50-$200 | Prices vary by hospital and location |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$2,000 | Prices vary by procedure and hospital |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $500-$2,000 | Prices vary by hospital and location |\n| MRI Scan | $100-$500 | Prices vary by hospital and location |\n| X-Ray | $20-$100 | Prices vary by hospital and location |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $10-$30 | Outpatient care, basic hospitalization, and emergency services |\n| Comprehensive Private | $50-$100 | Inpatient and outpatient care, specialist consultations, and advanced diagnostic tests |\n| International / Expat | $100-$200 | Worldwide coverage, including evacuation and repatriation services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Common medications like **antibiotics** and **pain relievers** can cost between $5-$10 per prescription\n- **Prescription medications** often require a doctor's prescription and can be more expensive, with prices ranging from $10-$50 per prescription\n- **Pharmacies** are widely available in major cities, but may be limited in rural areas\n- **Over-the-counter medications** are generally affordable and widely available\n- **Vaccinations** can cost between $10-$50 per dose, depending on the type and location\n- **Medication prices** can vary significantly depending on the location and pharmacy, with prices often being higher in tourist areas\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it's essential to call the local emergency number, 112, or seek immediate attention at the nearest hospital. **Ambulance services** are available in major cities, but may be limited in rural areas.
