Public schools are generally considered to be of lower quality than private schools, but are free or subsidized, making them more accessible to the general population. The language of instruction is Indonesian, but many private schools and international schools also offer instruction in English. Compulsory education in Indonesia lasts for 12 years, from age 6 to 18, and includes primary, junior secondary, and senior secondary education. International schools are available in major cities, offering a range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate, Cambridge International Examinations, and the American curriculum.\n\nThe quality of education in Indonesia can vary significantly depending on the institution and location. Public schools often struggle with limited resources and outdated teaching methods, while private schools and international schools tend to have more modern facilities and qualified teachers. Despite these challenges, Indonesia has made significant progress in improving its education system in recent years, with a growing focus on increasing access to quality education for all. The government has also implemented initiatives to improve teacher training, curriculum development, and educational infrastructure, which are expected to have a positive impact on the overall quality of education in the country.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 (free) | Limited resources and outdated teaching methods |\n| Private Primary | $500-$2,000 | Varies by tier and location, with higher-end schools offering more modern facilities and qualified teachers |\n| Public Secondary | $0 (free) | Limited resources and outdated teaching methods, but with more emphasis on vocational training |\n| Private Secondary | $1,000-$5,000 | Varies by tier and location, with higher-end schools offering more modern facilities and qualified teachers |\n| International School | $5,000-$15,000 | Offers a range of curricula, including IB, Cambridge, and American, with modern facilities and qualified teachers |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $500-$2,000 | $2,000-$5,000 | Limited availability for international students, with a focus on STEM fields |\n| Private University | $2,000-$5,000 | $5,000-$10,000 | Offers a range of programs, including business, engineering, and humanities, with modern facilities and qualified teachers |\n| Top-Ranked University | $3,000-$6,000 | $6,000-$12,000 | Includes universities such as the University of Indonesia and Gadjah Mada University, with a focus on research and academic excellence |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $50-$200 | Varies by location and quality of care, with higher-end schools offering more modern facilities and qualified teachers |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $10-$50 | Varies by subject and tutor qualification, with higher-end tutors offering more personalized instruction |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $100-$500 | Offers a range of languages, including English, Chinese, and Arabic, with modern facilities and qualified teachers |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $50-$200 | Includes textbooks, uniforms, and other materials, with higher-end schools offering more comprehensive packages |\n| School Uniform | $20-$100 | Varies by school and location, with higher-end schools offering more modern and stylish uniforms |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The best schools for expats in Indonesia are typically international schools, which offer a range of curricula and modern facilities, with qualified teachers and a focus on academic excellence.\n- Scholarship availability is limited, but some universities and organizations offer scholarships to local and international students, with a focus on merit-based and need-based awards.\n- Online learning options are becoming more popular in Indonesia, with many universities and institutions offering online courses and degree programs, with a focus on flexibility and accessibility.\n- Education quality in Indonesia is generally considered to be lower than in other countries in the region, but the government is working to improve the system, with a focus on increasing access to quality education for all.\n- Expats may find that the education system in Indonesia is quite different from what they are used to, with a focus on rote memorization and standardized testing, but with a growing emphasis on critical thinking and creativity.\n- It is recommended that expats research schools and universities thoroughly before making a decision, with a focus on factors such as curriculum, facilities, and teacher qualifications, to ensure that they find the best fit for their needs and budget.",
