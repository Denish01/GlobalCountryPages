[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Indonesia's healthcare system is structured around a mix of public and private providers, with the public sector providing the bulk of healthcare services, particularly in rural areas. The quality of care varies significantly between public and private facilities, with private hospitals and clinics generally offering higher standards of care. Urban areas, such as Jakarta and Bali, have better access to healthcare services, including specialized care and advanced medical equipment, whereas rural areas often struggle with limited resources and a shortage of skilled healthcare professionals. The government has implemented various initiatives to improve healthcare access and quality, including the **Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional** (JKN) health insurance program, which aims to provide universal health coverage to all citizens.

The public healthcare system in Indonesia is generally underfunded and understaffed, leading to long wait times and limited access to specialized care. In contrast, private hospitals and clinics offer high-quality care, often with English-speaking staff and modern facilities, but at a significantly higher cost. Expats and foreigners often opt for private healthcare services, which can be expensive, but provide better quality and more comprehensive care. The **Indonesian Ministry of Health** plays a crucial role in regulating and overseeing the healthcare system, including setting standards for healthcare providers and monitoring the quality of care.

Despite the challenges, Indonesia has made significant progress in improving healthcare outcomes, particularly in reducing infant and maternal mortality rates. However, the country still faces significant health challenges, including a high burden of infectious diseases, such as **tuberculosis** and **malaria**, as well as an increasing prevalence of non-communicable diseases, such as **diabetes** and **heart disease**. The government has implemented various initiatives to address these challenges, including health promotion programs and disease surveillance systems.
