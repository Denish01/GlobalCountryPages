[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Indonesia is an archipelago with a tropical climate, consisting of two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from May to September, is characterized by dry and sunny weather, making it the best time to visit Indonesia. The wet season, which runs from October to April, is marked by heavy rainfall and potential flooding, making it less ideal for travel. Indonesia's climate can be divided into three main zones: the equatorial zone, the tropical zone, and the subtropical zone. The equatorial zone, which includes the islands of Sumatra, Java, and Bali, experiences a relatively consistent temperature throughout the year, with average temperatures ranging from 20 to 30 degrees Celsius. The tropical zone, which includes the islands of Lombok, Sumbawa, and Flores, experiences a dry season from May to September and a wet season from October to April. The subtropical zone, which includes the islands of Papua and Maluku, experiences a dry season from May to October and a wet season from November to April.

The seasons in Indonesia can significantly affect travel plans, as the wet season can make roads impassable and tourist attractions closed. The dry season, on the other hand, is the peak tourist season, with many tourists flocking to popular destinations such as Bali and Lombok. The shoulder season, which runs from April to May and September to November, is a great time to visit Indonesia, as the weather is still pleasant and the crowds are smaller. The best time to visit Indonesia's beaches is during the dry season, when the sea is calm and the sun is shining. The best time to visit Indonesia's mountains is during the dry season, when the weather is cool and the trails are dry.

Indonesia's climate is also affected by the **El Niño** and **La Niña** phenomena, which can bring drought or heavy rainfall to the country. The **El Niño** phenomenon, which occurs when the sea surface temperature in the Pacific Ocean is higher than normal, can bring drought to Indonesia, while the **La Niña** phenomenon, which occurs when the sea surface temperature in the Pacific Ocean is lower than normal, can bring heavy rainfall. Understanding these phenomena can help travelers plan their trip to Indonesia and avoid any potential weather-related disruptions.
