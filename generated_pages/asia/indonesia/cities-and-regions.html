        <h2>How Indonesia Is Divided</h2>
        <p>Indonesia is an archipelago that spans over 17,000 islands, and its administrative structure reflects this vast geographical diversity. The country is divided into 34 provinces, each with its own capital and local government. These provinces are further divided into regencies and cities, which are the second-level administrative divisions. The provincial governments have a significant degree of autonomy, allowing them to manage their own affairs and make decisions on local matters.</p>
        <p>The administrative divisions in Indonesia are based on a combination of geographical, cultural, and historical factors. For example, the island of Java is divided into several provinces, including West Java, Central Java, and East Java, each with its own distinct cultural and historical identity. Similarly, the outer islands, such as Sumatra and Sulawesi, are also divided into provinces that reflect their unique cultural and geographical characteristics. This system of administration allows for a high degree of decentralization and flexibility, enabling local governments to respond to the specific needs and challenges of their regions.</p>
