However, the quality of the internet can vary greatly depending on the location. Urban areas such as Jakarta, Bali, and Surabaya tend to have faster and more reliable connections, while rural areas can experience slower speeds and more frequent outages. The Indonesian government has been working to improve the country's internet infrastructure, including the rollout of 5G networks in major cities. Despite these efforts, the internet in Indonesia can still be unreliable at times, and users may experience dropped connections or slow speeds, especially during peak hours.\n\nThe urban-rural divide in internet quality is a significant issue in Indonesia, with many rural areas lacking access to reliable and fast internet. This can make it difficult for people in these areas to access online services, communicate with others, and access information. However, the Indonesian government has been working to address this issue, including the launch of initiatives to improve internet access in rural areas. Additionally, many mobile providers offer affordable data plans and **prepaid SIM cards** that can be used to access the internet, making it more accessible to people in rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nGetting a SIM card in Indonesia is relatively easy, with many mobile providers offering **tourist SIM cards** that can be purchased at airports, shops, and markets. To buy a SIM card, you will need to provide a passport and fill out a registration form. The cost of a SIM card can vary depending on the provider and the data plan, but on average, a tourist SIM card can cost between 5-10 USD. Some of the main carriers in Indonesia include Telkomsel, Indosat, and XL Axiata, all of which offer a range of data plans and **prepaid options**. It's recommended to purchase a SIM card from a reputable provider, such as those mentioned above, to ensure that you get a reliable and fast connection.\n\n[TABLE]\n| Carrier | Tourist Plan | Data | Price (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Telkomsel | Tourist SIM | 10GB | 10 | Includes international calls and texts |\n| Indosat | Freedom Combo | 20GB | 15 | Includes streaming and social media access |\n| XL Axiata | HotRod | 30GB | 20 | Includes fast speeds and priority network access |\n| Smartfren | Tourist Plan | 5GB | 5 | Includes affordable data and calls |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] WiFi Availability [/SECTION]\n- Hotel WiFi quality is generally good, with many hotels offering fast and reliable connections\n- Cafe WiFi culture is widespread, with many cafes and coffee shops offering free WiFi to customers\n- Coworking spaces are becoming increasingly popular, with many offering fast and reliable WiFi connections\n- Public WiFi is available in many areas, including airports, shopping malls, and public parks\n- Many restaurants and bars also offer free WiFi to customers, making it easy to stay connected while eating or socializing\n\n[SECTION] For Remote Workers [/SECTION]\n- Coworking spaces such as **WeWork** and **CoHive** offer fast and reliable WiFi connections, as well as other amenities such as meeting rooms and printers\n- Reliable cafe chains such as **Starbucks** and **The Coffee Bean** offer free WiFi and a comfortable working environment\n- Backup internet options such as **portable WiFi hotspots** and **mobile tethering** can be useful in case of an emergency or outage\n- VPNs are recommended to ensure secure and private internet access, especially when working with sensitive data\n- Many **coliving spaces** also offer fast and reliable WiFi connections, as well as other amenities such as shared kitchens and social areas\n\n[SECTION] Tips & Warnings [/SECTION]\n- Internet censorship is a significant issue in Indonesia, with many websites and services blocked or restricted\n- Blocked sites include those that are deemed to be **pornographic**, **violent**, or **subversive**, as well as some social media and messaging apps\n- VPNs are recommended to bypass internet censorship and ensure secure and private internet access\n- Roaming alternatives such as **eSIMs** and **portable WiFi hotspots** can be useful for travelers who need to stay connected while on the move\n- It's also recommended to use **secure passwords** and **two-factor authentication** to protect your online accounts and data\n- Be aware of **public WiFi security risks**, such as hacking and data theft, and take steps to protect yourself, such as using a VPN and keeping your device and software up to date",
