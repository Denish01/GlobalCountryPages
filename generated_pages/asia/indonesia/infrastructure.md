[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Indonesia's infrastructure development level is moderate, with significant improvements in recent years, particularly in the transportation and energy sectors. The government has invested heavily in infrastructure development, with a focus on increasing connectivity and accessibility across the country. However, there is still a significant gap between urban and rural areas, with many rural communities lacking access to basic infrastructure such as roads, electricity, and clean water. Recent investments have focused on improving the country's transportation network, including the development of new airports, seaports, and highways.

The Indonesian government has also implemented various initiatives to improve the country's infrastructure, including the establishment of a national infrastructure development plan and the creation of a dedicated infrastructure development agency. These efforts have helped to attract foreign investment and improve the overall quality of the country's infrastructure. Despite these improvements, Indonesia still faces significant challenges in terms of infrastructure development, including a lack of funding, corruption, and bureaucratic inefficiencies.

The urban-rural gap in infrastructure development is a significant challenge facing Indonesia, with many rural communities lacking access to basic infrastructure such as roads, electricity, and clean water. The government has implemented various initiatives to address this issue, including the development of rural infrastructure programs and the establishment of special economic zones in rural areas. However, more needs to be done to address this issue and ensure that all communities have access to the infrastructure they need to thrive.
