  "content": "Indonesia is home to a diverse population of over 277 million people, making it the fourth most populous country in the world, with a population breakdown that reflects its rich cultural heritage and geographic complexity.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nTotal Population: 277.0 million\nPopulation Growth Rate: 0.9%\nMedian Age: 30.5 years\nUrban Population: 56.6%\nPopulation Density: 145 per km2\nLife Expectancy: 71.7 years\nFertility Rate: 2.1 children per woman\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]\nIndonesia's large population is a significant factor in its economic and social development, with the country experiencing steady growth in recent years. The population growth rate is approximately 0.9% per annum, which is relatively low compared to other developing countries. Indonesia's population is also becoming increasingly urbanized, with over 56% of the population living in urban areas. This trend is driven by economic opportunities and improved access to education and healthcare in cities. However, it also poses challenges such as housing shortages, traffic congestion, and strain on public services. The country's population is also characterized by a relatively young age structure, with a median age of 30.5 years, which presents opportunities for economic growth and development.\n\nThe population of Indonesia is spread across more than 17,000 islands, with the majority living on the islands of Java, Sumatra, Bali, and Kalimantan. The country's population is also diverse in terms of ethnicity, language, and religion, with over 300 ethnic groups and more than 700 languages spoken. This diversity is reflected in the country's cultural practices, traditions, and customs. Indonesia's population is also subject to various migration patterns, both within the country and internationally. Many Indonesians migrate to other countries in search of work, education, or better living standards, while others move within the country to urban areas or other regions in search of economic opportunities.\n\nThe population of Indonesia is expected to continue growing in the coming years, although at a slower rate than in the past. The country's population is projected to reach over 300 million by 2030, which will pose significant challenges for the government and other stakeholders in terms of providing basic services such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure. To address these challenges, the government has implemented various policies and programs aimed at promoting sustainable development, reducing poverty, and improving access to education and healthcare.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Javanese | 40.2% | Java | Largest ethnic group in Indonesia |\n| Sundanese | 15.4% | Java | Second largest ethnic group in Indonesia |\n| Malay | 3.4% | Sumatra | Predominantly found in eastern Sumatra |\n| Madurese | 3.3% | Madura | Found in Madura Island and surrounding areas |\n| Minangkabau | 2.7% | Sumatra | Known for their matrilineal society and cultural practices |\n| Buginese | 2.5% | Sulawesi | Predominantly found in southern Sulawesi |\n| Batak | 1.7% | Sumatra | Known for their distinct culture and traditions |\n[/TABLE]\nIndonesia is home to over 300 ethnic groups, each with their own distinct culture, language, and traditions.
