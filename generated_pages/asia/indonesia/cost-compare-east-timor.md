[SECTION] Overview: Indonesia vs East Timor [/SECTION]
Indonesia and East Timor are two neighboring countries in Southeast Asia with distinct economic profiles. Indonesia, the largest economy in the region, has a diverse economy with a strong manufacturing sector, while East Timor, a smaller and younger nation, relies heavily on oil and gas exports.

However, East Timor has a more relaxed and peaceful atmosphere, making it an attractive destination for those seeking a quieter lifestyle.

The economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining the cost of living. Indonesia has a large and growing middle class, which has driven up demand for goods and services, but also created a competitive market that keeps prices in check.
