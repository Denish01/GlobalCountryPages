[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Indonesia has a mixed healthcare system, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. Public healthcare facilities, including hospitals and clinics, are generally more affordable but often struggle with overcrowding, understaffing, and limited resources. Private healthcare facilities, on the other hand, offer higher-quality care and more modern equipment, but at a significantly higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the primary option, while foreigners and expats tend to opt for private healthcare services. Having health insurance is highly recommended, especially for foreigners, as it can help cover the high costs of private healthcare.

The healthcare system in Indonesia is designed to provide universal coverage, with the government's **Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional (JKN)** program aiming to provide health insurance to all citizens. However, the quality of care and availability of services can vary significantly depending on the location and type of facility. In general, major cities like Jakarta and Bali tend to have better-equipped and staffed healthcare facilities, while rural areas often struggle with limited resources and accessibility. For foreigners, it's essential to research and understand the local healthcare system, including the availability of private healthcare facilities and the requirements for health insurance.
