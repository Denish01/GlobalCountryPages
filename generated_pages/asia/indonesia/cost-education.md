[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Indonesia is divided into public and private institutions, with varying levels of quality. Public schools are generally considered to be of lower quality than private schools, but are free or subsidized, making them more accessible to the general population. The language of instruction is Indonesian, but many private schools and international schools also offer instruction in English. Compulsory education in Indonesia lasts for 12 years, from age 6 to 18, and includes primary, junior secondary, and senior secondary education. International schools are available in major cities, offering a range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate, Cambridge International Examinations, and the American curriculum.

The quality of education in Indonesia can vary significantly depending on the institution and location. Public schools often struggle with limited resources and outdated teaching methods, while private schools and international schools tend to have more modern facilities and qualified teachers. Despite these challenges, Indonesia has made significant progress in improving its education system in recent years, with a growing focus on increasing access to quality education for all. The government has also implemented initiatives to improve teacher training, curriculum development, and educational infrastructure, which are expected to have a positive impact on the overall quality of education in the country.
