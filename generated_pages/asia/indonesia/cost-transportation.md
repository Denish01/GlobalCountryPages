[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Indonesia has a diverse range of transportation modes, from traditional **becak** (cycle rickshaws) to modern **MRT** (mass rapid transit) systems. The quality of public transit varies greatly between cities, with major cities like Jakarta and Surabaya having more comprehensive systems. Most people in Indonesia get around using **motorcycles** or **cars**, due to the lack of efficient public transportation in many areas. However, in recent years, the government has been investing in improving the public transportation infrastructure, including the development of **bus rapid transit (BRT)** systems and **commuter trains**.

In addition to the government's efforts, **ride-hailing apps** such as Grab and Go-Van have become increasingly popular, providing a convenient and affordable way for people to get around. These apps have not only changed the way people travel but also created new job opportunities for drivers. Despite these advancements, traffic congestion remains a significant issue in many Indonesian cities, making it essential for visitors to plan their transportation in advance and consider the time of day when traveling.
