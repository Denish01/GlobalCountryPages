[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in Indonesia has improved significantly over the past few years, with the average internet speed increasing to 10.6 Mbps download. However, the quality of the internet can vary greatly depending on the location. Urban areas such as Jakarta, Bali, and Surabaya tend to have faster and more reliable connections, while rural areas can experience slower speeds and more frequent outages. The Indonesian government has been working to improve the country's internet infrastructure, including the rollout of 5G networks in major cities. Despite these efforts, the internet in Indonesia can still be unreliable at times, and users may experience dropped connections or slow speeds, especially during peak hours.

The urban-rural divide in internet quality is a significant issue in Indonesia, with many rural areas lacking access to reliable and fast internet. This can make it difficult for people in these areas to access online services, communicate with others, and access information. However, the Indonesian government has been working to address this issue, including the launch of initiatives to improve internet access in rural areas. Additionally, many mobile providers offer affordable data plans and **prepaid SIM cards** that can be used to access the internet, making it more accessible to people in rural areas.

Getting a SIM card in Indonesia is relatively easy, with many mobile providers offering **tourist SIM cards** that can be purchased at airports, shops, and markets. To buy a SIM card, you will need to provide a passport and fill out a registration form. The cost of a SIM card can vary depending on the provider and the data plan, but on average, a tourist SIM card can cost between 5-10 USD. Some of the main carriers in Indonesia include Telkomsel, Indosat, and XL Axiata, all of which offer a range of data plans and **prepaid options**. It's recommended to purchase a SIM card from a reputable provider, such as those mentioned above, to ensure that you get a reliable and fast connection.
