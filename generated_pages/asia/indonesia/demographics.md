[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Indonesia's large population is a significant factor in its economic and social development, with the country experiencing steady growth in recent years. The population growth rate is approximately 0.9% per annum, which is relatively low compared to other developing countries. Indonesia's population is also becoming increasingly urbanized, with over 56% of the population living in urban areas. This trend is driven by economic opportunities and improved access to education and healthcare in cities. However, it also poses challenges such as housing shortages, traffic congestion, and strain on public services. The country's population is also characterized by a relatively young age structure, with a median age of 30.5 years, which presents opportunities for economic growth and development.

The population of Indonesia is spread across more than 17,000 islands, with the majority living on the islands of Java, Sumatra, Bali, and Kalimantan. The country's population is also diverse in terms of ethnicity, language, and religion, with over 300 ethnic groups and more than 700 languages spoken. This diversity is reflected in the country's cultural practices, traditions, and customs. Indonesia's population is also subject to various migration patterns, both within the country and internationally. Many Indonesians migrate to other countries in search of work, education, or better living standards, while others move within the country to urban areas or other regions in search of economic opportunities.

The population of Indonesia is expected to continue growing in the coming years, although at a slower rate than in the past. The country's population is projected to reach over 300 million by 2030, which will pose significant challenges for the government and other stakeholders in terms of providing basic services such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure. To address these challenges, the government has implemented various policies and programs aimed at promoting sustainable development, reducing poverty, and improving access to education and healthcare.
