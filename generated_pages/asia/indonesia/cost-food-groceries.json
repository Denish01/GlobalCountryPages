Compared to its neighboring countries, Indonesia's food prices are relatively affordable, with a meal at a local eatery or street food stall costing around $1-2 USD. The cost of food in Indonesia is driven by factors such as transportation costs, seasonal availability of ingredients, and government subsidies for certain staples like rice. The country has a strong eating-out culture, with many locals preferring to dine at street food stalls, warungs, or restaurants rather than cooking at home. However, with the rise of modern supermarkets and online grocery shopping, home cooking is becoming more popular, especially among the middle class.\n\nThe inflation rate in Indonesia is relatively low, at 2.2% in 2024, which has helped to keep food prices stable. However, the country's large population and growing middle class have led to an increase in demand for higher-end foods and dining experiences, which can drive up prices. Overall, Indonesia offers a wide range of affordable and delicious food options, making it a great destination for foodies and travelers on a budget. The country's **GDP per capita PPP** of $16,448 in 2024 has also contributed to an increase in disposable income, allowing more people to dine out and enjoy a variety of cuisines.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $1.50 | 22,000 IDR | |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $1.20 | 18,000 IDR | |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $1.80 | 26,000 IDR | |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $0.60 | 9,000 IDR | subsidized by the government |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $3.50 | 50,000 IDR | |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $6.00 | 90,000 IDR | |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $4.00 | 60,000 IDR | imported from China or the US |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $1.20 | 18,000 IDR | |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $0.80 | 12,000 IDR | |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $0.60 | 9,000 IDR | |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $5.00 | 75,000 IDR | |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $0.60 | 9,000 IDR | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $1-3 | nasi goreng, gado-gado, satay |\n| Casual Restaurant | $5-10 | one person, Indonesian or Chinese cuisine |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $15-30 | 3 courses, Western or Asian fusion |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $50-100 | upscale, haute cuisine |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $2-4 | Bintang or Anker |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $5-7 | Heineken or Carlsberg |\n| Cappuccino | $2-4 | coffee shop or cafe |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $1-2 | Coca-Cola or Pepsi |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nWhen it comes to grocery shopping in Indonesia, there are two main options: supermarkets and local markets. Supermarkets like Carrefour, Giant, and Hypermart offer a wide range of products, including imported goods, at fixed prices. However, prices at supermarkets tend to be higher than at local markets, where fresh produce, meat, and spices are often sold at lower prices. Local markets, also known as **pasar**, are a great place to buy fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as traditional Indonesian ingredients like **tempeh** and **kecap manis**. However, be prepared to haggle and bargain, as prices are often negotiable.\n\nThe price difference between supermarkets and local markets can be significant, with some items costing up to 50% more at supermarkets. For example, a kilogram of **rice** can cost around $0.60 USD at a local market, while the same item can cost around $1.20 USD at a supermarket. However, supermarkets often offer more convenience and a wider range of products, making them a popular choice for many Indonesians. When shopping at local markets, it's a good idea to learn some basic Indonesian phrases, such as **\"berapa harga?\"** (how much is the price?) and **\"bisa kurang?\"** (can you lower the price?).\n\n[SECTION] Local Food Tips [/SECTION]\n- Eat at local eateries or street food stalls to try authentic Indonesian cuisine at affordable prices\n- Try **nasi goreng** or **gado-gado** for a filling and delicious meal\n- Buy fresh fruits and vegetables at local markets for the best prices and quality\n- Learn to cook Indonesian dishes like **sate** or **martabak** to save money and enjoy local flavors\n- Avoid buying imported goods, especially food and beverages, as they tend to be more expensive\n- Visit **warungs** or **kedai** for a unique and affordable dining experience, with a variety of local dishes and drinks on offer",
