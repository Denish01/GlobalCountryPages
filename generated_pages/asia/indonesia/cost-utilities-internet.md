[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Indonesia's utility infrastructure quality has improved significantly over the years, with the government investing heavily in the development of the country's electricity, water, and gas sectors. However, costs can still fluctuate due to seasonal variation, with higher bills during the dry season when water and electricity usage tend to increase. The Indonesian government has implemented various measures to stabilize utility costs, including subsidies for low-income households and price controls on essential commodities.

The cost of utilities in Indonesia can vary depending on the region, with urban areas like Jakarta and Bali tend to have higher bills compared to rural areas. Additionally, the country's reliance on fossil fuels for electricity generation means that utility costs can be affected by global oil price fluctuations. Despite these challenges, Indonesia's utility sector has made significant progress in recent years, with the government aiming to increase the share of renewable energy in the country's energy mix to 23% by 2025.
