[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Indonesia has a **territorial taxation** system, where residents are taxed on their worldwide income, while non-residents are taxed only on their Indonesian-sourced income. To be considered a tax resident in Indonesia, an individual must have a permanent home in the country, or have been present in the country for more than 183 days in a 12-month period. The tax system is overseen by the **Directorate General of Taxes (DGT)**, which is responsible for collecting taxes, enforcing tax laws, and providing taxpayer services.

The Indonesian tax system is designed to promote economic growth and development, while also ensuring that individuals and businesses comply with their tax obligations. The government offers various incentives and exemptions to encourage investment and entrepreneurship, particularly in certain industries such as manufacturing and tourism. However, the tax system can be complex, and taxpayers are required to comply with various regulations and filing requirements to avoid penalties and fines.
