The quality of public transit varies greatly between cities, with major cities like Jakarta and Surabaya having more comprehensive systems. Most people in Indonesia get around using **motorcycles** or **cars**, due to the lack of efficient public transportation in many areas. However, in recent years, the government has been investing in improving the public transportation infrastructure, including the development of **bus rapid transit (BRT)** systems and **commuter trains**.\n\nIn addition to the government's efforts, **ride-hailing apps** such as Grab and Go-Van have become increasingly popular, providing a convenient and affordable way for people to get around. These apps have not only changed the way people travel but also created new job opportunities for drivers. Despite these advancements, traffic congestion remains a significant issue in many Indonesian cities, making it essential for visitors to plan their transportation in advance and consider the time of day when traveling.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.25-$0.50 | $10-$20 | Limited coverage in smaller cities |\n| Metro / Subway | $0.25-$0.50 | $20-$30 | Available in Jakarta and a few other major cities |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $0.50-$1.00 | N/A | Extensive network, but can be crowded |\n| Commuter Train | $0.25-$1.00 | $10-$30 | Available in Jakarta and surrounding areas |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $1.50 | $0.50 | $3-$5 | Be sure to use a reputable company |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $1.00 | $0.25 | $2-$4 | Grab and Go-Van are popular options |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $10-$20 | Depending on the airport and destination |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $0.70 | Prices may vary depending on location |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $0.60 | Used for larger vehicles and trucks |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $20-$50 | Economy car, prices vary depending on location and company |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-$3 | Prices may vary depending on location and time of day |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $2-$5 | Used for long-distance travel, prices vary depending on route |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $5-$15 | Depending on the route and company |\n| Domestic Flight | $20-$100 | Typical route, prices vary depending on airline and time of booking |\n| Train (long-distance) | $10-$50 | Available for certain routes, prices vary depending on class and route |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Consider purchasing a **local SIM card** to access ride-hailing apps and navigate using GPS.\n- Always **negotiate the fare** before getting into a taxi or ride-hailing vehicle.\n- Be aware of **traffic congestion** and plan your route accordingly, especially during peak hours.\n- Use **reputable taxi companies** to avoid scams and ensure a safe ride.\n- Consider **renting a car** for long-distance travel, but be aware of the **toll roads** and **parking fees**.\n- Always **wear a helmet** when riding a motorcycle, and follow local traffic laws to ensure your safety.",
