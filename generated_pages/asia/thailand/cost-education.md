[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
Thailand's education system is divided into public and private sectors, with the public sector being the largest. Public schools in Thailand are generally considered to provide a good quality education, with a strong emphasis on **Thai language and culture**. However, the quality of education can vary significantly depending on the location and resources available. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a more Western-style education and are often preferred by expats and wealthy Thais. Compulsory education in Thailand lasts for 12 years, from primary school to upper secondary school. International schools are also available in major cities like Bangkok and Chiang Mai, offering a range of curricula including **International Baccalaureate** and **British A-levels**.

The language of instruction in Thai public schools is **Thai**, while private and international schools often use **English** as the primary language of instruction. This can make it difficult for foreign students who do not speak Thai to integrate into the public school system. However, many private and international schools offer **English language support** and other services to help students adjust to the Thai education system. Overall, Thailand's education system offers a range of options for students, from affordable public schools to high-end international schools.
