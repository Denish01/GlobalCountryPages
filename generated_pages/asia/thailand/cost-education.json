Public schools in Thailand are generally considered to provide a good quality education, with a strong emphasis on **Thai language and culture**. However, the quality of education can vary significantly depending on the location and resources available. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a more Western-style education and are often preferred by expats and wealthy Thais. Compulsory education in Thailand lasts for 12 years, from primary school to upper secondary school. International schools are also available in major cities like Bangkok and Chiang Mai, offering a range of curricula including **International Baccalaureate** and **British A-levels**.\n\nThe language of instruction in Thai public schools is **Thai**, while private and international schools often use **English** as the primary language of instruction. This can make it difficult for foreign students who do not speak Thai to integrate into the public school system. However, many private and international schools offer **English language support** and other services to help students adjust to the Thai education system. Overall, Thailand's education system offers a range of options for students, from affordable public schools to high-end international schools.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0-$100 | Free or subsidized, with some costs for uniforms and supplies |\n| Private Primary | $1,000-$5,000 | Range depends on the tier and location of the school |\n| Public Secondary | $0-$200 | Free or subsidized, with some costs for uniforms and supplies |\n| Private Secondary | $2,000-$10,000 | Range depends on the tier and location of the school |\n| International School | $5,000-$20,000 | Curriculum types include IB, British A-levels, and US-style education |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $1,000-$3,000 | $2,000-$5,000 | Tuition fees vary depending on the university and program |\n| Private University | $2,000-$6,000 | $3,000-$10,000 | Tuition fees vary depending on the university and program |\n| Top-Ranked University | $3,000-$8,000 | $5,000-$15,000 | Examples include Mahidol University and Chulalongkorn University |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $100-$500 | Costs vary depending on the location and quality of the preschool |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $20-$50 | Costs vary depending on the subject and experience of the tutor |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $100-$300 | Costs vary depending on the language and level of instruction |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $50-$200 | Costs vary depending on the school and grade level |\n| School Uniform | $20-$100 | Costs vary depending on the school and quality of the uniform |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The **best schools for expats** in Thailand are often international schools, which offer a range of curricula and languages of instruction.\n- **Scholarship availability** is limited in Thailand, but some universities and organizations offer scholarships to international students.\n- **Online learning options** are becoming more popular in Thailand, with many universities and institutions offering online courses and degree programs.\n- Education quality in Thailand is generally considered to be **good compared to the region**, with many universities and institutions offering high-quality programs and research opportunities.\n- **Language support** is often available for international students, but it's still important to have a good understanding of the **Thai language and culture** to get the most out of the education system.\n- **Accreditation** is an important factor to consider when choosing a university or institution in Thailand, as it can affect the recognition and transferability of degrees.",
