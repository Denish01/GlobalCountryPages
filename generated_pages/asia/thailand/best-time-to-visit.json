The country can be divided into three climate zones: the north, northeast, and south. The northern region has a cooler climate than the rest of the country, while the southern region has a more tropical climate. The dry season, which runs from November to April, is the best time to visit Thailand, with minimal rainfall and comfortable temperatures. The wet season, which runs from May to October, is characterized by heavy rainfall and flash flooding, making it less ideal for travel.\n\nThe seasons in Thailand have a significant impact on travel, with the dry season being the peak tourist season. During this time, popular destinations such as Bangkok, Chiang Mai, and Phuket are crowded with tourists, and prices for accommodations and tourist services are at their highest. The wet season, on the other hand, is the low season, with fewer tourists and lower prices. However, some tourist attractions and roads may be closed due to flooding, and outdoor activities such as trekking and diving may be limited.\n\nThe cool season, which runs from November to February, is the best time to visit Thailand, with comfortable temperatures and minimal rainfall. This is also the peak season for festivals and events, with many major festivals taking place during this time.
