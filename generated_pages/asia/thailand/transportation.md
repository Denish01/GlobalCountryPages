[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Thailand has several major international airports, with Suvarnabhumi Airport (BKK) and Don Mueang International Airport (DMK) being the two main hubs in Bangkok. These airports receive direct flights from major cities around the world, including London, Tokyo, and Sydney. You can also enter Thailand by land through border crossings with neighboring countries such as Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, and Malaysia. The most common overland entry points are at the border towns of Aranyaprathet (for Cambodia), Mae Sai (for Myanmar), and Nong Khai (for Laos).

In addition to flying, you can also take buses or trains from neighboring countries to get to Thailand. For example, you can take a bus from Vientiane in Laos to Bangkok, or a train from Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia to the southern Thai city of Hat Yai. However, these options can be slower and less convenient than flying, and may require more planning and research. It's also worth noting that some border crossings may have limited hours of operation or require special permits, so it's a good idea to research the specific requirements for your route before you go.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Thailand has an extensive domestic air network, with several airlines operating flights between major cities and tourist destinations. The main domestic airlines are Thai Airways, Bangkok Airways, and low-cost carriers such as Air Asia and Nok Air. You can fly from Bangkok to popular tourist destinations like Chiang Mai, Phuket, and Koh Samui, as well as to smaller cities and towns throughout the country. Booking domestic flights in advance is recommended, especially during peak travel seasons, as prices can be higher and availability may be limited. Approximate costs for domestic flights range from $20 to $100, depending on the route and airline.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Thailand's rail network is moderate, with trains connecting major cities and tourist destinations. The **State Railway of Thailand** operates trains on several routes, including the Northern Line from Bangkok to Chiang Mai, the Northeastern Line from Bangkok to Nong Khai, and the Southern Line from Bangkok to Surat Thani. You can book train tickets in advance at train stations or online through the State Railway of Thailand website. High-speed trains are not yet available in Thailand, but there are plans to develop a high-speed rail network in the future. Train travel can be a convenient and scenic way to see the countryside, but it can also be slower than flying or taking buses.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Thailand has a well-developed bus network, with several companies operating intercity buses and coaches. The main bus companies are **The Transport Company** and **Green Bus**, which operate on routes throughout the country. You can take buses from Bangkok to major cities and tourist destinations, as well as to smaller towns and villages. Bus travel can be a affordable and convenient way to get around, with approximate costs ranging from $5 to $20, depending on the route and class of service.
