[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Thailand is situated in the heart of Southeast Asia, with a strategic location that connects the Indian Ocean to the Pacific Ocean through the Strait of Malacca. The country shares borders with four neighboring countries: Myanmar to the west, Laos to the northeast, Cambodia to the southeast, and Malaysia to the south. Thailand is also surrounded by several major bodies of water, including the Gulf of Thailand to the east, the Andaman Sea to the west, and the Indian Ocean to the southwest.

Thailand's location has played a significant role in shaping its history, culture, and economy. The country's proximity to the equator and its coastal location have made it an important hub for trade and commerce, with many major ports and shipping lanes passing through its waters. Thailand's borders have also been influenced by its complex geography, with mountains, rivers, and forests creating natural barriers and divisions between different regions.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Thailand's terrain is characterized by a mix of mountains, valleys, and coastal plains. The northern region is dominated by the **Thanon Thong Chai Range**, a mountain range that stretches from Myanmar to Laos, with peaks reaching elevations of over 2,000 meters. The central region is a fertile valley, known as the **Chao Phraya Delta**, which is home to the country's largest river, the Chao Phraya, and is the most densely populated area of Thailand. The southern region is a narrow peninsula, known as the **Isthmus of Kra**, which connects the mainland to the island of **Phuket** and other smaller islands.

Thailand's landscape is also home to many forests, including tropical rainforests, mangrove forests, and coral reefs. The country has a long coastline, with many beautiful beaches, bays, and islands, including the popular tourist destinations of **Phuket**, **Koh Samui**, and **Krabi**. The interior of the country is also home to many national parks and wildlife sanctuaries, which provide a habitat for a wide range of flora and fauna, including elephants, tigers, and monkeys.

Thailand's geography has also been shaped by its many rivers, which have played a crucial role in the country's history and development. The **Chao Phraya River**, which flows through the capital city of Bangkok, is the country's longest and most important river, and has been the lifeblood of Thai civilization for centuries. Other major rivers in Thailand include the **Mekong River**, which forms the border with Laos, and the **Salween River**, which forms the border with Myanmar.
