However, there is still a notable gap between urban and rural areas, with cities like Bangkok and Chiang Mai having more developed infrastructure than rural provinces. The government has been actively working to address this gap, with initiatives such as the **Eastern Economic Corridor** (EEC) project, which aims to develop the eastern region of the country into a major economic hub.\n\nThailand's infrastructure has seen significant improvements in recent years, with investments in new roads, railways, and airports. The country has also made significant progress in increasing access to electricity and internet, with over 99% of the population having access to electricity and over 81% having access to the internet. However, there are still challenges to be addressed, particularly in rural areas where access to basic infrastructure such as roads, water, and sanitation can be limited.\n\nThe Thai government has been actively working to promote economic growth and development through infrastructure investments, with a focus on improving the country's transportation networks and increasing access to basic services such as electricity and water. The government has also been working to promote private sector investment in infrastructure, with initiatives such as public-private partnerships (PPPs) and concessions.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 212,000 km | Good | 75% paved, with major highways connecting major cities |\n| Railways | 4,800 km | Moderate | Mostly single-track, with some double-track sections |\n| Airports | 38 international and domestic | Good | Major airports in Bangkok, Chiang Mai, and Phuket |\n| Ports | 6 major | Good | Major ports in Bangkok, Laem Chabang, and Songkhla |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- Thailand's power generation is mostly based on **natural gas**, which accounts for over 60% of the country's electricity generation\n- The country has also been increasing its use of **renewable energy**, with a target of 30% of total power generation by 2030\n- Electricity reliability is generally good, with an average of less than 1 hour of power outages per year\n- The government has been working to promote energy efficiency and reduce energy consumption, with initiatives such as smart grids and energy-efficient appliances\n- Thailand has also been investing in **energy storage** technologies, such as batteries, to improve the stability of the grid and reduce reliance on fossil fuels\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- Tap water safety is generally good in urban areas, but can be a concern in rural areas where access to clean water is limited\n- Sanitation coverage is relatively high, with over 90% of the population having access to improved sanitation facilities\n- Water access in rural areas is a significant challenge, with many communities relying on **groundwater** or **rainwater harvesting** for their water needs\n- The government has been working to improve access to clean water and sanitation, with initiatives such as the **Water Supply Development Project** and the **Sanitation and Hygiene Project**\n- Thailand has also been investing in **wastewater treatment** technologies, with a target of treating at least 80% of the country's wastewater by 2030\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- Mobile coverage is relatively high, with over 95% of the population having access to mobile networks\n- Fiber/broadband penetration is increasing, with over 50% of households having access to fiber-optic internet\n- The country has been rolling out **4G** and **5G** networks, with a target of covering at least 90% of the population by 2025\n- Postal services are relatively well-developed, with a network of post offices and mail delivery services covering most of the country\n- Thailand has also been investing in **digital infrastructure**, such as data centers and cloud computing services, to support the growth of the digital economy\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The **Eastern Economic Corridor** (EEC) project is a major infrastructure development project aimed at promoting economic growth and development in the eastern region of the country\n- The **High-Speed Rail** project is a planned railway line connecting Bangkok to Chiang Mai, with a target completion date of 2027\n- The **Laem Chabang Port** expansion project is a major infrastructure development project aimed at increasing the capacity of the port and improving its efficiency\n- The **Smart Grid** project is a planned initiative to improve the efficiency and reliability of the country's energy grid, with a target completion date of 2025\n- The **Water Supply Development Project** is a planned initiative to improve access to clean water and sanitation in rural areas, with a target completion date of 2028",
