# Thailand Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

Thailand's infrastructure is a mix of modern and developing systems, with significant investments in recent years to improve the country's transportation networks, energy generation, and telecommunications.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 99.6% of population
Internet Penetration: 81.1%
Road Network: 212,000 km, with 75% paved
Rail Network: 4,800 km
Major Airports: 38
Major Ports: 6
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Thailand's infrastructure development level is relatively high compared to other countries in Southeast Asia, with significant investments in recent years to improve the country's transportation networks, energy generation, and telecommunications. However, there is still a notable gap between urban and rural areas, with cities like Bangkok and Chiang Mai having more developed infrastructure than rural provinces. The government has been actively working to address this gap, with initiatives such as the **Eastern Economic Corridor** (EEC) project, which aims to develop the eastern region of the country into a major economic hub.

Thailand's infrastructure has seen significant improvements in recent years, with investments in new roads, railways, and airports. The country has also made significant progress in increasing access to electricity and internet, with over 99% of the population having access to electricity and over 81% having access to the internet. However, there are still challenges to be addressed, particularly in rural areas where access to basic infrastructure such as roads, water, and sanitation can be limited.

The Thai government has been actively working to promote economic growth and development through infrastructure investments, with a focus on improving the country's transportation networks and increasing access to basic services such as electricity and water. The government has also been working to promote private sector investment in infrastructure, with initiatives such as public-private partnerships (PPPs) and concessions.
