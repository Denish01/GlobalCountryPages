  "content": "To get around in Thailand, you can use a variety of transportation options, including domestic flights, trains, buses, taxis, and ride-hailing apps, as well as drive yourself with a rental car or motorbike.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMain International Airport(s): Suvarnabhumi Airport (BKK), Don Mueang International Airport (DMK)\nDomestic Air Network: extensive\nRail Network: moderate\nDrives On: left\nRoad Quality: moderate\nRide-Hailing Apps: Grab, local alternatives\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]\nThailand has several major international airports, with Suvarnabhumi Airport (BKK) and Don Mueang International Airport (DMK) being the two main hubs in Bangkok. These airports receive direct flights from major cities around the world, including London, Tokyo, and Sydney. You can also enter Thailand by land through border crossings with neighboring countries such as Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, and Malaysia. The most common overland entry points are at the border towns of Aranyaprathet (for Cambodia), Mae Sai (for Myanmar), and Nong Khai (for Laos).\n\nIn addition to flying, you can also take buses or trains from neighboring countries to get to Thailand. For example, you can take a bus from Vientiane in Laos to Bangkok, or a train from Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia to the southern Thai city of Hat Yai. However, these options can be slower and less convenient than flying, and may require more planning and research. It's also worth noting that some border crossings may have limited hours of operation or require special permits, so it's a good idea to research the specific requirements for your route before you go.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nThailand has an extensive domestic air network, with several airlines operating flights between major cities and tourist destinations. The main domestic airlines are Thai Airways, Bangkok Airways, and low-cost carriers such as Air Asia and Nok Air. You can fly from Bangkok to popular tourist destinations like Chiang Mai, Phuket, and Koh Samui, as well as to smaller cities and towns throughout the country. Booking domestic flights in advance is recommended, especially during peak travel seasons, as prices can be higher and availability may be limited. Approximate costs for domestic flights range from $20 to $100, depending on the route and airline.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nThailand's rail network is moderate, with trains connecting major cities and tourist destinations. The **State Railway of Thailand** operates trains on several routes, including the Northern Line from Bangkok to Chiang Mai, the Northeastern Line from Bangkok to Nong Khai, and the Southern Line from Bangkok to Surat Thani. You can book train tickets in advance at train stations or online through the State Railway of Thailand website. High-speed trains are not yet available in Thailand, but there are plans to develop a high-speed rail network in the future. Train travel can be a convenient and scenic way to see the countryside, but it can also be slower than flying or taking buses.\n\n[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]\nThailand has a well-developed bus network, with several companies operating intercity buses and coaches. The main bus companies are **The Transport Company** and **Green Bus**, which operate on routes throughout the country. You can take buses from Bangkok to major cities and tourist destinations, as well as to smaller towns and villages. Bus travel can be a affordable and convenient way to get around, with approximate costs ranging from $5 to $20, depending on the route and class of service.\n\n[SECTION] City Transport [/SECTION]\n| Mode | Available In | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metro/Subway | Bangkok, Chiang Mai | $0.60-$1.20 | Convenient and efficient |\n| City Bus | Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Phuket | $0.20-$1.00 | Affordable and frequent |\n| Taxi | everywhere | $1.50-$3.00/km | Widely available, but be sure to use meter |\n| Ride-Hailing | Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Phuket | $3.00-$6.00 | Convenient and affordable |\n| Tuk-tuk/Rickshaw | Bangkok, Chiang Mai | $3.00-$6.00 | Traditional and fun, but be sure to agree on price |\n\n[SECTION] Driving [/SECTION]\n- To drive in Thailand, you will need to obtain a **Thai driver's license** or use an **International Driving Permit**.\n- Road conditions in Thailand can be **poor**, especially on rural roads, so be sure to drive defensively and slowly.\n- Fuel costs in Thailand are relatively **low**, with gasoline prices averaging around $0.80 per liter.\n- Car rental companies such as **Avis** and **Hertz** operate in major cities, but be sure to research and compare prices before booking.\n- When driving in Thailand, be aware of **hazards** such as poor road conditions, aggressive drivers, and pedestrians and motorbikes on the road.\n- It's also a good idea to **purchase insurance** to protect yourself against accidents and theft.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be sure to **agree on the price** before taking a taxi or tuk-tuk, and use the meter if possible.\n- **Avoid scams** by being cautious of overly friendly strangers who approach you at airports or bus stations.\n- **Download ride-hailing apps** such as Grab to make it easier to get around cities.\n- **Learn some basic Thai phrases**, such as \"hello\" (sawatdee) and \"thank you\" (khop khun krap), to help you communicate with locals.\n- **Be respectful** of Thai culture and customs, especially when visiting temples or attending cultural events.\n- **Stay safe** by avoiding traveling alone at night and being aware of your surroundings, especially in crowded areas.\n- **Use reputable transportation companies** and avoid taking risks when traveling, such as getting into unmarked taxis or taking unlicensed buses.",
