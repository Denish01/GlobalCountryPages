The country's culinary identity is shaped by its geographical location, with influences from Chinese, Indian, and Southeast Asian cuisines. Thai food is often characterized by the use of fresh ingredients, such as lemongrass, galangal, and chilies, which are combined with fermented fish sauce, lime juice, and palm sugar to create a unique flavor profile. Regional variations in Thai cuisine are also significant, with dishes from the north, northeast, and south of the country showcasing distinct flavors and ingredients.\n\nThe use of **street food** and **night markets** is an integral part of Thai food culture, with many popular dishes originating from these informal vendors. The concept of **\"aharn tam sang\"** or \"food to order\" is also common, where customers can choose from a variety of dishes and ingredients to create their own personalized meal. Thai cuisine is also closely tied to the country's cultural and spiritual practices, with many dishes served at festivals and ceremonies throughout the year.\n\nIn addition to its bold flavors and aromas, Thai cuisine is also known for its beautiful presentation and garnishes, which often feature fresh herbs, edible flowers, and intricately carved vegetables. The art of **\"krua\"** or Thai cooking is highly respected, with many chefs undergoing rigorous training and apprenticeships to master the techniques and recipes passed down through generations.\n\n[SECTION] Must-Try Dishes [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Dish | Type | Description | Where to Find |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Pad Thai | Stir-fry | Rice noodles, eggs, and
