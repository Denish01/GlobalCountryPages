The provinces are grouped into five main regions: Northern, Northeastern, Eastern, Central, and Southern. Each region has its own distinct cultural, economic, and geographical characteristics, shaped by the country's history, climate, and geography. The provinces are responsible for delivering public services, collecting taxes, and implementing national policies at the local level.\n\nThe administrative divisions in Thailand play a crucial role in maintaining the country's stability and promoting development. The provinces are headed by governors appointed by the central government, while the districts and sub-districts are administered by local officials.
