Thailand has a moderate visa policy, requiring citizens of certain countries to obtain a visa prior to arrival, while others are eligible for visa-free entry or can obtain a visa on arrival.

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Thailand's visa policy is considered moderate, with a mix of visa-free access, visa on arrival, and required visas prior to arrival. Citizens of around 60 countries, including many European and Asian nations, are eligible for visa-free entry, with stays ranging from 14 to 90 days. Thailand aims to balance the need to control immigration with the desire to promote tourism and economic development.

Thailand's visa policy is designed to facilitate travel and business while maintaining national security and public safety. The country has introduced various types of visas, including tourist, business, student, and work visas, each with its own set of requirements and regulations. The Thai government periodically reviews and updates its visa policy to respond to changing global circumstances and to streamline procedures for legitimate travelers.

[SECTION] Entry Points & Procedures [/SECTION]
Thailand has several main airports, including Suvarnabhumi Airport (BKK) in Bangkok and Phuket International Airport (HKT) in Phuket. Land borders with neighboring countries, such as Myanmar, Laos, and Cambodia, are also popular entry points. Upon arrival, visitors must proceed to the immigration counter and present their travel documents, including their passport and visa (if required). Immigration officers will review the documents and ask questions to verify the purpose and duration of the visit. Visitors must also declare any goods they are bringing into the country and comply with customs regulations.

Thailand has introduced an automated passport control system at some airports, which can speed up the immigration process for eligible travelers. However, visitors should still be prepared to present their documents and answer questions from immigration officers.
