[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Thailand has a **universal healthcare system**, which provides comprehensive medical coverage to all its citizens. The system is a mix of public and private healthcare providers, with the public sector being the primary provider of healthcare services. The quality of care in Thailand is generally **excellent**, with many hospitals and medical facilities equipped with modern technology and staffed by well-trained medical professionals. However, there is a significant disparity in the quality of care between urban and rural areas, with urban areas like Bangkok and Chiang Mai having better-equipped hospitals and more specialized medical professionals. In rural areas, access to healthcare can be limited, and the quality of care may be lower due to a shortage of medical professionals and limited resources.

The public healthcare system in Thailand is funded by the government and provides free or low-cost medical care to all citizens. The private healthcare sector is also well-developed, with many private hospitals and clinics offering high-quality medical care, often at a higher cost than public facilities. Many private hospitals in Thailand are accredited by international organizations, such as the **Joint Commission International (JCI)**, which ensures that they meet international standards for quality and safety.

Thailand's healthcare system is also supported by a network of **community health centers** and **rural health stations**, which provide primary healthcare services to rural communities. These facilities are staffed by medical professionals, including doctors, nurses, and community health workers, who provide basic medical care, health education, and disease prevention services.
