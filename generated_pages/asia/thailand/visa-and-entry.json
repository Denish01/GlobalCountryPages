The country has introduced various types of visas, including tourist, business, student, and work visas, each with its own set of requirements and regulations. The Thai government periodically reviews and updates its visa policy to respond to changing global circumstances and to streamline procedures for legitimate travelers.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | No | Visa-Free | 30 days | Can enter Thailand without a visa for tourism or business purposes |\n| UK Citizens | No | Visa-Free | 30 days | Eligible for visa-free entry, but must meet certain requirements |\n| EU Citizens | No | Visa-Free | 30-90 days | Varies by country, with some EU nations eligible for 90-day stays |\n| Canadian Citizens | No | Visa-Free | 30 days | Can enter Thailand without a visa for tourism or business purposes |\n| Australian Citizens | No | Visa-Free | 30 days | Eligible for visa-free entry, but must meet certain requirements |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | eVisa | 30-60 days | Must apply for an eVisa prior to arrival |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Visa Required | 30-60 days | Must apply for a visa at a Thai embassy or consulate prior to arrival |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can enter Thailand without a visa for up to 30 days, depending on their nationality.
