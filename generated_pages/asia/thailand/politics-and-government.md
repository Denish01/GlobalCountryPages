[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
Thailand's government is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **executive branch** is headed by the prime minister, who is responsible for appointing ministers and overseeing the administration of the government. The **legislative branch** is composed of the National Assembly, which is a bicameral parliament consisting of the House of Representatives and the Senate. The **judicial branch** is independent and composed of various courts, including the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Court, and the Courts of Appeal. Thailand's system of government is unitary, with a strong central government and limited regional autonomy.

The separation of powers is enshrined in the Thai Constitution, which provides checks and balances on the power of each branch. The Constitution also guarantees certain **fundamental rights**, such as freedom of speech, assembly, and the press. However, these rights have been restricted in practice, particularly during periods of military rule or political unrest. Thailand's political system has been marked by periods of instability and **military intervention**, with the most recent coup occurring in 2014.

Thailand's government has also been influenced by the **monarchy**, which plays a significant role in the country's politics and society. The monarch serves as a unifying figure and a symbol of national identity, and is also responsible for appointing the prime minister and other high-ranking officials. However, the monarch's role has been the subject of controversy and debate, particularly in recent years.
