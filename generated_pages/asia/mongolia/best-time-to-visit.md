[CALLOUT] Best months to visit Mongolia: June to August. Peak season: June to August. Budget season: April to May and September to October. Avoid: January to February and November to December due to harsh winter conditions and limited tourist infrastructure. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Mongolia has a continental climate with four distinct seasons, characterized by extreme temperature fluctuations between summer and winter. The country can be divided into several climate zones, including the **Gobi Desert** in the south, which is known for its extreme heat and cold, and the **Khentii Mountains** in the east, which have a more temperate climate. The dry season, which runs from September to May, is marked by limited precipitation, while the wet season, from June to August, brings most of the country's annual rainfall. The seasons have a significant impact on travel, with the summer months offering the best conditions for outdoor activities and the winter months making it challenging to access rural areas.

The **Trans-Mongolian Railway**, which connects Ulaanbaatar to Beijing and Moscow, is a popular way to travel to Mongolia, but it can be affected by the seasons. During the winter months, the railway can be closed due to heavy snow and freezing temperatures, while the summer months bring more frequent and reliable train schedules. The country's **Naadam Festival**, which takes place in July, is a major tourist attraction, but it can also make travel more challenging due to the large crowds and higher prices.

The seasonal variations also impact the country's **wildlife**, with many animals migrating to different areas in search of food and shelter. The summer months are the best time to see the country's **nomadic herders**, who move their animals to the high pastures during this time. The **Altai Mountains** in the west are home to a variety of wildlife, including **snow leopards**, **ibex**, and **eagles**, which can be seen during the summer months.
