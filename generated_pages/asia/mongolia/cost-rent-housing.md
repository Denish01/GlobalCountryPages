[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Mongolia's rental market is relatively underdeveloped, with a limited supply of modern apartments, especially in the city center of Ulaanbaatar. Typical lease terms range from 6-12 months, with a deposit requirement of 1-2 months' rent. Tenant rights are not well-established, and renters often have limited protection against **eviction** or **rent increases**. Compared to its regional neighbors, Russia and China, Mongolia's housing costs are relatively low, but the country's **inflation rate** of 6.2% can affect the affordability of housing. The government has implemented policies to increase the supply of affordable housing, but the demand for housing, particularly in the city center, remains high.

The housing market in Mongolia is also influenced by the country's **economic growth**, which has been driven by the mining and agriculture sectors. The government's efforts to diversify the economy and increase foreign investment have led to an increase in demand for housing, particularly in the city center. However, the lack of infrastructure and **utilities** in some areas can make it challenging for renters to find suitable housing. Additionally, the **out-of-pocket health spend** of 48.8% can be a significant burden for renters, who may have to prioritize their healthcare expenses over their housing costs.
