Typical lease terms range from 6-12 months, with a deposit requirement of 1-2 months' rent. Tenant rights are not well-established, and renters often have limited protection against **eviction** or **rent increases**. Compared to its regional neighbors, Russia and China, Mongolia's housing costs are relatively low, but the country's **inflation rate** of 6.2% can affect the affordability of housing. The government has implemented policies to increase the supply of affordable housing, but the demand for housing, particularly in the city center, remains high.\n\nThe housing market in Mongolia is also influenced by the country's **economic growth**, which has been driven by the mining and agriculture sectors. The government's efforts to diversify the economy and increase foreign investment have led to an increase in demand for housing, particularly in the city center. However, the lack of infrastructure and **utilities** in some areas can make it challenging for renters to find suitable housing. Additionally, the **out-of-pocket health spend** of 48.8% can be a significant burden for renters, who may have to prioritize their healthcare expenses over their housing costs.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $150-$300 | $80-$200 | basic amenities, shared kitchen and bathroom |\n| 1 Bedroom | $200-$500 | $100-$300 | modern appliances, private kitchen and bathroom |\n| 2 Bedroom | $300-$700 | $150-$400 | spacious living area, private kitchen and bathroom |\n| 3 Bedroom | $500-$1,200 | $200-$600 | luxurious amenities, private kitchen and bathroom |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $1,000-$2,500 | prime locations, modern amenities |\n| Suburbs | $500-$1,500 | residential areas, basic amenities |\n| Rural | $100-$500 | limited amenities, traditional housing |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Sukhbaatar District**: $200-$500 USD per month, modern apartments, close to city center\n- **Chingeltei District**: $150-$300 USD per month, traditional housing, vibrant nightlife\n- **Bayanzurkh District**: $100-$250 USD per month, residential area, basic amenities\n- **Khan-Uul District**: $80-$200 USD per month, suburban area, limited amenities\n- **Nalaikh District**: $50-$150 USD per month, rural area, traditional housing\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Mongolia [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods thoroughly to find the best value for your budget\n- Work with a reputable **real estate agent** to find a suitable apartment\n- Be prepared to **negotiate** the rent and deposit\n- **Inspect** the apartment carefully before signing a lease\n- **Utilities**, such as electricity and water, are usually not included in the rent\n- Furnished apartments are less common, but can be found in the city center\n- Be aware of **scams** and never pay a deposit without a signed lease agreement",
