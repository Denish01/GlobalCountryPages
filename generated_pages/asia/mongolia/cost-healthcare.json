The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to private healthcare, with limited resources and outdated equipment. However, public healthcare is generally more affordable, with many services being free or low-cost for citizens. For foreigners, private healthcare is often the preferred option, as it offers higher quality care and more modern facilities. While health insurance is not mandatory in Mongolia, it is highly recommended, especially for foreigners, as medical costs can be high and unpredictable.\n\nThe healthcare system in Mongolia is generally divided into three tiers: primary care, secondary care, and tertiary care. Primary care is provided by community health centers and family medicine clinics, while secondary care is provided by hospitals and specialized clinics. Tertiary care is provided by specialized hospitals and research centers. For locals, the healthcare system is generally accessible and affordable, with many services being covered by the government. However, for foreigners, the system can be more complex, and health insurance is often necessary to cover the high costs of medical care.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $5-$10 | $20-$50 | Public hospitals may have long wait times |\n| Specialist Consultation | $10-$20 | $50-$100 | Private clinics may offer more specialized care |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-$20 | $30-$50 | Private dental clinics may offer more modern equipment |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$20 | $20-$50 | Private clinics may offer more comprehensive eye exams |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $20-$50 | Private labs may offer faster results and more comprehensive testing |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $20-$50 | Public hospitals may have limited resources |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $20-$50 | Private hospitals may offer more comfortable accommodations |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$1,000 | Private hospitals may offer more modern equipment and specialized care |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $500-$1,000 | Private hospitals may offer more comprehensive maternity care |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | Private clinics may offer more modern equipment and faster results |\n| X-Ray | $10-$20 | Public hospitals may have older equipment |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Covers basic medical services, including doctor visits and hospital stays |\n| Comprehensive Private | $50-$100 | Covers more comprehensive medical services, including specialist consultations and surgeries |\n| International / Expat | $100-$200 | Covers medical services, including emergency evacuations and repatriations |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medication can be purchased at pharmacies with a doctor's prescription, with costs ranging from $5-$20 per medication\n- Over-the-counter medication is widely available at pharmacies and supermarkets, with costs ranging from $2-$10 per medication\n- Pharmacies are generally well-stocked, but may not always have the latest or most specialized medications\n- Some medications may be available in generic form, which can be more affordable\n- Prescription rules are generally strict, with medications only being dispensed with a valid prescription\n- Pharmacy availability is generally good, with many pharmacies located in urban areas\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the emergency number 103, which will connect you to the local emergency services.

The best hospitals for foreigners in Ulaanbaatar include the **Mongolian-Japanese Hospital** and the **Intermed Hospital**, which offer a range of medical services, including emergency care and specialized treatments.\n\nFor emergency care, it is generally recommended to have some knowledge of Mongolian, as not all medical staff may speak English. However, many private hospitals and clinics have English-speaking staff, and may offer translation services for foreign patients. It is also recommended to have health insurance, which can cover the costs of emergency medical care, including ambulance services and hospital stays. In the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to remain calm and to seek medical attention as soon as possible, as delays in treatment can have serious consequences.",
