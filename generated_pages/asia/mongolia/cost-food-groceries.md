[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Mongolia's food prices are generally higher than the regional average due to its landlocked location and limited agricultural production, which results in a significant portion of food being imported. The country's **inflation rate** of 6.2% in 2024 also contributes to the increasing food prices. However, eating out is a common practice in Mongolia, especially in the capital city of Ulaanbaatar, where a wide range of restaurants serving both traditional Mongolian and international cuisine can be found. In contrast, home cooking is also prevalent, with many locals opting to prepare traditional dishes such as **boortsog** (fried dough) and **khorkhog** (barbecued meat) at home.

The prices of food in Mongolia can be driven up or down by various factors, including the **GDP per capita PPP** of $19,145 in 2024, which indicates a relatively high standard of living. Additionally, the country's **health expenditure per capita** of $360 in 2023 and **out-of-pocket health spend** of 48.8% in 2023 may also influence food prices. The **education spend** of 3.7% of GDP in 2023 may have an indirect impact on food prices, as it can affect the overall economy and consumer spending. Overall, the food prices in Mongolia reflect a combination of these factors, resulting in a unique and dynamic market.

[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]
The prices of groceries in Mongolia can vary significantly depending on whether you shop at a supermarket or a local market. Supermarkets tend to have a wider selection of products, including imported goods, but prices are generally higher. Local markets, on the other hand, offer fresh produce and traditional products at lower prices, but the selection may be limited. For example, a kilogram of apples may cost $3.00 USD at a supermarket, while at a local market, the same kilogram may cost $2.00 USD. When shopping at local markets, it's common to **haggle** over prices, especially for produce and meat.

In general, it's recommended to buy fresh produce, meat, and traditional products at local markets, while supermarkets are better for packaged goods, dairy products, and imported items. Some popular local markets in Ulaanbaatar include the **Naran Tuul Market** and the **Black Market**, where you can find a wide range of products at competitive prices. When shopping at local markets, be sure to **bargain** and compare prices among different vendors to get the best deal.
