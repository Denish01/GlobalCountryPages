[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Mongolia is divided into three main stages: primary, secondary, and tertiary education. Primary education, which lasts for 5 years, focuses on basic skills such as reading, writing, and mathematics. Secondary education, which lasts for 7 years, is further divided into lower and upper secondary education, with students having the option to pursue vocational training or academic studies. Tertiary education, which includes universities and colleges, offers a range of academic programs, including **bachelor's**, **master's**, and **doctoral degrees**. The quality of education in Mongolia has improved significantly in recent years, with a strong emphasis on **science**, **technology**, **engineering**, and **mathematics (STEM)** education.

The education system in Mongolia is predominantly public, with the government providing free education to all citizens. However, there are also private schools and universities that offer alternative educational options. The public education system is generally considered to be of good quality, with well-qualified teachers and a comprehensive curriculum. Private schools and universities, on the other hand, often offer more specialized programs and better facilities, but at a higher cost.

Despite the progress made in recent years, the education system in Mongolia still faces several challenges, including a shortage of qualified teachers, limited resources, and inadequate infrastructure. Additionally, there are significant disparities in access to education between urban and rural areas, with rural areas often having limited access to quality educational facilities and resources.
