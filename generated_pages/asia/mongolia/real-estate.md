[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The property market in Mongolia has experienced significant growth in recent years, driven by the country's mining boom and increasing foreign investment. The market is largely centered in the capital city, Ulaanbaatar, where demand for housing and office space is high. However, the market is still relatively underdeveloped, and prices can be volatile. The current market conditions are characterized by a shortage of high-quality housing and commercial properties, which has driven up prices in recent years. The price trajectory is expected to continue upward, driven by the country's growing economy and increasing demand for housing and commercial space.

In terms of urban vs rural areas, the property market in Mongolia is largely focused on urban areas, particularly Ulaanbaatar. The city is home to the majority of the country's population and is the center of the country's economy. However, there are also opportunities for investment in rural areas, particularly in the tourism and agriculture sectors. The government has implemented policies to encourage investment in rural areas, including tax incentives and infrastructure development.

The property market in Mongolia is also characterized by a lack of transparency and a limited number of qualified real estate professionals. This can make it difficult for foreigners to navigate the market and find reliable partners. However, the government has taken steps to improve the regulatory framework and increase transparency, which is expected to attract more foreign investment in the future.
