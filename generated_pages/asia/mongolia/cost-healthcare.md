[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Mongolia's healthcare system is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to private healthcare, with limited resources and outdated equipment. However, public healthcare is generally more affordable, with many services being free or low-cost for citizens. For foreigners, private healthcare is often the preferred option, as it offers higher quality care and more modern facilities. While health insurance is not mandatory in Mongolia, it is highly recommended, especially for foreigners, as medical costs can be high and unpredictable.

The healthcare system in Mongolia is generally divided into three tiers: primary care, secondary care, and tertiary care. Primary care is provided by community health centers and family medicine clinics, while secondary care is provided by hospitals and specialized clinics. Tertiary care is provided by specialized hospitals and research centers. For locals, the healthcare system is generally accessible and affordable, with many services being covered by the government. However, for foreigners, the system can be more complex, and health insurance is often necessary to cover the high costs of medical care.

In the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to call the emergency number 103, which will connect you to the local emergency services. Ambulance services are available, but may be limited in rural areas. For foreigners, it is recommended to go to a private hospital, which will offer more comprehensive and modern emergency care. The best hospitals for foreigners in Ulaanbaatar include the **Mongolian-Japanese Hospital** and the **Intermed Hospital**, which offer a range of medical services, including emergency care and specialized treatments.

For emergency care, it is generally recommended to have some knowledge of Mongolian, as not all medical staff may speak English. However, many private hospitals and clinics have English-speaking staff, and may offer translation services for foreign patients. It is also recommended to have health insurance, which can cover the costs of emergency medical care, including ambulance services and hospital stays. In the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to remain calm and to seek medical attention as soon as possible, as delays in treatment can have serious consequences.
