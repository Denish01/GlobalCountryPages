[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Mongolia has a lower-middle-income economy with a high level of dependence on the mining sector. The country's economic classification is driven by its vast mineral resources, including coal, copper, gold, and uranium. The development level of the economy is still in the process of transitioning from a centrally planned to a market-based economy. The economic trajectory of Mongolia is expected to be driven by the growth of the mining sector, as well as the development of other industries such as agriculture and services.

The economy of Mongolia has been growing rapidly over the past two decades, with an average annual growth rate of 7%. However, the economy is also vulnerable to fluctuations in global commodity prices, as well as weather-related risks such as droughts and extreme cold. The government has been implementing policies to diversify the economy and reduce its dependence on the mining sector. One of the key priorities is to develop the country's infrastructure, including transportation networks, energy systems, and telecommunications.

The economic system of Mongolia is a mixed economy, with a combination of state-owned and private enterprises. The government plays a significant role in the economy, particularly in the mining sector, where state-owned enterprises are dominant. However, the private sector is also growing rapidly, particularly in the services and agriculture sectors. The government has been implementing policies to promote private sector development, including tax incentives and investment promotion.
