Mongolia is generally a safe country to visit, with low crime rates compared to other countries. The capital city, Ulaanbaatar, is a bustling metropolis with a mix of traditional and modern culture, and most tourists find it to be a welcoming and safe place. However, as with any country, there are some areas that are considered safer than others, and tourists should take normal precautions to ensure their safety. The country's vast rural areas can be quite remote, and travelers should be prepared for limited access to medical facilities and other services.
