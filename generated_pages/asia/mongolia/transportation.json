The airport receives direct flights from major hubs such as Beijing, Seoul, and Moscow, as well as connecting flights from other Asian and European cities. Overland entry points are also available, with border crossings from Russia and China, although these options may require more time and planning.\n\nFor those traveling overland, the most common entry points are at the border towns of Zamyn-Uud (from China) and Altanbulag (from Russia). There are also bus services available from neighboring countries, although these may not always be reliable or frequent. It's essential to research and plan ahead when entering Mongolia by land, as facilities and services may be limited at border crossings.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nMongolia's domestic air network is moderate, with several airlines operating flights between major cities, including Ulaanbaatar, Dalanzadgad, and Khovd. The main domestic airlines are **MIAT Mongolian Airlines** and **Hunnu Air**, which offer regular flights to various destinations throughout the country. Booking in advance is recommended, especially during peak travel seasons, as flights can fill up quickly. Approximate costs for domestic flights range from $50 to $200, depending on the route and airline.\n\nWhen booking domestic flights, it's a good idea to check with the airlines for any special promotions or discounts, as well as to confirm flight schedules and prices.

The rail network is mostly used for freight transport, but there are some passenger trains available, including the **Trans-Mongolian Railway** and the **Ulaanbaatar-Irkutsk Railway**. The trains are generally slow and not very comfortable, but they offer a unique way to see the countryside. Booking train tickets can be done through the railway station or through a travel agency, and it's recommended to book in advance, especially during peak travel seasons.\n\nThere are no high-speed train options available in Mongolia, and the trains can be quite slow, with average speeds of around 50-60 km/h. However, the scenic views of the Mongolian countryside can make up for the slow pace, and the train ride can be a memorable experience.\n\n[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]\nMongolia has a network of intercity buses and coaches that connect major cities and towns, including Ulaanbaatar, Dalanzadgad, and Khovd.

The main bus companies are **Mongol Post** and **Ulaanbaatar Bus Station**, which offer regular services to various destinations throughout the country. Costs for bus travel range from $5 to $20, depending on the route and type of bus.\n\nWhen traveling by bus, it's a good idea to check the schedule and prices in advance, as well as to book tickets early to secure a seat.
