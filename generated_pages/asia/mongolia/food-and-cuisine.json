The cuisine has been influenced by Chinese, Russian, and Tibetan flavors, resulting in a unique blend of spices, meats, and noodles. Regional variations exist, with the Gobi Desert region favoring more simple, dried ingredients, while the northern regions incorporate more fish and game meats. In general, Mongolian cuisine is centered around meat, particularly beef, mutton, and goat, which are often cooked in a variety of ways, including boiling, grilling, and stewing.\n\nThe country's nomadic heritage is also reflected in its use of dairy products, such as airag (fermented horse milk) and aaruul (dried curd), which are staples in many Mongolian households. The cuisine is also known for its use of noodles, particularly **Budaaatai Khuurga**, a type of noodle soup. In larger cities, such as Ulaanbaatar, a wider range of international cuisines is available, including Chinese, Korean, and European options.\n\nMongolian cuisine is often associated with traditional **Ger** (yurt) cooking, where meals are prepared over an open flame, using simple, locally-sourced ingredients. This style of cooking is still prevalent in rural areas, where families gather to share meals and socialize. In urban areas, modern restaurants and cafes have emerged, offering a range of traditional and contemporary Mongolian dishes, as well as international options.\n\n[SECTION] Must-Try Dishes [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Dish | Type | Description | Where to Find |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Boortsog | Pastry | Fried dough pastry, often served with tea or coffee | Traditional restaurants, bakeries |\n| Khorkhog | BBQ | Grilled mutton, served with noodles and vegetables | Outdoor BBQ restaurants, Ger camps |\n| Budaaatai Khuurga | Noodle Soup | Hearty noodle soup, made with beef, vegetables, and noodles | Local eateries, food courts |\n| Aaruul | Snack | Dried curd, often served as a snack or used in salads | Markets, street vendors |\n| Khorkhog Tsagaan | Stew | Mutton stew, served with noodles and vegetables | Traditional restaurants, Ger camps |\n| Buuz | Dumpling | Steamed dumpling, filled with meat and vegetables | Local eateries, food courts |\n| Ul Boov | Pastry | Layered pastry, filled with meat and vegetables | Traditional restaurants, bakeries |\n| Shashlik | Skewers | Grilled meat skewers, served with noodles and vegetables | Outdoor BBQ restaurants, street vendors |\n| Tsampa | Porridge | Roasted barley porridge, often served with tea or milk | Local eateries, traditional restaurants |\n| Khorkhog Bortsg | Salad | Mutton salad, made with boiled mutton, onions, and noodles | Traditional restaurants, Ger camps |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Street Food & Snacks [/SECTION]\n- **Boortsog**: fried dough pastry, $1-2 USD\n- **Aaruul**: dried curd, $2-3 USD\n- **Shashlik**: grilled meat skewers, $3-5 USD\n- **Khuushuur**: fried meat pastry, $2-3 USD\n- **Budaaatai Khuurga**: noodle soup, $3-5 USD\n- **Ul Boov**: layered pastry, $2-3 USD\n- **Tsampa**: roasted barley porridge, $1-2 USD\n- **Airag**: fermented horse milk, $2-3 USD\n\n[SECTION] Drinks [/SECTION]\n- **Airag**: fermented horse milk, a traditional Mongolian beverage\n- **Suutei Tsai**: milk tea, a popular breakfast drink\n- **Kumis**: fermented mare's milk, a sour, slightly effervescent drink\n- **Chinggis**: Mongolian vodka, often served with meals or as a shot\n- **Mongolian beer**: a range of local beers, including **Chinggis** and **Khan Brau**\n- **Fresh juice**: a range of fruit juices, including sea buckthorn and berry juice\n\n[SECTION] Dining Customs [/SECTION]\n- **Eating with hands**: it is acceptable to eat with your hands, particularly when eating traditional dishes like **Boortsog** or **Khorkhog**\n- **Using chopsticks**: in some restaurants, particularly Chinese or Korean eateries, chopsticks may be used\n- **Tipping**: 10% in tourist areas, not expected in local eateries\n- **Dress code**: casual, although some higher-end restaurants may require more formal attire\n- **Reservations**: not always necessary, although recommended for larger groups or special occasions\n- **Table manners**: it is customary to wait for the host to start eating before beginning your meal\n\n[SECTION] Where to Eat [/SECTION]\n- **Traditional restaurants**: serving traditional Mongolian dishes, such as **Boortsog** and **Khorkhog**\n- **Food courts**: offering a range of local and international options, including **Budaaatai Khuurga** and **Shashlik**\n- **Markets**: selling fresh produce, meats, and dairy products, as well as prepared foods like **Aaruul** and **Khuushuur**\n- **Ger camps**: offering traditional **Ger**-style cooking and meals\n- **Cafes**: serving coffee, tea, and pastries, including **Boortsog** and **Ul Boov**\n\n[SECTION] Food Markets & Food Experiences [/SECTION]\n- **Naran Tuul Market**: a large market in Ulaanbaatar, selling fresh produce, meats, and dairy products\n- **Gobi Desert Food Festival**: an annual festival, showcasing traditional Gobi Desert cuisine\n- **Naadam Festival Food Stalls**: food stalls selling traditional Mongolian dishes, such as **Boortsog** and **Khorkhog**, during the Naadam Festival\n- **Ger Camp Dining Experience**: a traditional **Ger**-style dining experience, offering local cuisine and hospitality\n- **Mongolian Culinary Tour**: a guided tour, exploring the country's culinary heritage and traditions",
