[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Mongolia's healthcare system is primarily funded by the government, with some private providers offering specialized services. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality, with limited resources and outdated equipment, while private providers offer better quality care but at a higher cost. In urban areas, such as **Ulaanbaatar**, there are more healthcare options available, including private hospitals and clinics, while in rural areas, access to healthcare is often limited. The quality of care in Mongolia is also influenced by the country's **geographical location**, with many areas being remote and difficult to access.

The Mongolian government has implemented various initiatives to improve the healthcare system, including the introduction of a **universal health insurance** scheme, which provides coverage for all citizens. However, the scheme has been criticized for being underfunded and ineffective in providing adequate coverage. Despite these challenges, Mongolia has made significant progress in improving its healthcare system, with a focus on **primary healthcare** and **prevention**.

In terms of **healthcare access**, Mongolia has a significant disparity between urban and rural areas. While urban areas have a relatively high concentration of healthcare providers, rural areas often have limited access to healthcare services. This can make it difficult for people living in rural areas to receive timely and effective medical care.
