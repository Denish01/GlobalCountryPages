  "content": "Mongolia is generally cheaper than Russia, with an overall cost of living that is around 20-30% lower.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMongolia GDP per Capita (PPP): 14,240\nRussia GDP per Capita (PPP): 29,181\nMongolia Inflation Rate: 6.4\nRussia Inflation Rate: 4.3\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Mongolia\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Mongolia vs Russia [/SECTION]\nMongolia and Russia are two neighboring countries with distinct economic profiles. Mongolia, a smaller and less populous country, has a more limited economy, which contributes to its lower cost of living. The country's GDP per capita is significantly lower than Russia's, and its inflation rate is slightly higher. In contrast, Russia has a more diversified economy, with a strong energy sector, which drives up prices. Overall, Mongolia offers a more affordable lifestyle, with lower prices for housing, food, and transportation.\n\nThe cost difference between Mongolia and Russia is significant, with Mongolia being around 20-30% cheaper. This is especially noticeable in the cost of housing, where a one-bedroom apartment in Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia, can cost around $200-300 per month, compared to $500-700 per month in Moscow, the capital of Russia. Additionally, the cost of food and transportation in Mongolia is also lower, making it an attractive option for expats, students, and retirees looking for an affordable lifestyle.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Mongolia (USD) | Russia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 250 | 600 | 58% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 150 | 400 | 62% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 400 | 1,200 | 66% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Mongolia (USD) | Russia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 5 | 10 | 50% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 100 | 200 | 50% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | 2 | 3 | 33% cheaper |\n| Coffee | 1.50 | 2.50 | 40% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Mongolia (USD) | Russia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 10 | 20 | 50% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | 0.50 | 1.00 | 50% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 0.80 | 1.20 | 33% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Mongolia (USD) | Russia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 50 | 100 | 50% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 20 | 30 | 33% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | 10 | 20 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Mongolia (USD) | Russia (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 400 | 700 | 43% |\n| Mid-Range | 700 | 1,200 | 42% |\n| Comfortable | 1,200 | 2,500 | 52% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Mongolia is cheaper for:**\n- Rent and housing, with prices up to 60% lower than in Russia\n- Food and dining, with meal prices up to 50% lower\n- Transportation, with fuel and taxi prices up to 50% lower\n- Utilities and internet, with prices up to 50% lower\n- **Russia is cheaper for:**\n- Certain luxury goods, which may be more widely available and cheaper in Russia\n- International travel, with more flight options and competitive prices from Russian airports\n- Entertainment, with a wider range of cultural and recreational activities available in Russia\n- High-end education and healthcare, with more options and higher quality services in Russia\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nFor expats, students, and retirees looking for an affordable lifestyle, Mongolia offers a more attractive option, with lower prices for housing, food, and transportation.
