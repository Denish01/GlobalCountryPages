  "content": "Mongolia's healthcare system is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering a range of services, although the quality of care can vary significantly depending on the location and type of facility.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nQuality Rating: 2/5\nEmergency Number: 103\nHospital Standard: Basic\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: moderate\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nMongolia's healthcare system is primarily funded by the government, with some private providers offering specialized services. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality, with limited resources and outdated equipment, while private providers offer better quality care but at a higher cost. In urban areas, such as **Ulaanbaatar**, there are more healthcare options available, including private hospitals and clinics, while in rural areas, access to healthcare is often limited. The quality of care in Mongolia is also influenced by the country's **geographical location**, with many areas being remote and difficult to access.\n\nThe Mongolian government has implemented various initiatives to improve the healthcare system, including the introduction of a **universal health insurance** scheme, which provides coverage for all citizens. However, the scheme has been criticized for being underfunded and ineffective in providing adequate coverage. Despite these challenges, Mongolia has made significant progress in improving its healthcare system, with a focus on **primary healthcare** and **prevention**.\n\nIn terms of **healthcare access**, Mongolia has a significant disparity between urban and rural areas. While urban areas have a relatively high concentration of healthcare providers, rural areas often have limited access to healthcare services. This can make it difficult for people living in rural areas to receive timely and effective medical care.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Central Hospital | Ulaanbaatar | Public | General medicine, surgery | Limited |\n| Intermed Hospital | Ulaanbaatar | Private | Cardiology, oncology | Yes |\n| Mongolian National University of Medical Sciences Hospital | Ulaanbaatar | Public | Teaching hospital, general medicine | Limited |\n| SOS Medica Mongolia | Ulaanbaatar | Private | Emergency medicine, general practice | Yes |\n| UB International School Clinic | Ulaanbaatar | Private | General practice, pediatric care | Yes |\n| National Center for Communicable Diseases | Ulaanbaatar | Public | Infectious diseases, epidemiology | Limited |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Private health insurance** is recommended for foreigners and expats, as it can provide access to better quality care and more comprehensive coverage.\n- **Local insurance options** are available, but may not provide the same level of coverage as international insurance plans.\n- **Expats** may be required to purchase health insurance as a condition of their employment or visa.\n- **Costs** can vary widely, depending on the type and level of coverage, with basic plans starting from around 50,000 MNT per month.\n- **International insurance plans** may not be recognized by all healthcare providers in Mongolia, so it's essential to check the policy details before seeking medical care.\n- **Group insurance plans** may be available for companies and organizations, providing a more cost-effective option for employees.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Medications** are widely available in urban areas, but may be limited in rural areas.\n- **Prescription requirements** vary depending on the type of medication, but many medications can be purchased over-the-counter.\n- **Common brands** include international pharmaceutical companies, as well as local manufacturers.\n- **Costs** can vary widely, depending on the type and brand of medication, but many medications are relatively affordable.\n- **Traditional medicine** is also widely practiced in Mongolia, with many people using herbal remedies and other alternative therapies.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Hepatitis A** and **typhoid** vaccinations are recommended for all travelers to Mongolia.\n- **Rabies** vaccination is also recommended, as the disease is prevalent in the country.\n- **Influenza** vaccination is recommended during the winter months, when the disease is more common.\n- **Tick-borne diseases**, such as Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis, are present in some areas of the country.\n- **Water safety** is a concern, with many areas having limited access to clean drinking water.\n- **Food safety** is also a concern, with many restaurants and food vendors not following proper food handling and preparation procedures.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **Dental care** is a popular medical tourism option in Mongolia, with many clinics offering affordable and high-quality services.\n- **Cosmetic surgery** is also available, with some clinics offering a range of procedures, including plastic surgery and dermatology.\n- **Accredited hospitals** include the Intermed Hospital and the SOS Medica Mongolia clinic, which offer a range of medical services, including emergency care and general medicine.\n- **Cost savings** can be significant, with many medical procedures costing 50-70% less than in Western countries.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- **Ambulance services** are available in urban areas, but may be limited in rural areas.\n- **Emergency rooms** are available at many hospitals, but may not always have English-speaking staff.\n- **Nearest hospitals** can be found by contacting the **Mongolian Ministry of Health**, which can provide information on healthcare facilities and services.\n- **Insurance claims** can be complex and time-consuming, so it's essential to have a good understanding of the policy details and procedures.\n- **Emergency contact numbers** include the **emergency number** 103, which can be used to contact the police, ambulance, or fire services.",
