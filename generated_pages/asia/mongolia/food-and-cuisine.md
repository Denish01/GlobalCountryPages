[SECTION] Food Culture Overview [/SECTION]
Mongolian cuisine is defined by its Nomadic traditions and the country's harsh climate, with a focus on hearty, comforting dishes that can be easily cooked over an open flame. The cuisine has been influenced by Chinese, Russian, and Tibetan flavors, resulting in a unique blend of spices, meats, and noodles. Regional variations exist, with the Gobi Desert region favoring more simple, dried ingredients, while the northern regions incorporate more fish and game meats. In general, Mongolian cuisine is centered around meat, particularly beef, mutton, and goat, which are often cooked in a variety of ways, including boiling, grilling, and stewing.

The country's nomadic heritage is also reflected in its use of dairy products, such as airag (fermented horse milk) and aaruul (dried curd), which are staples in many Mongolian households. The cuisine is also known for its use of noodles, particularly **Budaaatai Khuurga**, a type of noodle soup. In larger cities, such as Ulaanbaatar, a wider range of international cuisines is available, including Chinese, Korean, and European options.

Mongolian cuisine is often associated with traditional **Ger** (yurt) cooking, where meals are prepared over an open flame, using simple, locally-sourced ingredients. This style of cooking is still prevalent in rural areas, where families gather to share meals and socialize. In urban areas, modern restaurants and cafes have emerged, offering a range of traditional and contemporary Mongolian dishes, as well as international options.
