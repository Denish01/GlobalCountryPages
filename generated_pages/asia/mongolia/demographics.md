[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Mongolia's population is relatively small compared to its vast territory, with a population density of approximately 2.2 people per square kilometer. The country has experienced a steady population growth rate of around 1.2% per annum, with a median age of 27.5 years. The urban population accounts for about 67.4% of the total population, with the majority residing in the capital city of Ulaanbaatar. The population growth trend is expected to continue, driven by improvements in healthcare and living standards. However, the country still faces challenges related to population distribution, with a significant proportion of the population concentrated in urban areas.

The population of Mongolia has also been influenced by migration patterns, with many young people moving to urban areas in search of better job opportunities and education. This has resulted in a significant urban-rural divide, with urban areas experiencing rapid growth and development, while rural areas often lack access to basic services and infrastructure. The government has implemented policies aimed at addressing these disparities and promoting more balanced population growth.

Mongolia's population is also characterized by a high level of mobility, with many people moving seasonally between urban and rural areas in search of work or to tend to their livestock. This mobility has contributed to the country's unique cultural identity, with many people maintaining strong ties to their rural heritage and traditional ways of life.
