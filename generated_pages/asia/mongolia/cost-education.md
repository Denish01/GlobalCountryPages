[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
Mongolia's education system is divided into public and private institutions, with the public sector being the dominant provider of education. The quality of public education can vary depending on the location and availability of resources, with schools in urban areas generally being better equipped and staffed than those in rural areas. The language of instruction is Mongolian, although some schools may offer classes in English or other foreign languages. Compulsory education lasts for 12 years, from age 6 to 18, and is divided into primary, secondary, and vocational education. International schools are available in Ulaanbaatar, offering a range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate and the Cambridge International Examinations.

The education system in Mongolia is overseen by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Science and Sports, which is responsible for setting national education policies and standards. The ministry has implemented various initiatives to improve the quality of education, including teacher training programs and the introduction of new technologies in the classroom. Despite these efforts, the education system in Mongolia still faces challenges, including a shortage of qualified teachers and inadequate infrastructure in some areas.
