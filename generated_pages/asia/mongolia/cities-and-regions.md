[SECTION] How Mongolia Is Divided [/SECTION]
Mongolia is a sovereign country located in East Asia, divided into 21 provinces (aimags) and the capital city, Ulaanbaatar. The provinces are further divided into districts (sums), which are then subdivided into villages (bags) and towns. This administrative structure allows for efficient governance and management of the country's vast territory, which spans over 1.5 million square kilometers. The provinces are responsible for providing basic services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure to the local population, while the central government oversees national policies and development strategies.

The division of Mongolia into provinces and districts also reflects the country's geographical and cultural diversity. The provinces vary greatly in terms of climate, economy, and cultural heritage, with some being predominantly rural and agricultural, while others are more urban and industrial. This diversity is reflected in the country's rich cultural heritage, with each province having its unique traditions, customs, and historical landmarks.
