The country's **inflation rate** of 6.2% in 2024 also contributes to the increasing food prices. However, eating out is a common practice in Mongolia, especially in the capital city of Ulaanbaatar, where a wide range of restaurants serving both traditional Mongolian and international cuisine can be found. In contrast, home cooking is also prevalent, with many locals opting to prepare traditional dishes such as **boortsog** (fried dough) and **khorkhog** (barbecued meat) at home.\n\nThe prices of food in Mongolia can be driven up or down by various factors, including the **GDP per capita PPP** of $19,145 in 2024, which indicates a relatively high standard of living. Additionally, the country's **health expenditure per capita** of $360 in 2023 and **out-of-pocket health spend** of 48.8% in 2023 may also influence food prices. The **education spend** of 3.7% of GDP in 2023 may have an indirect impact on food prices, as it can affect the overall economy and consumer spending. Overall, the food prices in Mongolia reflect a combination of these factors, resulting in a unique and dynamic market.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $1.50 | 4,500 MNT | |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $1.20 | 3,600 MNT | |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $2.00 | 6,000 MNT | |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $1.80 | 5,400 MNT | |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $6.00 | 18,000 MNT | |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $10.00 | 30,000 MNT | |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $3.00 | 9,000 MNT | |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $2.50 | 7,500 MNT | |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $1.00 | 3,000 MNT | |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $1.20 | 3,600 MNT | |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $8.00 | 24,000 MNT | |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $1.00 | 3,000 MNT | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $3-$5 | (typical dishes such as **buuz** and **khuushuur**) |\n| Casual Restaurant | $10-$15 | (one person, 2-3 courses) |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $20-$30 | (3 courses, including **Mongolian barbecue**) |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $50-$70 | (upscale, 5-6 courses) |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $2-$3 | |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $5-$7 | |\n| Cappuccino | $3-$5 | |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $2-$3 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nThe prices of groceries in Mongolia can vary significantly depending on whether you shop at a supermarket or a local market. Supermarkets tend to have a wider selection of products, including imported goods, but prices are generally higher. Local markets, on the other hand, offer fresh produce and traditional products at lower prices, but the selection may be limited. For example, a kilogram of apples may cost $3.00 USD at a supermarket, while at a local market, the same kilogram may cost $2.00 USD. When shopping at local markets, it's common to **haggle** over prices, especially for produce and meat.\n\nIn general, it's recommended to buy fresh produce, meat, and traditional products at local markets, while supermarkets are better for packaged goods, dairy products, and imported items. Some popular local markets in Ulaanbaatar include the **Naran Tuul Market** and the **Black Market**, where you can find a wide range of products at competitive prices. When shopping at local markets, be sure to **bargain** and compare prices among different vendors to get the best deal.\n\n[SECTION] Local Food Tips [/SECTION]\n- The cheapest way to eat in Mongolia is to try **street food**, such as **buuz** (steamed dumplings) and **khuushuur** (fried dumplings), which can cost as little as $1-$2 USD per serving.\n- Local staples such as **boortsog** (fried dough) and **khorkhog** (barbecued meat) are good value and can be found at most restaurants and markets.\n- Avoid buying imported products, such as **foreign beer** and **Western-style snacks**, as they can be expensive and may not be widely available.\n- Try **Mongolian tea**, which is a traditional beverage made from milk, tea, and salt, and is often served at social gatherings.\n- **Bargain** when shopping at local markets, especially for produce and meat, to get the best prices.\n- Consider buying **local cheese** and **dried meat**, which are popular snacks and can be found at most markets and supermarkets.",
