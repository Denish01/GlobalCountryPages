However, the quality of services can still vary depending on the location, with urban areas generally having better infrastructure than rural areas. The cost of utilities in Mongolia can fluctuate due to seasonal variations, with higher costs during the winter months when heating is required. The government has implemented measures to regulate utility prices and ensure that they remain stable, but prices can still increase due to inflation and other factors.\n\nThe inflation rate in Mongolia is around 6.2%, which can impact the cost of utilities and other living expenses. To mitigate this, the government has implemented policies to reduce the financial burden on citizens, including subsidies for low-income households and price controls on essential goods and services. Despite these efforts, the cost of utilities can still be a significant expense for many households, especially during the winter months when heating costs are higher.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $50 | $80 | $120 | |\n| Water | $10 | $15 | $20 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $20 | $30 | $40 | (only applicable during winter months) |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $5 | $5 | $5 | (included in rent or paid separately) |\n| **Total** | **$85** | **$130** | **$185** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $20-30 | 10-20 Mbps | Mobicom, Unitel |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $50-70 | 50-100 Mbps | Mobicom, Unitel |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $5-10 | 1-5 GB | Mobicom, Unitel |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $10-20 | 5-10 GB | Mobicom, Unitel |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $30-50 | varies | Mobicom, Unitel |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | available in Mongolia |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | available in Mongolia |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | Mongolian streaming services available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Mongolia, it is recommended to contact the local utility providers, such as Mobicom or Unitel, and provide the necessary documentation, including a passport and proof of address.\n- Prepaid electricity plans are available in Mongolia, but postpaid plans are more common and often offer better rates.\n- The best internet providers in Mongolia are Mobicom and Unitel, which offer a range of plans and speeds to suit different needs and budgets.\n- To save on utility bills, it is recommended to use energy-efficient appliances, turn off lights and electronics when not in use, and take advantage of seasonal promotions and discounts offered by utility providers.\n- It is also recommended to negotiate with the landlord or property manager to include utility costs in the rent, as this can help to simplify the billing process and reduce administrative costs.",
