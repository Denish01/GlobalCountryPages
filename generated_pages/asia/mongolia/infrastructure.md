# Mongolia Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

Mongolia's infrastructure is still in the process of development, with significant investments being made to improve the country's roads, energy, and telecommunications, but challenges remain, particularly in rural areas.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 92% of population
Internet Penetration: 38%
Road Network: 49,250 km, moderate quality with many unpaved roads
Rail Network: 1,900 km
Major Airports: 3
Major Ports: landlocked
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Mongolia's infrastructure development level is still relatively low compared to other countries in the region. However, the government has been investing heavily in recent years to improve the country's infrastructure, with a focus on roads, energy, and telecommunications. The urban-rural gap in terms of infrastructure is significant, with **Ulaanbaatar**, the capital city, having much better roads, electricity, and water supply than rural areas. The government has been working to address this gap, with initiatives such as the **National Infrastructure Development Plan**, which aims to improve access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation in rural areas.

Despite these efforts, challenges remain, including the country's vast territory and harsh climate, which make it difficult and expensive to build and maintain infrastructure. Additionally, the country's **mining sector**, which is a significant contributor to the economy, has put a strain on existing infrastructure, particularly roads and energy supply. To address these challenges, the government has been working to attract foreign investment and to develop public-private partnerships to support infrastructure development.

The government has also been working to improve the business environment and to reduce bureaucratic hurdles to support private sector investment in infrastructure. This includes initiatives such as the **Investment Law**, which aims to simplify the investment process and to provide incentives for foreign investors. As a result, there are now several major infrastructure projects underway in Mongolia, including the development of new roads, railways, and energy facilities.

[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]
- The majority of Mongolia's **power generation** comes from coal-fired plants, which are relatively unreliable and prone to outages.
- The government has been working to **diversify the energy mix**, with a focus on renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power.
- **Energy efficiency** is a significant challenge, with many buildings and homes lacking proper insulation and heating systems.
- The government has been working to **improve the grid**, with initiatives such as the **National Grid Development Plan**, which aims to increase access to electricity and to reduce outages.
- **Renewable energy** is becoming increasingly important, with several major wind and solar farms under development, including the **Sainshand Wind Farm**, which will be one of the largest in Asia.

[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]
- **Tap water safety** is a significant concern, particularly in rural areas, where many people lack access to safe drinking water.
- **Sanitation coverage** is relatively low, with many people lacking access to proper toilets and sewage systems.
- **Water access** in rural areas is often limited, with many people relying on wells and rivers for their water supply.
- The government has been working to **improve water supply**, with initiatives such as the **National Water Supply Plan**, which aims to increase access to safe drinking water and to improve sanitation coverage.
- **Water conservation** is becoming increasingly important, with initiatives such as the **Water Conservation Program**, which aims to reduce water waste and to promote efficient use of water resources.

[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]
- **Mobile coverage** is relatively good, with several major operators providing coverage to most of the country.
- **Fiber and broadband** coverage is limited, particularly in rural areas, where many people lack access to high-speed internet.
- The government has been working to **improve telecommunications**, with initiatives such as the **National Telecommunications Plan**, which aims to increase access to mobile and internet services.
- **4G and 5G rollout** is underway, with several major operators launching new services in recent years.
- **Postal services** are relatively well-developed, with a network of post offices and mail delivery services covering most of the country.

[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]
- The **Steppe Road** project, which aims to improve the country's road network and to reduce transport costs, is currently underway.
- The **Tavan Tolgoi Railway** project, which aims to improve rail transport and to increase coal exports, is currently under development.
- The **Ulaanbaatar New Airport** project, which aims to increase air transport capacity and to improve safety, is currently underway.
- The **National Renewable Energy Plan**, which aims to increase the share of renewable energy in the energy mix, is currently being implemented.
- The **Mongolia-Russia-China Economic Corridor** project, which aims to improve transport and trade links between the three countries, is currently under development.
