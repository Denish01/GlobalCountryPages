# The Truth About Mongolia - History & Real Facts

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
Mongolia has a rich and complex history, with various empires and dynasties rising and falling over the centuries. The **Xiongnu Empire**, a nomadic confederation, was one of the earliest known empires in the region, dating back to the 3rd century BCE. In the 13th century, **Genghis Khan** united various Mongol tribes and went on to create the **Mongol Empire**, which became the largest contiguous empire in history. The empire was divided into four khanates after Genghis Khan's death, with the **Yuan Dynasty** ruling over China and Mongolia. In the 17th century, Mongolia was annexed by the **Qing Dynasty**, which ruled over the region for nearly two centuries.

Mongolia declared its independence from China in 1911, but it was not recognized by the international community until 1921, when the **Mongolian People's Republic** was established. The country became a socialist state, closely aligned with the Soviet Union, and remained so until the **Democratic Revolution** in 1990. Since then, Mongolia has transitioned to a **parliamentary democracy** and has been working to develop its economy and infrastructure.

The country's strategic location between Russia and China has made it an important player in regional politics, with both countries vying for influence. Mongolia has maintained a delicate balance between its two neighbors, while also seeking to develop its own economy and culture. The country has been a member of various international organizations, including the **United Nations**, since 1961.

Mongolia's history has been marked by periods of **nomadism**, with many Mongolians living a traditional lifestyle as herders and nomads.
