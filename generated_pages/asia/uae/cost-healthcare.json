  "content": "The cost of healthcare in UAE varies significantly between public and private facilities, with the average **health expenditure per capita** being around $2,402 per year, and healthcare costs can range from a few hundred to several thousand dollars for various medical services.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $2,402\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: varies by service and provider\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 999\nInsurance Required: Yes for certain nationalities and visa types\nCurrency: AED\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe UAE has a **mixed healthcare system**, with both public and private providers offering a range of medical services. Public healthcare is generally of high quality and is available to all UAE citizens and certain expatriates, while private healthcare is also widely available and often preferred by foreigners due to its high standards and English-speaking staff. The system works differently for locals and foreigners, with Emirati citizens typically having access to free or low-cost public healthcare, while expatriates often need to purchase private health insurance to cover their medical expenses. \n\nFor foreigners, having health insurance is often a requirement for obtaining a residence visa, and it is highly recommended to have a comprehensive insurance plan to cover unexpected medical expenses. The cost of healthcare in the UAE can be high, especially in private facilities, so it is essential to have adequate insurance coverage to avoid financial hardship. The UAE government has implemented various initiatives to improve the quality and accessibility of healthcare, including the introduction of mandatory health insurance for all residents in certain emirates.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $20-$50 | $100-$200 | varies by location and doctor's qualifications |\n| Specialist Consultation | $50-$100 | $200-$500 | depends on specialist and location |\n| Dental Checkup | $20-$50 | $50-$150 | includes basic examination and cleaning |\n| Eye Exam | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | includes basic eye test and consultation |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | prices vary depending on test type and location |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $200-$500 | depends on hospital and services required |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $500-$1,500 | varies by hospital and room type |\n| Basic Surgery | $2,000-$5,000 | depends on surgery type and hospital |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $2,000-$5,000 | includes hospital stay and basic care |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | prices vary depending on location and type of scan |\n| X-Ray | $20-$100 | depends on type of X-ray and location |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $50-$100 | basic medical services, including doctor visits and hospital stays |\n| Comprehensive Private | $200-$500 | wider range of medical services, including specialist consultations and surgeries |\n| International / Expat | $300-$1,000 | global coverage, including medical evacuation and repatriation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- **Prescription medication** prices vary widely, but a typical antibiotic course can cost between $10-$30\n- **Over-the-counter medications** are widely available and relatively affordable, with prices starting from $5-$10\n- **Pharmacy availability** is high, with many pharmacies open 24/7 in major cities\n- **Prescription rules** vary, but generally, a prescription from a licensed doctor is required for most medications\n- **Common medications** such as painkillers and antihistamines are widely available without a prescription\n- **Vaccinations** are generally affordable, with prices ranging from $20-$50 per dose\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the emergency number **999** or visit the nearest hospital.
