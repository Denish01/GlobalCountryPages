[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
The UAE's population has grown rapidly over the past few decades, driven by a combination of high birth rates and large-scale immigration. The country's population is projected to continue growing, albeit at a slower rate, due to declining fertility rates and increasing emigration. The UAE is one of the most urbanized countries in the world, with the majority of its population living in cities such as Dubai and Abu Dhabi. The country's population is also characterized by a high percentage of expatriates, with approximately 80% of the population consisting of non-citizens.

The UAE's population growth has been driven in part by its rapid economic development, which has created a large number of job opportunities in sectors such as construction, finance, and tourism. However, the country's population growth has also put pressure on its infrastructure and resources, particularly in areas such as housing, transportation, and healthcare. To address these challenges, the UAE government has implemented a range of policies aimed at managing population growth and promoting sustainable development.

The UAE's population is also characterized by a high level of mobility, with many people moving to the country for work or education. The country's location at the crossroads of Asia, Europe, and Africa makes it an attractive destination for people from a wide range of countries, and its relatively high standard of living and business-friendly environment have made it a popular choice for expatriates.
