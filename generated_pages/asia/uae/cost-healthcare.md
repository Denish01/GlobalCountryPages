[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
The UAE has a **mixed healthcare system**, with both public and private providers offering a range of medical services. Public healthcare is generally of high quality and is available to all UAE citizens and certain expatriates, while private healthcare is also widely available and often preferred by foreigners due to its high standards and English-speaking staff. The system works differently for locals and foreigners, with Emirati citizens typically having access to free or low-cost public healthcare, while expatriates often need to purchase private health insurance to cover their medical expenses. 

For foreigners, having health insurance is often a requirement for obtaining a residence visa, and it is highly recommended to have a comprehensive insurance plan to cover unexpected medical expenses. The cost of healthcare in the UAE can be high, especially in private facilities, so it is essential to have adequate insurance coverage to avoid financial hardship. The UAE government has implemented various initiatives to improve the quality and accessibility of healthcare, including the introduction of mandatory health insurance for all residents in certain emirates.
