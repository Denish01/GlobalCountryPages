[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
The UAE is well-connected to the rest of the world, with two major international airports, Dubai International Airport (DXB) and Abu Dhabi International Airport (AUH), offering direct flights to many destinations. Dubai International Airport is one of the busiest airports in the world and serves as a major hub for Emirates Airlines, while Abu Dhabi International Airport is a hub for Etihad Airways. Both airports offer a range of facilities and services, including duty-free shopping, restaurants, and lounges. Overland entry points are also available, with border crossings from neighboring countries such as Saudi Arabia and Oman.

In addition to the two main airports, there are several other international airports in the UAE, including Al Maktoum International Airport (DWC) in Dubai and Sharjah International Airport (SHJ) in Sharjah. These airports offer flights to a range of destinations, including Europe, Asia, and Africa. The UAE is also a popular stopover destination, with many travelers using the country's airports as a hub for onward travel to other parts of the world.

The UAE has an extensive domestic air network, with flights available between the country's seven emirates. The main domestic airlines are Emirates, Etihad Airways, and Air Arabia, which offer frequent flights between Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and other destinations such as Sharjah, Ras al-Khaimah, and Fujairah. Booking domestic flights is easy, with many airlines offering online booking systems and mobile apps. Approximate costs for domestic flights vary depending on the route and airline, but a one-way ticket can cost anywhere from $50 to $200. It's worth noting that domestic flights can be a convenient way to travel long distances, but may not always be the cheapest option.

The UAE has a limited rail network, with no high-speed trains currently in operation. However, there are plans to develop a national rail network in the future, which will connect the country's seven emirates and provide a convenient and efficient way to travel. Currently, the only rail service available is the Dubai Metro, which is a driverless, fully automated metro system that connects many parts of the city. The metro is a popular way to get around Dubai, with frequent trains and a range of ticket options available.

These companies offer bus services between the country's seven emirates, as well as to neighboring countries such as Oman and Saudi Arabia. The buses are generally comfortable and well-maintained, with air conditioning and other amenities.
