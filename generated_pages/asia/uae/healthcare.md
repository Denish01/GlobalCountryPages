The public sector is primarily funded by the government, while the private sector is driven by private investments and insurance companies. The quality of care in the UAE is considered to be excellent, with many hospitals and medical facilities equipped with state-of-the-art technology and staffed by highly qualified medical professionals. However, there is a significant difference in the quality of care between urban and rural areas, with urban areas generally having better access to medical facilities and services.

The public healthcare system in the UAE is generally free for citizens, but expatriates and visitors usually require private health insurance to access medical services. The private sector plays a significant role in the UAE's healthcare system, with many private hospitals and medical facilities offering a wide range of medical specialties and treatments. The UAE government has also introduced a mandatory health insurance scheme for all residents, which has helped to improve access to healthcare services for everyone.

The UAE has made significant investments in its healthcare infrastructure, with a focus on developing specialized medical facilities and services. This has helped to establish the country as a major hub for medical tourism in the region, with many patients traveling to the UAE for specialized treatments and surgeries. Overall, the UAE's healthcare system is well-organized and provides high-quality medical services to its residents and visitors.
