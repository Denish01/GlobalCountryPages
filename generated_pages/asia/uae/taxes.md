[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
The UAE has a **territorial tax system**, which means that only income earned within the country is subject to tax, and foreign-earned income is generally exempt. However, this applies to individuals who are considered **tax residents**, which typically includes those who have lived in the UAE for at least 183 days in a calendar year. The UAE also has a system of **free zones**, which are designated areas that offer tax exemptions and other incentives to businesses that operate within them.

The UAE's tax system is designed to be business-friendly, with a low-tax environment and a range of incentives for companies that set up operations in the country. The government has also introduced a range of measures to increase transparency and compliance with international tax standards, including the implementation of **automatic exchange of information** with other countries. This means that the UAE will share financial information about individuals and companies with other countries, in order to help prevent tax evasion and other forms of non-compliance.

[SECTION] Personal Income Tax [/SECTION]
Although the UAE does not impose a personal income tax on most residents, there are some exceptions, such as **withholding tax** on certain types of income, like dividends and interest.
