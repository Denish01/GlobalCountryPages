[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The UAE has a well-developed education system, with both public and private schools offering high-quality education. Public schools are generally free or subsidized for local students, but the quality of education can vary, and the language of instruction is Arabic. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a higher quality of education, with many following international curricula such as the British, American, or International Baccalaureate (IB) systems. Compulsory education in the UAE lasts for 12 years, from age 6 to 18, and students can attend either public or private schools. International schools are also widely available, catering to the large expat community in the UAE.

The quality of education in the UAE is generally high, with many schools offering state-of-the-art facilities and experienced teachers. However, the quality of public schools can vary, and some may not offer the same level of education as private schools. The language of instruction in public schools is Arabic, while private schools often teach in English or other languages. The UAE government has been working to improve the quality of education in public schools, with initiatives such as the introduction of new curricula and teacher training programs.
