The country is a **federation** of seven **emirates**, each with its own ruler, known as a **sheikh**.

The federal government is headed by a **president**, who is elected by the **Supreme Council of Rulers**, a body composed of the seven emirate rulers. The **separation of powers** is not strictly applied in the UAE, as the executive, legislative, and judicial branches are not entirely independent.

The UAE's political system is also marked by a **lack of democratic representation**, as there are no elected representatives at the federal level. However, the **Federal National Council**, a unicameral legislature, provides a platform for citizens to participate in the decision-making process. The council has 40 members, who are appointed by the **rulers of the emirates**. While the UAE's political system has been criticized for its **lack of transparency** and **accountability**, it has also been praised for its **stability** and **efficiency**.
