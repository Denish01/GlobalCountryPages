[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
The UAE has a **desert climate**, with very little rainfall throughout the year. The country can be divided into two main climate zones: the coastal region and the interior. The coastal region, where most of the population lives, has a more moderate climate, with average temperatures ranging from 24°C to 38°C (75°F to 100°F) throughout the year. The interior, on the other hand, is much hotter and drier, with temperatures often reaching 45°C (113°F) in the summer. The UAE does not have a distinct **wet season**, but it does experience a brief period of cooler weather from December to February, which is the best time to visit.

The **dry season**, which lasts from April to October, is characterized by extremely high temperatures and humidity, making outdoor activities challenging. However, this period is also the best time to enjoy the country's indoor attractions, such as shopping malls and museums. The **peak tourist season**, which coincides with the winter months, is the best time to enjoy outdoor activities like desert safaris, hiking, and water sports.

The UAE's climate and seasons have a significant impact on travel, with many tourists avoiding the country during the hot summer months. However, the cooler winter months attract a large number of visitors, making it the peak tourist season. The country's many **festivals and events**, such as the Dubai Shopping Festival and the Abu Dhabi Festival, also take place during this time, making it a great time to experience the country's culture and entertainment.
