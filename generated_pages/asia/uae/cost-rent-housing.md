[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in UAE is highly competitive, with a wide range of options available to suit different budgets and preferences. Typical lease terms in UAE are one to two years, with a security deposit equivalent to one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected under the UAE's laws, which require landlords to provide a written lease agreement and maintain the property in good condition. Compared to regional neighbors, UAE's housing costs are relatively high, with prices in cities like Dubai and Abu Dhabi surpassing those in Saudi Arabia and Oman.

The UAE's housing market is also characterized by a high demand for luxury properties, particularly in areas like Dubai Marina and Downtown Dubai. However, this has led to a shortage of affordable housing options, making it challenging for low- and middle-income residents to find suitable accommodation. To address this issue, the government has introduced initiatives to increase the supply of affordable housing, including the development of new residential areas and the implementation of rent control measures.
