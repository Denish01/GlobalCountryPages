Typical lease terms in UAE are one to two years, with a security deposit equivalent to one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected under the UAE's laws, which require landlords to provide a written lease agreement and maintain the property in good condition. Compared to regional neighbors, UAE's housing costs are relatively high, with prices in cities like Dubai and Abu Dhabi surpassing those in Saudi Arabia and Oman.\n\nThe UAE's housing market is also characterized by a high demand for luxury properties, particularly in areas like Dubai Marina and Downtown Dubai. However, this has led to a shortage of affordable housing options, making it challenging for low- and middle-income residents to find suitable accommodation. To address this issue, the government has introduced initiatives to increase the supply of affordable housing, including the development of new residential areas and the implementation of rent control measures.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $1,200 - 1,800 | $800 - 1,200 | Compact, basic amenities |\n| 1 Bedroom | $1,500 - 2,500 | $1,000 - 1,800 | Modern, mid-range amenities |\n| 2 Bedroom | $2,500 - 4,000 | $1,800 - 3,000 | Spacious, high-end amenities |\n| 3 Bedroom | $3,500 - 6,000 | $2,500 - 4,500 | Luxurious, premium amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $4,000 - 6,000 | Prime locations, luxury amenities |\n| Suburbs | $2,500 - 4,000 | Residential areas, mid-range amenities |\n| Rural | $1,500 - 2,500 | Limited amenities, natural surroundings |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- Downtown Dubai: $2,000 - 4,000 per month, modern, luxurious, and central\n- Dubai Marina: $1,800 - 3,500 per month, waterfront, vibrant, and cosmopolitan\n- Abu Dhabi Corniche: $1,500 - 3,000 per month, scenic, historic, and cultural\n- Palm Jumeirah: $2,500 - 5,000 per month, exclusive, luxurious, and beachfront\n- Al Barsha: $1,200 - 2,500 per month, family-friendly, residential, and affordable\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for UAE [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods thoroughly to find the best fit for your budget and lifestyle\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent to find a suitable property\n- Negotiate the rent and terms of the lease agreement before signing\n- Be aware of scams and frauds, and never pay a deposit without a signed lease agreement\n- Utilities such as water, electricity, and internet are usually not included in the rent\n- Furnished apartments are common, but unfurnished options are also available, especially for long-term leases\n- Consider the **traffic** and **commuting** time when choosing a neighborhood, as it can significantly impact your quality of life.",
