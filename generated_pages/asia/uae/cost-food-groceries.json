Compared to the regional average, UAE's food prices are relatively high due to its **import-dependent economy** and **high demand for luxury goods**. The country's **inflation rate** of 1.7% (2024) also contributes to the rising food costs. However, the UAE's **eating-out culture** is prevalent, and many residents prefer to dine out rather than cook at home, which has led to a proliferation of restaurants and cafes across the country. This demand has driven up prices, but it has also created a competitive market with a wide range of options to suit different budgets.\n\nThe cost of food in UAE can be influenced by various factors, including the type of cuisine, restaurant, and location. For example, **fast food** and **street food** are relatively affordable, while **fine dining** and **luxury restaurants** can be quite expensive. Additionally, the **quality and origin of ingredients** can also impact the final cost of a meal. In general, **local and traditional cuisine** tends to be more affordable than **international cuisine**, which often relies on imported ingredients. Furthermore, the **time of day** and **day of the week** can also affect prices, with **weekend brunches** and **peak hour meals** tend to be more expensive.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $1.50 | 5.50 AED | Full-fat or low-fat |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $1.20 | 4.40 AED | Freshly baked |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $2.50 | 9.20 AED | Large or extra-large |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $2.00 | 7.30 AED | Basmati or jasmine |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $6.00 | 22.00 AED | Boneless and skinless |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $12.00 | 44.00 AED | Grass-fed or grain-fed |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $4.00 | 14.70 AED | Imported from USA or Europe |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $2.50 | 9.20 AED | Fresh and locally grown |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $1.80 | 6.60 AED | Locally grown |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $1.50 | 5.50 AED | Locally grown |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $10.00 | 36.70 AED | Feta or akkawi |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $1.00 | 3.67 AED | Still or sparkling |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $5-10 | Typical dishes like shawarma or falafel |\n| Casual Restaurant | $15-30 | One person, including appetizer and main course |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $40-60 | 3 courses, including appetizer, main course, and dessert |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $100-150 | Upscale, including wine and fine service |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $8-12 | Available in most restaurants and bars |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $10-15 | Available in most restaurants and bars |\n| Cappuccino | $5-7 | Available in most cafes and restaurants |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $2-3 | Available in most restaurants and stores |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nWhen it comes to grocery shopping, UAE residents have the option to choose between **supermarkets** and **local markets**.

The prices of fresh produce, meats, and spices can vary significantly between the two, with local markets tend to be more affordable. However, the **quality and freshness** of the products may vary, and **bargaining** is often expected in local markets.\n\nIn general, it is recommended to buy **fresh produce**, **meats**, and **spices** from local markets, while **packaged goods** and **imported products** are often cheaper in supermarkets. Additionally, **local markets** are a great place to find **unique and traditional products**, such as **dates**, **honey**, and **local cheese**.
