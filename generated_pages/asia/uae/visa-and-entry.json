Citizens of these countries can stay in the UAE for up to 30 days without a visa, and can even extend their stay for an additional 30 days. However, citizens of other countries, including India, China, and many African nations, require a visa to enter the UAE. The UAE government has introduced an e-visa system, which allows citizens of eligible countries to apply for a visa online and receive it via email.\n\nThe UAE's visa policy is designed to attract tourists, business travelers, and investors, while also ensuring the security and safety of its citizens and residents. The government has introduced various types of visas, including tourist visas, business visas, and residence visas, each with its own set of requirements and restrictions. Visitors to the UAE can apply for a visa online, through the UAE government's official website, or through a registered travel agency.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | No | Visa-free | 30 days | Can extend for an additional 30 days |\n| UK Citizens | No | Visa-free | 30 days | Can extend for an additional 30 days |\n| EU Citizens | No | Visa-free | 30 days | Can extend for an additional 30 days |\n| Canadian Citizens | No | Visa-free | 30 days | Can extend for an additional 30 days |\n| Australian Citizens | No | Visa-free | 30 days | Can extend for an additional 30 days |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | eVisa | 30 days | Must apply online in advance |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | eVisa | 30 days | Must apply online in advance |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can apply for a visa on arrival or online, and can stay in the UAE for up to 30 days.
