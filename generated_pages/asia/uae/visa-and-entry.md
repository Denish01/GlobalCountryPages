# UAE Visa & Entry Requirements

To enter the UAE, citizens of certain countries require a visa, while others are eligible for visa-free access or can obtain a visa on arrival, depending on their nationality and the purpose of their visit.

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
The UAE has a moderate visa policy, with a total of 39 countries eligible for visa-free access, including citizens of the UK, US, Canada, Australia, and many European countries. Citizens of these countries can stay in the UAE for up to 30 days without a visa, and can even extend their stay for an additional 30 days. However, citizens of other countries, including India, China, and many African nations, require a visa to enter the UAE. The UAE government has introduced an e-visa system, which allows citizens of eligible countries to apply for a visa online and receive it via email.

The UAE's visa policy is designed to attract tourists, business travelers, and investors, while also ensuring the security and safety of its citizens and residents. The government has introduced various types of visas, including tourist visas, business visas, and residence visas, each with its own set of requirements and restrictions. Visitors to the UAE can apply for a visa online, through the UAE government's official website, or through a registered travel agency.

**Tourists:** Tourists can apply for a visa on arrival or online, and can stay in the UAE for up to 30 days. The typical stay for tourists is 7-10 days, and visitors can extend their stay for an additional 30 days. To apply for a tourist visa, visitors must provide proof of onward travel, hotel reservation, and sufficient funds.
**Business Travelers:** Business travelers require an invitation letter from a UAE-based company, and must apply for a business visa in advance. The requirements for business travelers differ from those for tourists, as they must provide proof of their business activities and may require additional documentation.
**Students:** Students require a student visa, which can be sponsored by their university or educational institution. Students must provide proof of enrollment, and their visa is typically valid for the duration of their studies.
**Workers:** Workers require a work visa, which can be sponsored by their employer. Workers must provide proof of their employment contract, and their visa is typically valid for up to 2 years.

The UAE has several main airports, including Dubai International Airport, Abu Dhabi International Airport, and Sharjah International Airport.

When arriving at an airport, visitors must proceed to the immigration counter, where they will be required to present their passport, visa (if required), and other documents. Visitors may be asked questions about their purpose of visit, accommodation, and onward travel plans. The immigration process typically takes around 30 minutes to an hour, depending on the time of arrival and the number of passengers.

The entry procedures for sea travelers are similar to those for air travelers, and visitors must present their passport, visa (if required), and other documents to the immigration authorities. The UAE government has introduced an automated immigration system, which allows visitors to clear immigration quickly and efficiently.
