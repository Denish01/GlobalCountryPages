[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has a well-developed transportation network, with a range of options available to get around, including public buses, metro systems, taxis, and ride-hailing services. The quality of public transit in the UAE is generally high, with modern and efficient systems in place, particularly in the major cities such as Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Most people in the UAE get around using private vehicles, but public transportation is also widely used, especially among commuters and tourists.

The UAE's transportation network is designed to cater to the country's large expatriate population and growing tourism industry, with many options available to suit different budgets and preferences. The country's roads are generally well-maintained, and traffic congestion is managed through a combination of traffic management systems and infrastructure development. However, traffic can still be a challenge during peak hours, especially in urban areas.
