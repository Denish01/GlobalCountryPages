# UAE Culture - Food, Traditions & Etiquette

The culture in UAE is a unique blend of traditional Islamic values and modern cosmopolitan influences, shaped by its strategic location at the crossroads of Asia, Europe, and Africa. 

[SECTION] Cultural Identity [/SECTION]
The UAE's cultural identity is defined by its rich Islamic heritage and Arab traditions, with a strong emphasis on hospitality, respect, and community. The country's key influences include its Islamic faith, Bedouin traditions, and its history as a trading hub, which has brought people from diverse backgrounds to its shores. The ethnic and linguistic makeup of the UAE is diverse, with Emiratis making up only about 20% of the population, while the remaining 80% consists of expatriates from countries such as India, Pakistan, and the Philippines, who have come to work and live in the country. Arabic is the official language, but English, Hindi, and Urdu are also widely spoken.

The UAE's cultural identity is also reflected in its architecture, with grand mosques, traditional souks, and modern skyscrapers standing side by side. The country's cultural scene is further enriched by its many museums, cultural centers, and festivals, which showcase its history, art, and traditions. Despite its modernization and urbanization, the UAE remains deeply rooted in its Islamic values and Arab customs, with a strong sense of community and social cohesion.

The UAE's cultural diversity is also evident in its many different nationalities and ethnic groups, each with their own unique customs and traditions. This diversity has created a vibrant and dynamic cultural scene, with a wide range of cultural events, festivals, and activities taking place throughout the year. From traditional Arabic music and dance to modern art exhibitions and international film festivals, the UAE has something to offer for every interest and taste.
