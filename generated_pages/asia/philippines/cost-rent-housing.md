[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Philippines is relatively affordable, with a wide range of options available for expats and locals alike. Typical lease terms are 6-12 months, with a one- or two-month deposit required. Tenant rights are protected by law, but it's essential to carefully review the lease agreement before signing. Compared to its regional neighbors, Philippines's housing costs are relatively low, making it an attractive destination for expats and foreign investors. The country's housing market is also driven by a growing middle class, with many Filipinos seeking to own their own homes.

The Philippines's housing market is also influenced by its growing economy, with a GDP per capita of $11,794, and a relatively low inflation rate of 3.2%. The government has also implemented policies to increase access to affordable housing, including subsidies for low-income families and incentives for developers to build affordable housing units. However, the country still faces challenges in providing adequate housing for its large and growing population, with many Filipinos living in informal settlements or facing housing shortages in urban areas.
