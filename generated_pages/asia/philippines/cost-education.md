[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The Philippines has a well-established education system, with both public and private schools offering a range of programs from primary to tertiary levels. Public schools are generally free or subsidized, but the quality of education can vary significantly depending on the location and resources available. Private schools, on the other hand, tend to offer higher-quality education, but at a higher cost. The language of instruction is primarily Filipino and English, with English being the primary language used in most schools. Compulsory education in the Philippines lasts for 12 years, from primary to secondary levels. International schools are also available, particularly in major cities like Manila and Cebu, offering a range of curricula such as the International Baccalaureate (IB) and the Cambridge International Examinations (CIE).

The quality of education in the Philippines is generally considered to be good, with many schools offering a range of extracurricular activities and programs to support student development. However, there are some concerns about the quality of education in public schools, particularly in rural areas where resources may be limited. Private schools, on the other hand, tend to have more resources and better facilities, but can be expensive. International schools offer a high-quality education, but are generally the most expensive option. Overall, the Philippines offers a range of educational options to suit different needs and budgets.
