  "content": "The education system in the Philippines is a formal and structured system that consists of primary, secondary, and tertiary levels, with a strong emphasis on English as the primary language of instruction, offering various opportunities for both local and international students to study in the country.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nLiteracy Rate: 95.6%\nSchool System: 12 years of compulsory education\nLanguage of Instruction: Filipino and English\nAcademic Calendar: June to March\nInternational Schools: available\nTop University Ranking: ranked among the top 1000 universities globally\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe education system in the Philippines is divided into three main levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary. The primary level, also known as elementary education, lasts for six years and is compulsory for all children aged six to twelve. The secondary level, also known as high school, lasts for four years and is also compulsory for all children aged thirteen to seventeen. The tertiary level, also known as college or university, is not compulsory but is highly encouraged for those who want to pursue higher education. The quality of education in the Philippines is generally good, with a strong emphasis on English as the primary language of instruction. However, there are some challenges, particularly in the public education system, where resources and facilities can be limited. Private schools, on the other hand, offer higher quality education but are often expensive and inaccessible to many.\n\nThe education system in the Philippines is overseen by the Department of Education (DepEd) for basic education and the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) for tertiary education. The DepEd is responsible for setting the curriculum and standards for primary and secondary education, while the CHED is responsible for setting the standards and accreditation for tertiary education. The government has implemented various reforms in recent years to improve the quality of education, including the introduction of the K-12 program, which adds two years to the basic education cycle.\n\nThe public and private education systems in the Philippines have their own strengths and weaknesses. The public education system is free and accessible to all, but it often suffers from limited resources and facilities. The private education system, on the other hand, offers higher quality education but is often expensive and inaccessible to many. Despite these challenges, the education system in the Philippines has produced many successful and highly educated individuals who have made significant contributions to the country and the world.\n\n[SECTION] Top Universities [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| University | Location | Known For | Est.
