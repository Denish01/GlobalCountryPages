[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The Philippines has made significant strides in improving its internet infrastructure over the years, with the average internet speed increasing to 7.4 Mbps. However, the country still faces an urban-rural divide in terms of internet quality, with faster speeds and more reliable connections available in major cities like Manila and Cebu, while rural areas often experience slower speeds and more frequent outages. Despite these challenges, the internet is generally reliable, with most users experiencing minimal downtime and few issues with connectivity.

The Philippine government has implemented initiatives to improve internet access and speed, particularly in rural areas, with the goal of increasing digital inclusion and promoting economic growth. As a result, internet penetration has increased, with more Filipinos having access to the internet and using it for various purposes, including communication, education, and entertainment. However, the country still lags behind its neighbors in terms of internet speed and quality, and there is room for improvement to meet the growing demands of its digital economy.
