[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
The Philippines has the 13th largest population in the world, with a significant youth population and a growing urban population. The country's population growth rate is relatively high, with an average annual growth rate of 1.6%. This growth is driven by a combination of factors, including a high fertility rate and a relatively young population. The urban population is also growing rapidly, with many Filipinos moving to cities in search of better economic opportunities. The Philippines is also a major source of international migrants, with many Filipinos working abroad in countries such as the United States, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.

The population of the Philippines is projected to continue growing, with estimates suggesting that it will reach 142 million by 2030. This growth will pose significant challenges for the country, including providing adequate housing, healthcare, and education for its growing population. The government has implemented various policies to address these challenges, including family planning programs and initiatives to improve access to education and healthcare.

The Philippines is also experiencing a significant shift in its population structure, with a growing proportion of older Filipinos. This shift is driven by a combination of factors, including declining fertility rates and improving healthcare. The proportion of Filipinos aged 65 and over is expected to increase significantly in the coming years, posing challenges for the country's pension and healthcare systems.
