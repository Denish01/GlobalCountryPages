[SECTION] How Philippines Is Divided [/SECTION]
The Philippines is an archipelago divided into 18 regions, which are further subdivided into 81 provinces. These provinces are then divided into cities and municipalities. The country's administrative structure is designed to promote decentralization and give more autonomy to local governments. The 18 regions are grouped into three main geographical divisions: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. Each region has its own unique culture, economy, and geography, which are shaped by the country's history, climate, and natural resources.

The regional divisions are based on a combination of geographical, cultural, and economic factors. For example, the National Capital Region (NCR) is a special administrative region that includes the capital city of Manila and its surrounding cities. Other regions, such as the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR) and the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), have been established to recognize the unique cultural and historical identities of certain areas. Understanding the regional divisions is essential to navigating the country and appreciating its diverse culture and geography.
