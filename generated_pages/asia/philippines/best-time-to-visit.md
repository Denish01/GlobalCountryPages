[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
The Philippines is an archipelago with a tropical climate, characterized by two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from December to May, is the best time to visit the Philippines, with low humidity and plenty of sunshine. The wet season, which runs from June to November, is marked by heavy rainfall and potential storms, making it less ideal for outdoor activities. The country is divided into four climate zones, including tropical rainforest, tropical savanna, tropical monsoon, and humid subtropical, each with its own unique weather patterns. Understanding the seasons and climate zones is essential for planning a trip to the Philippines, as it can greatly affect the quality of your travel experience.

The dry season is the peak tourist season in the Philippines, with many visitors flocking to the country's beaches, islands, and tourist attractions. The weather is usually calm and sunny, making it perfect for swimming, snorkeling, and other water activities. However, the dry season is also the busiest and most expensive time to visit, with higher prices for accommodations and tourist services. In contrast, the wet season is the low season, with fewer tourists and lower prices, but it can also be a challenging time to travel, with potential storms and flooding.

The Philippines is also prone to natural disasters, including typhoons, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions, which can occur at any time of the year. Visitors should be aware of the potential risks and take necessary precautions, such as checking the weather forecast and following local news and advisories.
