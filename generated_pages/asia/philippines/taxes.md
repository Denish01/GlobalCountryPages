[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
The Philippines has a territorial tax system, where income earned within the country is subject to tax, regardless of the taxpayer's residence. However, Philippine citizens and residents are also subject to tax on their worldwide income, with certain exemptions and deductions available. To be considered a tax resident in the Philippines, an individual must have been present in the country for more than 180 days in a calendar year, or have a permanent home in the country.

The tax system in the Philippines is administered by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), which is responsible for collecting taxes, enforcing tax laws, and providing taxpayer services. The BIR also provides guidance and support to taxpayers through its website, tax offices, and call centers. Taxpayers can also seek assistance from tax professionals, such as certified public accountants (CPAs) and tax lawyers, to help them navigate the tax system and ensure compliance with tax laws and regulations.
