These provinces are then divided into cities and municipalities. The country's administrative structure is designed to promote decentralization and give more autonomy to local governments. The 18 regions are grouped into three main geographical divisions: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. Each region has its own unique culture, economy, and geography, which are shaped by the country's history, climate, and natural resources.\n\nThe regional divisions are based on a combination of geographical, cultural, and economic factors. For example, the National Capital Region (NCR) is a special administrative region that includes the capital city of Manila and its surrounding cities. Other regions, such as the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR) and the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), have been established to recognize the unique cultural and historical identities of certain areas. Understanding the regional divisions is essential to navigating the country and appreciating its diverse culture and geography.\n\n[SECTION] Major Cities [/SECTION]\n**Manila** (1.8M)\nRole: capital, economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: its rich history, vibrant nightlife, and world-class shopping malls\nBest For: history buffs, foodies, and shoppers\n\n**Quezon City** (2.9M)\nRole: former capital, economic hub, educational center\nKnown For: its universities, hospitals, and entertainment venues\nBest For: students, professionals, and families\n\n**Cebu City** (922,000)\nRole: economic hub, cultural center, port city\nKnown For: its historic landmarks, beautiful beaches, and vibrant festivals\nBest For: tourists, entrepreneurs, and adventurers\n\n**Davao City** (1.6M)\nRole: economic hub, agricultural center, tourist destination\nKnown For: its scenic beauty, exotic wildlife, and durian fruit\nBest For: nature lovers, foodies, and travelers\n\n**Caloocan** (1.5M)\nRole: industrial center, residential area, commercial hub\nKnown For: its manufacturing industries, shopping malls, and historic landmarks\nBest For: workers, shoppers, and families\n\n**Zamboanga City** (861,000)\nRole: port city, economic hub, cultural center\nKnown For: its historic landmarks, beautiful beaches, and vibrant festivals\nBest For: tourists, entrepreneurs, and travelers\n\n**Baguio** (345,000)\nRole: tourist destination, educational center, cultural hub\nKnown For: its cool climate, scenic beauty, and vibrant arts scene\nBest For: tourists, students, and artists\n\n**Iloilo City** (447,000)\nRole: economic hub, cultural center, tourist destination\nKnown For: its historic landmarks, beautiful beaches, and vibrant festivals\nBest For: tourists, entrepreneurs, and travelers\n\n[SECTION] Key Regions [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Region | Character | Known For | Major City |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| National Capital Region | urban, cosmopolitan | business, entertainment, culture | Manila |\n| Cordillera Administrative Region | mountainous, scenic | natural beauty, indigenous culture | Baguio |\n| Ilocos Region | coastal, historic | beaches, landmarks, festivals | Vigan |\n| Central Luzon | agricultural, industrial | farming, manufacturing, tourism | Angeles |\n| Southern Tagalog | urban, industrial | business, entertainment, culture | Calamba |\n| Central Visayas | coastal, scenic | beaches, islands, festivals | Cebu City |\n| Eastern Visayas | coastal, natural | scenic beauty, outdoor activities | Tacloban |\n| Northern Mindanao | agricultural, industrial | farming, manufacturing, tourism | Cagayan de Oro |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Regional Differences [/SECTION]\n- The northern regions, such as Ilocos and Cordillera, have a cooler climate and are known for their natural beauty and indigenous culture.\n- The central regions, such as Central Luzon and Southern Tagalog, are urbanized and industrialized, with a strong focus on business and entertainment.\n- The southern regions, such as Central Visayas and Northern Mindanao, are coastal and scenic, with a strong focus on tourism and agriculture.\n- The eastern regions, such as Eastern Visayas, are prone to natural disasters, such as typhoons and earthquakes, and have a distinct cultural identity shaped by their history and geography.\n\n[SECTION] Getting Around [/SECTION]\nThe Philippines has a well-developed transportation network, with domestic flights, buses, and trains connecting major cities and towns.
