Public schools are generally free or subsidized, but the quality of education can vary significantly depending on the location and resources available. Private schools, on the other hand, tend to offer higher-quality education, but at a higher cost. The language of instruction is primarily Filipino and English, with English being the primary language used in most schools. Compulsory education in the Philippines lasts for 12 years, from primary to secondary levels. International schools are also available, particularly in major cities like Manila and Cebu, offering a range of curricula such as the International Baccalaureate (IB) and the Cambridge International Examinations (CIE).\n\nThe quality of education in the Philippines is generally considered to be good, with many schools offering a range of extracurricular activities and programs to support student development. However, there are some concerns about the quality of education in public schools, particularly in rural areas where resources may be limited. Private schools, on the other hand, tend to have more resources and better facilities, but can be expensive. International schools offer a high-quality education, but are generally the most expensive option. Overall, the Philippines offers a range of educational options to suit different needs and budgets.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0-$100 | Free or subsidized, varying quality |\n| Private Primary | $1,000-$5,000 | Range by tier, from basic to premium |\n| Public Secondary | $0-$200 | Free or subsidized, varying quality |\n| Private Secondary | $2,000-$10,000 | Range by tier, from basic to premium |\n| International School | $5,000-$20,000 | Curriculum types include IB, CIE, and US-based programs |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $500-$2,000 | $1,000-$5,000 | Limited slots for international students |\n| Private University | $2,000-$10,000 | $5,000-$20,000 | Range by tier, from basic to premium |\n| Top-Ranked University | $5,000-$15,000 | $10,000-$30,000 | University of the Philippines, Ateneo de Manila University |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $50-$200 | Varying quality and services |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $10-$50 | Range by subject and tutor qualification |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $100-$500 | English, Filipino, or other languages |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $50-$200 | Basic to premium quality |\n| School Uniform | $20-$100 | Required for most schools |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The **International School of Manila** and **British School Manila** are popular choices for expats, offering high-quality education and international curricula.\n- Scholarship opportunities are available for local and international students, particularly for those pursuing higher education in public universities.\n- Online learning options are becoming increasingly popular, with many schools and universities offering online courses and programs.\n- Education quality in the Philippines is generally considered to be good, but can vary depending on the institution and location.\n- **English language proficiency** is highly valued in the Philippines, and many schools offer English language programs and courses.\n- The Philippines is a popular destination for international students, with many universities offering affordable tuition fees and a range of academic programs.",
