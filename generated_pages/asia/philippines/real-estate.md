[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]
The Philippine property market has been growing steadily over the past decade, driven by a combination of factors including a rapidly expanding economy, a growing middle class, and a large and young population. The market has been particularly strong in urban areas such as Manila, Cebu, and Davao, where demand for residential and commercial space has been driven by the growth of the business process outsourcing (BPO) industry and other sectors. In recent years, the market has also seen an increase in demand for **luxury properties**, particularly in areas such as Makati and Bonifacio Global City, which are popular with expatriates and high-net-worth individuals.

The current market conditions are characterized by a **supply shortage**, particularly in the residential sector, which has driven up prices in recent years. However, the market is expected to continue growing, driven by the country's strong economic fundamentals and the ongoing **urbanization trend**. The Philippine government has also implemented various initiatives to support the property market, including the development of new infrastructure projects and the relaxation of certain **foreign ownership rules**.

In terms of price trajectory, the Philippine property market has seen significant growth in recent years, with prices increasing by as much as 10% per annum in some areas. However, the market is expected to slow down in the coming years, as the government implements measures to cool down the market and prevent a **property bubble**. Despite this, the market is still expected to remain strong, driven by the country's underlying economic fundamentals and the ongoing demand for property.
