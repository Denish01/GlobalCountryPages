[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Vietnam is classified as a lower-middle-income economy, with a GDP growth rate averaging around 6-7% over the past decade. The country has made significant progress in reducing poverty and improving living standards, with the poverty rate declining from over 50% in the 1990s to less than 5% today. Vietnam's economic development has been driven by a combination of factors, including large-scale economic reforms, foreign investment, and a highly competitive labor market. The government has implemented policies to promote economic growth, improve the business environment, and increase foreign investment, with a focus on developing the country's infrastructure, human capital, and technology sectors.

Vietnam's economy is also characterized by a high level of trade openness, with exports accounting for over 100% of GDP. The country has signed several free trade agreements, including the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA), which have helped to increase trade and investment with other countries. However, the economy is also vulnerable to external shocks, including fluctuations in global commodity prices and changes in trade policies.

The government has set a target to become an upper-middle-income country by 2035, with a GDP per capita of at least $7,000. To achieve this goal, Vietnam will need to continue to promote economic growth, improve the business environment, and increase investment in human capital and technology. The government has also identified several key sectors, including manufacturing, services, and tourism, as priority areas for development.
