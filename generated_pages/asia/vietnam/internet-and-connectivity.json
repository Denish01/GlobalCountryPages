The country's urban areas, such as Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, tend to have faster and more reliable internet connections compared to rural areas, where speeds can be slower and less consistent. However, overall, the internet quality in Vietnam is generally good, with most users able to access high-speed connections. The Vietnamese government has also invested heavily in expanding the country's fiber-optic network, which has helped to improve the reliability and speed of internet connections across the country.\n\nDespite these improvements, there is still a noticeable urban-rural divide when it comes to internet access in Vietnam. While cities like Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City have widespread coverage and fast speeds, rural areas often have slower speeds and less reliable connections. However, this is changing rapidly, with many rural areas now having access to 4G and even 5G networks. Additionally, the Vietnamese government has implemented initiatives to improve internet access in rural areas, such as providing subsidies for internet service providers to expand their networks.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nGetting a SIM card in Vietnam is a straightforward process, with many options available for tourists and travelers. You can buy a SIM card at most airports, as well as at mobile phone shops and convenience stores across the country. To purchase a SIM card, you will typically need to provide your passport and fill out a registration form. The cost of a tourist SIM card is around 5 USD, and data plans are generally affordable, with prices starting from around 1 USD per day for 1 GB of data. The top three mobile carriers in Vietnam - Viettel, Vinaphone, and Mobifone - all offer a range of tourist-friendly plans, including data-only and voice-and-data plans.\n\nIt's recommended to purchase a SIM card from one of the major carriers, as they tend to have the best coverage and fastest speeds. You can also purchase a SIM card online before you arrive in Vietnam, which can be a convenient option if you want to have a working phone as soon as you arrive. Additionally, many airports have SIM card vending machines, which can be a quick and easy way to get a SIM card.\n\n[TABLE]\n| Carrier | Tourist Plan | Data | Price (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Viettel | Tourist SIM | 1 GB | 1 USD/day | Includes free calls and texts to Viettel numbers |\n| Vinaphone | Prepaid SIM | 3 GB | 5 USD/week | Includes free calls and texts to Vinaphone numbers |\n| Mobifone | Data SIM | 10 GB | 10 USD/month | Includes free calls and texts to Mobifone numbers |\n| Vietnam Mobile | Tourist Plan | 5 GB | 10 USD/week | Includes free calls and texts to Vietnam Mobile numbers |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] WiFi Availability [/SECTION]\n- Hotel WiFi quality in Vietnam is generally good, with most hotels and resorts offering free WiFi to their guests.\n- Cafe WiFi culture is also widespread in Vietnam, with many cafes and coffee shops offering free WiFi to customers.\n- Coworking spaces are becoming increasingly popular in Vietnam, particularly in cities like Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, and often offer high-speed WiFi and other amenities.\n- Public WiFi is also available in many areas, including airports, train stations, and public parks.\n- Many restaurants and bars also offer free WiFi, making it easy to stay connected while you're out and about.\n\n[SECTION] For Remote Workers [/SECTION]\n- Coworking spaces are a great option for remote workers, offering high-speed WiFi, comfortable workspaces, and other amenities like meeting rooms and networking events.\n- Reliable cafe chains like Highlands Coffee and Trung Nguyen Legend Cafe offer good WiFi and a comfortable working environment.\n- Backup internet options like portable WiFi hotspots and mobile SIM cards can be useful in case of an emergency or if you need to work from a remote location.\n- VPNs can be useful for remote workers who need to access sensitive information or work with clients in other countries.\n- Online communities and networking groups can be a great way to connect with other remote workers and digital nomads in Vietnam.\n\n[SECTION] Tips & Warnings [/SECTION]\n- Internet censorship is a concern in Vietnam, with some websites and social media platforms blocked or restricted.\n- Blocked sites include Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, although these can often be accessed using a VPN.\n- VPN recommendations include ExpressVPN and NordVPN, which offer reliable and secure connections.\n- Roaming alternatives like portable WiFi hotspots and local SIM cards can be a more cost-effective option than roaming with your home carrier.\n- eSIM options are also available, although they may not be supported by all devices or carriers.\n- Be aware of your data usage and avoid using public WiFi for sensitive activities like online banking or shopping.",
