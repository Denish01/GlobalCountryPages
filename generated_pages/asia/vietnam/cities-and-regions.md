[SECTION] How Vietnam Is Divided [/SECTION]
Vietnam is divided into 58 provinces and five municipalities, which are further divided into districts, towns, and villages. The country's administrative structure is hierarchical, with the central government in Hanoi overseeing the provinces and municipalities, which in turn govern the local districts and towns. This structure allows for a balance of power between the central government and local authorities, enabling Vietnam to effectively manage its diverse regions and populations.

The provinces and municipalities are grouped into eight regions, each with its own distinct character and economic profile. These regions are: the Northwest, Northeast, Red River Delta, North Central Coast, South Central Coast, Central Highlands, Southeast, and Mekong Delta. Each region has its own unique cultural, economic, and geographical features, which are reflected in the local way of life, cuisine, and attractions.
