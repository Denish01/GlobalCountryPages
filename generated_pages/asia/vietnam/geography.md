[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Vietnam is situated in Southeast Asia, on the eastern part of the Indochinese Peninsula, with a long coastline along the South China Sea to the east. The country shares its borders with three countries: China to the north, Laos to the northwest, and Cambodia to the southwest. The Gulf of Tonkin lies to the northeast, while the Gulf of Thailand is located to the southwest. Vietnam's strategic location has made it an important trade and cultural hub in the region.

The country's geography is also characterized by its proximity to several major bodies of water, including the South China Sea, the Gulf of Tonkin, and the Gulf of Thailand. The Mekong River, one of the longest rivers in Asia, flows through Vietnam and plays a crucial role in the country's agriculture and economy. The country's location has also made it vulnerable to natural disasters, such as typhoons and floods, which can have a significant impact on its population and economy.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Vietnam's terrain is diverse and complex, featuring a range of landscapes, from mountains and hills to plains and coastlines. The country can be divided into three main regions: the northern mountains, the central region, and the southern plains. The northern mountains are home to some of the highest peaks in Vietnam, including Fan Si Pan, the country's highest point. The central region is characterized by a narrow coastal plain, with several major cities, including Da Nang and Hue. The southern plains are dominated by the Mekong Delta, a vast network of rivers, canals, and wetlands that support a wide range of agricultural activities.

The country's mountains and hills are covered with dense forests, which are home to a wide range of flora and fauna. The forests are also an important source of timber and other forest products, which contribute significantly to the country's economy. Vietnam's coastlines are also an important feature of its geography, with several major ports, including Haiphong and Ho Chi Minh City. The coastlines are also home to several popular tourist destinations, including Nha Trang and Da Nang.

Vietnam's rivers and lakes are also an important part of its geography, with several major rivers, including the Mekong, Red, and Perfume rivers. The rivers support a wide range of aquatic life and are an important source of fish and other seafood. The lakes, including Hoan Kiem Lake in Hanoi and West Lake in Hanoi, are popular tourist destinations and offer a range of recreational activities, including boating and fishing.
