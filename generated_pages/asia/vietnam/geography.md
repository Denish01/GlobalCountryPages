[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Vietnam is situated in Southeast Asia, on the eastern edge of the Indochinese Peninsula, with a long coastline along the South China Sea. The country shares borders with three countries: China to the north, Laos to the northwest, and Cambodia to the southwest. The Gulf of Tonkin lies to the northeast, while the Gulf of Thailand is located to the southwest. Vietnam's strategic location has made it an important trade and cultural hub in the region, with many major cities and ports situated along its coastlines.

The country's borders have been shaped by its complex history, with various dynasties and empires vying for control over the region. Today, Vietnam's borders are generally recognized by the international community, although there are still some disputes with neighboring countries over territorial claims. The country's geography has also played a significant role in shaping its culture and economy, with the fertile Mekong Delta region being a major agricultural hub and the mountainous north being home to many ethnic minority groups.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Vietnam's terrain is characterized by a mix of mountains, hills, and coastal plains. The northern part of the country is home to the **Hoang Lien Son** mountain range, which includes the highest peak, **Fansipan**, also known as the "Roof of Indochina". The central region is marked by a series of rugged hills and mountains, while the south is generally flatter, with the **Mekong Delta** region being a vast network of rivers, canals, and wetlands. The country's coastline is over 3,400 kilometers long, with many beautiful beaches, bays, and islands, including the popular tourist destination of **Ha Long Bay**.

The country's landscape is also dotted with numerous rivers, including the **Red River**, which flows through the capital city of Hanoi, and the **Mekong River**, which forms the border with Cambodia. The **Central Highlands** region is home to many scenic lakes, waterfalls, and national parks, including the **Ba Be National Park** and the **Cat Tien National Park**. Vietnam's diverse geography has created a wide range of ecosystems, from tropical rainforests to coral reefs, and supports a rich biodiversity of flora and fauna.

The country's terrain has also played a significant role in shaping its history and culture, with many important battles and events taking place in the mountainous regions. The **Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)**, which separated North and South Vietnam during the Vietnam War, runs along the 17th parallel and is now a popular tourist destination. The **Ho Chi Minh Trail**, a network of paths and roads used by the North Vietnamese Army during the war, is also located in the central region.
