[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Vietnam is a long, thin country with a diverse range of climates, from the **tropical** south to the **temperate** north. The country can be divided into three main climate zones: the north, the central region, and the south. The north has a **cold winter** from December to February, with average temperatures ranging from 10 to 15°C (50 to 59°F), while the south has a **hot and humid** climate year-round, with average temperatures ranging from 20 to 30°C (68 to 86°F). The central region has a **mix of both**, with a hot and dry summer from June to August and a cool and wet winter from December to February.

The **dry season**, which typically runs from October to April, is the best time to visit Vietnam, as the weather is generally dry and sunny, with minimal risk of rain. The **wet season**, which runs from May to September, can be challenging for travelers, as the rain can be heavy and frequent, causing flooding and landslides in some areas. However, the wet season also brings a lush and green landscape, making it a great time for **nature lovers** and **photographers**.

The seasons in Vietnam can have a significant impact on travel plans, as some areas may be closed due to weather conditions, and others may be crowded with tourists. For example, the **Ha Long Bay** area in the north is best visited during the dry season, as the rain can make the sea rough and reduce visibility. On the other hand, the **Mekong Delta** in the south is best visited during the wet season, as the rain brings a lush and green landscape, and the rivers are at their peak.
