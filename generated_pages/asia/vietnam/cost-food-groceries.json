The country's **agricultural sector** plays a significant role in keeping food prices down, with Vietnam being one of the world's largest exporters of rice, coffee, and other commodities. However, prices can fluctuate depending on the location, with major cities like Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City tend to be more expensive than rural areas. The eating-out culture is also prevalent in Vietnam, with many locals opting for street food or local eateries, which are often cheaper and more convenient than cooking at home.\n\nThe cost of food in Vietnam can be driven up by factors such as **inflation**, which stood at 3.6% in 2024, and **import costs**, which can make certain products like meat and dairy more expensive. However, the country's **subsidies** on essential goods like rice and cooking oil help keep prices in check. Overall, Vietnam offers a great balance of affordability and variety when it comes to food, making it an excellent destination for foodies and budget travelers.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $1.50 | 35,000 VND | |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $1.20 | 28,000 VND | |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $1.00 | 23,000 VND | |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $0.50 | 12,000 VND | |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $3.50 | 80,000 VND | |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $6.00 | 140,000 VND | |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $2.00 | 45,000 VND | |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $1.00 | 23,000 VND | |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $0.80 | 18,000 VND | |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $0.60 | 14,000 VND | |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $5.00 | 115,000 VND | |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $0.50 | 12,000 VND | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $2-5 | (typical dishes like pho, banh mi) |\n| Casual Restaurant | $5-10 | (one person, 2-3 courses) |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $15-30 | (3 courses, moderate wine) |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $30-50 | (upscale, extensive wine list) |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $1-2 | |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $2-3 | |\n| Cappuccino | $2-3 | |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $1-2 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nWhen it comes to shopping for groceries, Vietnam offers a mix of supermarkets and local markets, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.
