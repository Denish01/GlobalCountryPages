[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Vietnam is divided into public and private sectors, with public schools generally offering free or subsidized education to Vietnamese citizens. However, the quality of education can vary significantly between public and private schools, with private schools often having better facilities and more experienced teachers. The language of instruction in Vietnamese schools is primarily Vietnamese, although some private and international schools may offer instruction in English or other languages. Compulsory education in Vietnam lasts for 12 years, from the age of 6 to 18, and is divided into primary, secondary, and high school levels. International schools are also available in major cities such as Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, offering a range of curricula including the International Baccalaureate and the Cambridge International Examinations.

The quality of education in Vietnam has improved significantly in recent years, with the country making significant strides in increasing access to education and improving educational outcomes. However, there are still challenges to be addressed, including a shortage of qualified teachers and inadequate infrastructure in some areas. Despite these challenges, Vietnam has a highly educated population, with a literacy rate of over 95%, and a strong emphasis on education as a key driver of economic development. The government has also implemented a range of initiatives to improve the quality of education, including the introduction of new curricula and teaching methods, and the development of vocational training programs to help students acquire practical skills.
