However, the quality of education can vary significantly between public and private schools, with private schools often having better facilities and more experienced teachers. The language of instruction in Vietnamese schools is primarily Vietnamese, although some private and international schools may offer instruction in English or other languages. Compulsory education in Vietnam lasts for 12 years, from the age of 6 to 18, and is divided into primary, secondary, and high school levels. International schools are also available in major cities such as Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, offering a range of curricula including the International Baccalaureate and the Cambridge International Examinations.\n\nThe quality of education in Vietnam has improved significantly in recent years, with the country making significant strides in increasing access to education and improving educational outcomes. However, there are still challenges to be addressed, including a shortage of qualified teachers and inadequate infrastructure in some areas. Despite these challenges, Vietnam has a highly educated population, with a literacy rate of over 95%, and a strong emphasis on education as a key driver of economic development. The government has also implemented a range of initiatives to improve the quality of education, including the introduction of new curricula and teaching methods, and the development of vocational training programs to help students acquire practical skills.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 (free) | Quality can vary, but generally good |\n| Private Primary | $200-$1,000 | Range varies by tier and location |\n| Public Secondary | $0 (free) | Quality can vary, but generally good |\n| Private Secondary | $500-$2,500 | Range varies by tier and location |\n| International School | $2,000-$10,000 | Curriculum types include IB, Cambridge, and US |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $100-$500 | $1,000-$2,000 | Limited spots available for international students |\n| Private University | $1,000-$3,000 | $2,000-$5,000 | Range varies by institution and program |\n| Top-Ranked University | $2,000-$5,000 | $3,000-$6,000 | Examples include Vietnam National University and University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $50-$200 | Range varies by location and quality |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $10-$50 | Range varies by subject and tutor experience |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $50-$200 | Range varies by language and level |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $20-$100 | Range varies by level and quality |\n| School Uniform | $10-$50 | Range varies by school and quality |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The best schools for expats in Vietnam are often international schools, which offer a range of curricula and have experienced teachers.\n- Scholarship availability is limited, but some universities and organizations offer scholarships to international students.\n- Online learning options are becoming increasingly popular in Vietnam, with many universities and institutions offering online courses and degree programs.\n- Education quality in Vietnam is generally good, but can vary depending on the institution and location.\n- The cost of living in Vietnam is relatively low, making it an attractive destination for international students.\n- It is recommended to research and visit schools before making a decision, as the quality and cost of education can vary significantly.",
