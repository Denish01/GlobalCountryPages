[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Vietnam operates a **territorial taxation** system, where tax is levied on income derived from sources within Vietnam, regardless of the taxpayer's residency status. However, residents are also subject to tax on their worldwide income, with credits available for taxes paid overseas. Residency for tax purposes is determined by the number of days spent in Vietnam, with individuals who stay for 183 days or more in a calendar year considered tax residents.

The tax system in Vietnam is overseen by the General Department of Taxation, which is responsible for collecting taxes, enforcing tax laws, and providing guidance to taxpayers. The tax year in Vietnam runs from January to December, and taxpayers are required to file their tax returns by the end of May of the following year. Vietnam has a well-established tax treaty network, with agreements in place to prevent double taxation and fiscal evasion with over 80 countries.
