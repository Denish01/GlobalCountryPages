[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Vietnam has several international airports, with the main ones being Noi Bai International Airport in Hanoi and Tan Son Nhat International Airport in Ho Chi Minh City. These airports receive direct flights from major hubs in Asia, Europe, and North America, including Singapore, Bangkok, Seoul, Tokyo, and Paris. You can also enter Vietnam overland from neighboring countries, such as China, Laos, and Cambodia, by bus or train. The most popular overland entry points are the border crossings at Lao Cai, Dong Dang, and Moc Bai.

If you're planning to enter Vietnam by land, it's essential to research the requirements for visa on arrival and any necessary documentation, such as a valid passport and health insurance. Additionally, be prepared for potential delays and long queues at border crossings, especially during peak travel seasons. Many travelers also opt to take a bus or train from neighboring countries, which can be a more affordable and scenic way to enter Vietnam.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Vietnam has an extensive domestic air network, with several airlines operating flights between major cities, including Vietnam Airlines, Vietjet Air, and Jetstar Pacific. The main routes connect Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Da Nang, and other popular tourist destinations, such as Nha Trang, Phu Quoc, and Con Dao. Booking domestic flights in advance is recommended, especially during peak travel seasons, as prices tend to increase closer to the departure date. Approximate costs for domestic flights range from $20 to $100 USD, depending on the route and airline.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Vietnam's rail network is moderate, with trains connecting major cities, including Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Da Nang, and Hue. The most popular route is the Reunification Express, which runs from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City, offering stunning views of the countryside and scenic coastline. While there are no high-speed trains in Vietnam, the overnight sleeper trains are a convenient and affordable way to travel long distances. Booking train tickets in advance is recommended, especially during peak travel seasons, and can be done online or at train stations.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Intercity bus companies, such as Futa Bus and Hoang Long, operate extensive networks of routes connecting major cities and towns. The buses are generally comfortable and affordable, with prices ranging from $5 to $20 USD, depending on the route and type of bus. However, the quality of buses and roads can vary, and travel times can be long, especially on rural routes. It's essential to research and book reputable bus companies in advance to ensure a safe and comfortable journey.
