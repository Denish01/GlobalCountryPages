# Vietnam Visa & Entry Requirements

To enter Vietnam, citizens of most countries will need a visa, which can be obtained on arrival, through an e-visa system, or at a Vietnamese embassy or consulate, depending on their nationality and purpose of visit.

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Vietnam before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Vietnam has a moderate visa policy, offering visa-free access to citizens of 24 countries, including Japan, South Korea, and several countries in Southeast Asia, for stays of up to 30 days. Citizens of other countries can apply for a visa on arrival, an e-visa, or a traditional visa at a Vietnamese embassy or consulate. The Vietnamese government has been working to simplify its visa process in recent years, introducing an e-visa system in 2017 and expanding the list of eligible countries.

The visa policy is designed to balance the need to control immigration with the desire to promote tourism and economic development. As a result, the requirements and regulations for obtaining a visa can vary depending on the purpose of the visit and the nationality of the applicant. It is essential to check the latest information before planning a trip to Vietnam.
