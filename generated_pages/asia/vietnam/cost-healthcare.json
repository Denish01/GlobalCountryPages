The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to private healthcare, with longer wait times and less advanced equipment. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the primary option, while foreigners and those with higher incomes tend to opt for private healthcare. The system works on a **fee-for-service** basis, with patients paying out-of-pocket for most medical services. While **health insurance** is not mandatory, it is highly recommended, especially for foreigners, as it can help to cover the costs of medical care and provide access to better quality healthcare.\n\nThe quality of healthcare in Vietnam can vary significantly depending on the location and type of care. In larger cities like **Hanoi** and **Ho Chi Minh City**, there are many high-quality private hospitals and clinics that offer excellent care, while in rural areas, the options may be more limited. For foreigners, it is often recommended to seek care at private hospitals and clinics, which tend to have more English-speaking staff and better equipment. Many private hospitals also offer **international-standard** care, with some even having international accreditation.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | |\n| Specialist Consultation | $20-$50 | $100-$200 | |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-$30 | $30-$70 | |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$30 | $30-$70 | |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $20-$50 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$200 | |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $50-$200 | |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$2,000 | |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,000-$3,000 | |\n| MRI Scan | $100-$300 | |\n| X-Ray | $10-$50 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Outpatient care, basic hospitalization |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-$300 | Inpatient and outpatient care, specialist consultations, surgeries |\n| International / Expat | $200-$500 | Global coverage, including evacuation and repatriation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- **Common medications** like antibiotics and painkillers can be purchased over-the-counter at pharmacies for around $5-$10.\n- **Prescription medications** may require a doctor's prescription and can cost $10-$50 or more, depending on the medication and dosage.\n- **Pharmacy availability** is generally good in larger cities, with many pharmacies open 24/7.\n- **Over-the-counter medications** are widely available, but it is recommended to purchase from reputable pharmacies to ensure authenticity and quality.\n- **Vaccinations** are available at public and private clinics, with costs ranging from $10-$50 or more, depending on the type of vaccination.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a **medical emergency**, it is recommended to call the local emergency number, 115, or go to the nearest hospital. Many private hospitals have **emergency rooms** that are equipped to handle a range of medical emergencies, including accidents, injuries, and illnesses. For foreigners, it is often best to seek care at a private hospital, which may have more English-speaking staff and better equipment. Some of the **best hospitals for foreigners** in Vietnam include the **Franco-Vietnamese Hospital** in Hanoi and the **FV Hospital** in Ho Chi Minh City, both of which offer high-quality care and have international accreditation. \n\nIt is also a good idea to have a **plan in place** for emergency situations, including knowing the location of the nearest hospital and having a way to communicate with medical staff.

Overall, while Vietnam's healthcare system can be complex and variable, there are many good options available for those who need medical care, especially in larger cities.",
