[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Vietnam's **healthcare system** is a mixed model, combining both public and private healthcare providers. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality compared to private healthcare, with longer wait times and less advanced equipment. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the primary option, while foreigners and those with higher incomes tend to opt for private healthcare. The system works on a **fee-for-service** basis, with patients paying out-of-pocket for most medical services. While **health insurance** is not mandatory, it is highly recommended, especially for foreigners, as it can help to cover the costs of medical care and provide access to better quality healthcare.

The quality of healthcare in Vietnam can vary significantly depending on the location and type of care. In larger cities like **Hanoi** and **Ho Chi Minh City**, there are many high-quality private hospitals and clinics that offer excellent care, while in rural areas, the options may be more limited. For foreigners, it is often recommended to seek care at private hospitals and clinics, which tend to have more English-speaking staff and better equipment. Many private hospitals also offer **international-standard** care, with some even having international accreditation.
