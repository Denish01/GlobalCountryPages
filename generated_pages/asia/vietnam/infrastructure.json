  "content": "Vietnam's infrastructure has undergone significant development in recent years, with improvements in roads, power, and telecommunications, although gaps remain between urban and rural areas. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 99%\nInternet Penetration: 70%\nRoad Network: 148,000 km, with moderate quality and ongoing upgrades\nRail Network: 3,162 km\nMajor Airports: 22\nMajor Ports: 13\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nVietnam's infrastructure development has been steadily progressing, driven by government investments and foreign funding. The country has made notable strides in upgrading its transportation networks, energy systems, and telecommunications. However, disparities between urban and rural areas persist, with cities like Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City enjoying better access to modern amenities and services. Recent investments have focused on enhancing the connectivity and efficiency of Vietnam's infrastructure, aiming to support the country's growing economy and increasing demands for services.\n\nThe urban-rural gap is a significant challenge for Vietnam's infrastructure development. While cities have relatively well-developed infrastructure, rural areas often lack access to basic services like clean water, reliable electricity, and quality roads. The government has launched initiatives to address these disparities, including programs to expand electricity access, improve rural roads, and enhance water supply systems. Despite these efforts, much work remains to be done to ensure equitable access to infrastructure services across the country.\n\nVietnam's infrastructure development is also driven by its strategic location and participation in regional trade agreements. The country's proximity to major shipping lanes and its membership in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have made it an attractive location for foreign investment and trade. As a result, Vietnam has been investing in its transportation infrastructure, including ports, airports, and roads, to enhance its connectivity and competitiveness in the region.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 148,000 km | Moderate | Ongoing upgrades to improve quality and safety |\n| Railways | 3,162 km | Good | Limited coverage, with plans for expansion |\n| Airports | 22 international, 10 domestic | Good | Modern facilities, with some capacity constraints |\n| Ports | 13 major | Good | Well-developed, with plans for expansion and modernization |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- Vietnam's power generation is primarily based on **coal** and **natural gas**, with a growing share of **renewable energy** sources like solar and wind power.\n- The country has made significant progress in increasing electricity access, with 99% of the population now having access to power.\n- However, **power outages** and **transmission losses** remain a challenge, particularly in rural areas.\n- Vietnam aims to increase the share of renewable energy in its power mix, with a target of 10% of total generation by 2030.\n- The government has also launched initiatives to improve energy efficiency and reduce energy consumption, including programs to promote the use of **energy-efficient appliances** and **smart grids**.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water safety** is a concern in Vietnam, with many households relying on bottled or filtered water for drinking.\n- Sanitation coverage is relatively high, with over 90% of the population having access to improved sanitation facilities.\n- However, **water access** in rural areas remains a challenge, with many communities lacking access to clean and reliable water supplies.\n- The government has launched initiatives to improve water supply systems, including investments in **water treatment plants** and **pipelines**.\n- Vietnam also faces challenges related to **water pollution**, particularly in urban areas, where industrial and domestic wastewater often contaminates water sources.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is widespread in Vietnam, with over 90% of the population having access to mobile phone services.\n- **Fiber-optic broadband** is available in many urban areas, with ongoing expansion to rural regions.\n- Vietnam has launched **4G** services, with plans to roll out **5G** networks in the near future.\n- The country has a well-developed **postal service**, with a wide range of services available, including express delivery and logistics.\n- Vietnam's telecommunications sector is highly competitive, with several major operators offering a range of services, including **internet**, **phone**, and **television**.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The **North-South Expressway** project aims to upgrade and expand Vietnam's major highway, improving connectivity and reducing travel times.\n- The **Ho Chi Minh City Metro** project is a major urban transportation initiative, with plans to develop a comprehensive metro system.\n- Vietnam has launched initiatives to develop its **renewable energy** sector, including investments in **solar** and **wind power** projects.\n- The government has also announced plans to develop a **new international airport** in Hanoi, with a focus on modern facilities and efficient operations.\n- Vietnam is also investing in its **port infrastructure**, with plans to expand and modernize major ports, including the **Cai Mep-Thi Vai** port complex.",
