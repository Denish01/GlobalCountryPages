[/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nVietnam has a moderate visa policy, offering visa-free access to citizens of 24 countries, including Japan, South Korea, and several countries in Southeast Asia, for stays of up to 30 days. Citizens of other countries can apply for a visa on arrival, an e-visa, or a traditional visa at a Vietnamese embassy or consulate. The Vietnamese government has been working to simplify its visa process in recent years, introducing an e-visa system in 2017 and expanding the list of eligible countries.\n\nThe visa policy is designed to balance the need to control immigration with the desire to promote tourism and economic development. As a result, the requirements and regulations for obtaining a visa can vary depending on the purpose of the visit and the nationality of the applicant. It is essential to check the latest information before planning a trip to Vietnam.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | Yes | Tourist/eVisa | 30 days | Can apply for e-visa or visa on arrival |\n| UK Citizens | Yes | Tourist/eVisa | 30 days | Can apply for e-visa or visa on arrival |\n| EU Citizens | Yes | Tourist/eVisa | 30 days | Can apply for e-visa or visa on arrival, some countries have visa-free access |\n| Canadian Citizens | Yes | Tourist/eVisa | 30 days | Can apply for e-visa or visa on arrival |\n| Australian Citizens | Yes | Tourist/eVisa | 30 days | Can apply for e-visa or visa on arrival |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | Tourist/eVisa | 30 days | Must apply for e-visa in advance |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | Tourist/eVisa | 30 days | Must apply for e-visa in advance, may require additional documentation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can apply for a visa on arrival, an e-visa, or a traditional visa, depending on their nationality and the length of their stay.
