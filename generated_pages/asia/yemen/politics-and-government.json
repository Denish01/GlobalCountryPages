The **executive branch** is headed by the President, who serves as the head of state and government, and is assisted by the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers. The **legislative branch** is composed of a unicameral House of Representatives, which has 301 seats and is elected by popular vote for a six-year term. The **judicial branch** is composed of the Supreme Court and other lower courts, and is responsible for interpreting the law and ensuring that it is applied fairly. Yemen's political system is based on the principles of **sharia law**, which is the primary source of legislation, and **civil law**, which is used in areas not covered by sharia.\n\nThe government of Yemen has been impacted by ongoing conflict and political instability, which has led to a **power vacuum** and the emergence of various factions and militias. The country has been divided between the **Houthi**-controlled north and the **government**-controlled south, with various other groups and factions also vying for power. The conflict has had a significant impact on the country's political system, with many institutions and government agencies struggling to function effectively.\n\nThe separation of powers in Yemen is not always clear-cut, with the executive branch often exerting significant influence over the legislative and judicial branches. The **President** has significant powers, including the ability to appoint and dismiss the Prime Minister and other government officials, as well as the power to dissolve the House of Representatives. The **House of Representatives** has the power to pass laws and approve the budget, but its ability to check the power of the executive branch is limited.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | Presidency | President Rashad al-Alimi | Head of state and government |\n| Executive | Council of Ministers | Prime Minister Maeen Abdulmalik Saeed | Head of government |\n| Legislative | House of Representatives | Speaker of the House | Legislative authority |\n| Judicial | Supreme Court | Chief Justice | Judicial authority |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Major Political Parties [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Party | Position | Leader | Seats | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| General People's Congress | Center-right | Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi | 173 | Dominant party in the government-controlled south |\n| Islah Party | Islamist | Mohammed al-Yadumi | 45 | Influential party with ties to the Muslim Brotherhood |\n| Yemeni Socialist Party | Left-wing | Abdulrahaman al-Akwa | 8 | Secular party with a strong presence in the south |\n| Houthi Movement | Zaidi Shia | Abdul-Malik al-Houthi | 46 | Dominant party in the Houthi-controlled north |\n| National Alliance | Center-left | Yassin Said Noman | 6 | Coalition of smaller parties and independents |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Elections [/SECTION]\n- The electoral system in Yemen is based on a **mixed system**, with some seats allocated by proportional representation and others by single-member districts.\n- Elections are held every six years for the House of Representatives, with the most recent election taking place in 2011.\n- The next election is scheduled to take place in 2023, but its status is uncertain due to the ongoing conflict.\n- Voter participation in Yemen's elections has been relatively low, with turnout averaging around 60% in recent elections.\n\n[SECTION] Political Stability & Challenges [/SECTION]\n- The current political climate in Yemen is highly unstable, with ongoing conflict and a **humanitarian crisis** affecting millions of people.\n- Key issues facing the government include **poverty**, **unemployment**, and **corruption**, as well as the ongoing conflict and the **Houthi insurgency**.\n- Regional dynamics play a significant role in Yemen's politics, with **Saudi Arabia** and **Iran** exerting significant influence over the government and the Houthi movement, respectively.\n- Yemen's **freedom indices** are highly restricted, with the country ranking near the bottom of the world in terms of **press freedom** and **human rights**.\n- The country's **economic stability** is also a major concern, with the economy heavily dependent on **oil exports** and **remittances** from abroad.\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Relations [/SECTION]\n- Yemen is a member of the **United Nations** and the **Arab League**, and has diplomatic relations with over 100 countries.\n- The country has **key alliances** with **Saudi Arabia** and the **United Arab Emirates**, which have provided significant military and economic support to the government.\n- Yemen is also a member of the **International Monetary Fund** and the **World Bank**, and has received significant economic assistance from these institutions.\n- The country's **diplomatic stance** is generally **pro-Western**, but it has also sought to maintain good relations with **Iran** and other regional powers.\n- Yemen's **regional role** is significant, with the country playing a key role in regional organizations such as the **Gulf Cooperation Council**.",
