[SECTION] Overview: Yemen vs Somalia [/SECTION]
Yemen and Somalia are two countries located in the Arabian Peninsula and the Horn of Africa, respectively. Both countries have faced significant economic challenges in recent years, including conflict, poverty, and lack of infrastructure. However, Yemen is generally considered to be cheaper than Somalia, with a lower cost of living and more affordable prices for basic necessities like food, housing, and transportation. The economic context of both countries is complex, with Yemen's economy heavily reliant on oil exports and Somalia's economy struggling to recover from decades of conflict and instability.

The cost of living in Yemen is lower than in Somalia, with prices for everyday items like food, housing, and transportation generally 20-30% cheaper. This is due in part to Yemen's larger economy and more developed infrastructure, which allows for greater competition and lower prices. Additionally, Yemen's currency, the Yemeni rial, has been relatively stable in recent years, which has helped to keep prices low. In contrast, Somalia's economy is still recovering from decades of conflict and instability, and prices for basic necessities are often higher due to a lack of infrastructure and competition.
