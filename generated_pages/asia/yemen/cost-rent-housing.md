[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Yemen's housing market is largely driven by demand for low-to-medium cost housing, with a significant portion of the population living in informal settlements or traditional villages. The rental market in Yemen is relatively unregulated, with typical lease terms ranging from 6-12 months, and deposit requirements usually equivalent to one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are limited, and disputes are often resolved through informal mediation. Compared to regional neighbors such as Saudi Arabia and Oman, Yemen's housing costs are relatively low, making it an attractive option for expats and locals alike. However, the country's ongoing conflict and economic instability have led to a decline in the overall quality and availability of housing, particularly in urban areas.

The housing market in Yemen is also influenced by the country's cultural and social norms, with a strong emphasis on family and community ties. Many Yemenis prefer to live in close proximity to their extended family members, and the concept of **compound living** is common, where multiple families share a large house or complex. This has led to a high demand for large, multi-bedroom apartments and houses, particularly in urban areas. Additionally, the lack of formal housing finance options and limited access to credit have made it difficult for many Yemenis to purchase their own homes, further driving the demand for rental housing.
