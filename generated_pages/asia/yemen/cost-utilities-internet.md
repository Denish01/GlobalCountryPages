[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Yemen's utility infrastructure has faced significant challenges in recent years, including damage to power plants, water treatment facilities, and transmission lines. As a result, the quality of utility services can be inconsistent, with frequent power outages and water shortages reported in some areas. The cost of utilities in Yemen can also fluctuate due to seasonal variation, with higher demand for electricity and water during the hot summer months. In addition, the ongoing conflict in the country has led to shortages of fuel and other essential supplies, which can impact the stability of utility prices.

The cost of utilities in Yemen is also affected by the country's economic situation, with a large proportion of the population relying on **out-of-pocket** payments for healthcare and other essential services. According to the World Bank, out-of-pocket health expenditure in Yemen accounts for 69.1% of total health expenditure, which can put a significant burden on households. As a result, many people in Yemen have to prioritize their spending on essential utilities such as electricity, water, and gas, which can be a challenge given the fluctuating costs.
