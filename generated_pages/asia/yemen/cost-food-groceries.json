The cost of basic food items such as bread, rice, and vegetables can fluctuate depending on the availability of supplies and the time of year. Yemenis tend to prefer home cooking over eating out, and traditional dishes such as **saltah** (a stew made with meat or fish, vegetables, and spices) and **mandhi** (a dish made with meat, rice, and spices) are staples of the local cuisine. However, in urban areas such as Sanaa and Aden, there is a growing trend towards eating out, with many restaurants and cafes serving a range of local and international dishes.\n\nThe eating-out culture in Yemen is still relatively underdeveloped compared to other countries in the region, but there are many affordable options available, including street food vendors and local eateries. These establishments often serve traditional Yemeni dishes at very low prices, making them a popular option for locals and visitors alike. However, the quality of the food can vary greatly depending on the establishment, and visitors should take necessary precautions to ensure food safety.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $1.50 | 375 YER | |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $0.50 | 125 YER | |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $1.20 | 300 YER | |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $1.00 | 250 YER | |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $3.50 | 875 YER | |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $6.00 | 1,500 YER | |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $2.50 | 625 YER | |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $1.00 | 250 YER | |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $0.80 | 200 YER | |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $0.60 | 150 YER | |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $4.00 | 1,000 YER | |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $0.50 | 125 YER | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $2-$5 | (typical dishes such as saltah or mandhi) |\n| Casual Restaurant | $5-$10 | (one person, includes drink and dessert) |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $15-$30 | (3 courses, includes drink and dessert) |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $30-$50 | (upscale, includes drink and dessert) |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $5-$10 | |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $8-$15 | |\n| Cappuccino | $2-$5 | |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $1-$3 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nThe prices of grocery items can vary significantly depending on whether you shop at a supermarket or a local market. Supermarkets tend to be more expensive, but they often offer a wider range of products, including imported items. Local markets, on the other hand, are generally cheaper, but the quality of the products can vary greatly. Visitors should be prepared to **haggle** when shopping at local markets, as this is a common practice in Yemen. It's also a good idea to buy fresh produce and other perishable items at local markets, where they are often cheaper and fresher.\n\nIn general, it's a good idea to buy staples such as rice, bread, and vegetables at local markets, where they are often significantly cheaper than at supermarkets. However, for imported items such as cheese, meat, and canned goods, supermarkets may be the better option. Visitors should also be aware that some items, such as fresh meat and dairy products, may be more expensive at supermarkets due to the higher costs of refrigeration and storage.\n\n[SECTION] Local Food Tips [/SECTION]\n- The **cheapest way to eat** in Yemen is to buy food from street vendors or local eateries, where a meal can cost as little as $2-$3 USD.\n- **Local staples** such as rice, bread, and vegetables are generally good value and can be bought at low prices at local markets.\n- **Avoid buying imported items** such as cheese, meat, and canned goods, which can be very expensive in Yemen.\n- **Fresh produce** such as fruits and vegetables are often cheaper and fresher at local markets.\n- **Haggling** is a common practice in Yemen, so be prepared to negotiate prices when shopping at local markets.\n- **Traditional Yemeni dishes** such as saltah and mandhi are often made with local ingredients and can be a delicious and affordable option for visitors.",
