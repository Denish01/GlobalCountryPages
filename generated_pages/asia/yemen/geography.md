[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Yemen is situated in the southwestern corner of the Arabian Peninsula, with a strategic location that connects the Middle East to Africa and Asia. The country shares borders with two countries: Saudi Arabia to the north and Oman to the east. Yemen is also surrounded by two major bodies of water: the Red Sea to the west and the Gulf of Aden to the south. This unique location has made Yemen an important hub for trade and cultural exchange throughout history.

The country's borders with Saudi Arabia and Oman are largely desert regions, with the Empty Quarter (Rub' al Khali) desert covering much of the northern and eastern parts of Yemen. The border with Saudi Arabia is approximately 1,458 kilometers long, while the border with Oman is about 288 kilometers long. Yemen's coastline, on the other hand, is about 2,500 kilometers long, providing access to the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Yemen's terrain is characterized by a diverse range of landscapes, including mountains, deserts, and coastal plains. The western part of the country is dominated by the **Sarawat Mountains**, which run along the Red Sea coast and include the highest peak in Yemen, Jabal an Nabi Shu'ayb. The mountains are rugged and steep, with deep valleys and gorges carved out by rivers and streams. The eastern part of the country, on the other hand, is largely desert, with the Empty Quarter (Rub' al Khali) desert covering much of the region.

The coastal plains of Yemen are narrow and fertile, with several major rivers flowing through them, including the **Wadi Hadhrami** and the **Wadi Tuban**. These rivers support agriculture and provide water for the country's population. The deserts of Yemen are also home to several important oases, including the **Hadramawt Valley**, which is known for its lush vegetation and fertile soil.

Yemen's coastline is also home to several important islands, including **Socotra Island**, which is located in the Gulf of Aden and is known for its unique biodiversity and natural beauty. The island is home to several endemic species, including the **dragon's blood tree** and the **cucumber tree**, and is a popular destination for eco-tourists and nature lovers.
