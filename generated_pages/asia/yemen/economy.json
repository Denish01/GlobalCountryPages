  "content": "Yemen's economy is driven by a mix of traditional industries, such as agriculture and fishing, and a growing services sector, although it has been severely impacted by conflict and instability in recent years.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nGDP (nominal): ($31 billion estimate)\nGDP Per Capita: ($943 estimate)\nIncome Classification: Low\nMain Industries: Oil and gas, Agriculture, Fishing\nCurrency: YER\nUnemployment Rate: (approximate 30%)\nEase of Doing Business: (general ranking context: 187 out of 190 countries)\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]\nYemen is a low-income economy, with a GDP per capita of less than $1,000. The country has been facing significant development challenges, including a large population, limited natural resources, and a lack of infrastructure. The economy has been heavily reliant on oil and gas exports, which have been declining in recent years due to depletion of reserves and conflict. Yemen's economic classification is a lower-middle-income economy, but it has been downgraded to a low-income economy due to the ongoing conflict and humanitarian crisis.\n\nThe country's economic development level is relatively low, with a human development index (HDI) ranking of 179 out of 189 countries. The economy has been growing slowly, with a growth rate of around 2-3% per annum, but this growth has been uneven and has not been able to keep pace with the growing population. The trajectory of the economy is uncertain, with the ongoing conflict and humanitarian crisis posing significant challenges to economic development.\n\nYemen's economy is also heavily reliant on remittances from migrant workers, with many Yemenis working in other countries in the region, such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The country is also vulnerable to external shocks, such as changes in global oil prices, which can have a significant impact on the economy.\n\n[SECTION] Key Industries [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Industry | Contribution | Details |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Agriculture | 20% of GDP | Main crops include coffee, cotton, and fruits and vegetables |\n| Oil and Gas | 30% of GDP | Yemen has significant oil and gas reserves, but production has been declining in recent years |\n| Fishing | 5% of GDP | Yemen has a significant fishing industry, with many fishermen operating in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden |\n| Manufacturing | 10% of GDP | Main products include textiles, food processing, and construction materials |\n| Services | 35% of GDP | Main services include finance, trade, and tourism |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Trade Profile [/SECTION]\n**Top Exports:** \n- **Crude Oil**: Yemen's main export, with most of it going to China and other countries in Asia\n- **Refined Petroleum Products**: Yemen also exports refined petroleum products, such as diesel and gasoline\n- **Coffee**: Yemen is known for its high-quality coffee, which is exported to countries around the world\n- **Fish and Seafood**: Yemen's fishing industry is significant, with many fish and seafood products being exported to other countries\n- **Textiles**: Yemen also exports textiles, such as cotton and synthetic fabrics\n\n**Top Imports:** \n- **Food and Beverages**: Yemen imports a significant amount of food and beverages, including wheat, rice, and sugar\n- **Machinery and Equipment**: Yemen imports machinery and equipment, including vehicles and electronics\n- **Fuel and Petroleum Products**: Yemen imports fuel and petroleum products, including diesel and gasoline\n- **Chemicals and Fertilizers**: Yemen imports chemicals and fertilizers, which are used in the agricultural sector\n- **Pharmaceuticals**: Yemen imports pharmaceuticals, which are used in the healthcare sector\n\n**Key Trading Partners:** \n- Saudi Arabia: Yemen's main trading partner, with many Yemenis working in Saudi Arabia and sending remittances back home\n- China: Yemen also has significant trade relations with China, which is a major importer of Yemeni oil and other products\n- United Arab Emirates: The UAE is another significant trading partner, with many Yemenis working in the UAE and sending remittances back home\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n- Transport networks: Yemen has a relatively underdeveloped transport network, with many roads and highways in poor condition\n- Energy: Yemen has significant oil and gas reserves, but the energy sector is underdeveloped, with many areas of the country lacking access to electricity\n- Internet and mobile penetration: Yemen has a relatively low level of internet and mobile penetration, with around 20% of the population having access to the internet\n- Ports and airports: Yemen has several major ports, including the port of Aden and the port of Hudaydah, as well as several international airports, including Sanaa International Airport\n\n[SECTION] Economic Outlook [/SECTION]\nYemen's economic outlook is uncertain, with the ongoing conflict and humanitarian crisis posing significant challenges to economic development. The country is in need of significant investment in infrastructure, including roads, energy, and telecommunications. The government has also announced plans to diversify the economy, including by developing the tourism and manufacturing sectors. However, these plans are likely to be put on hold until the conflict is resolved and stability is restored.\n\nIn the short term, Yemen's economy is likely to continue to struggle, with the conflict and humanitarian crisis having a significant impact on economic activity. The country is also vulnerable to external shocks, such as changes in global oil prices, which can have a significant impact on the economy. However, in the long term, Yemen has significant potential for economic growth and development, with a large and growing population, significant natural resources, and a strategic location in the region. With the right policies and investment, Yemen could become a significant economic player in the region, with a diversified economy and a high standard of living.",
