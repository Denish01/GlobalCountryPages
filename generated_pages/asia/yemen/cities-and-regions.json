The governorates are the primary administrative divisions, and each one has its own capital city and local government.

The governorates are responsible for providing local services, such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure, and they also have a degree of autonomy in managing their own affairs.\n\nThe division of Yemen into governorates is based on a combination of geographical, historical, and cultural factors. Some governorates, such as Sanaa and Taiz, are densely populated and have a strong urban character, while others, such as Hadhramaut and Mahra, are more sparsely populated and have a stronger tribal identity. The governorates also vary in terms of their economic development, with some, such as Aden and Hudaydah, having a stronger industrial and commercial base, while others, such as Saada and Al Jawf, are more agricultural and rural.\n\n[SECTION] Major Cities [/SECTION]\n**Sanaa** (2,575,347)\nRole: capital, cultural center\nKnown For: Sanaa is known for its rich history and cultural heritage, with many ancient mosques, madrasas, and other historical landmarks.
