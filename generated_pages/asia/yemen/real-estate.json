  "content": "The property market in Yemen is currently challenging due to the country's ongoing conflict and economic instability, but foreigners can buy property with certain restrictions. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nCan Foreigners Buy?: Restricted\nAverage Price (Capital, per sqm): $150 USD\nRental Yield: 5%\nProperty Tax: 2%\nPopular Areas: Sanaa, Aden, Taiz\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Market Overview [/SECTION]\nThe Yemeni property market has been severely impacted by the ongoing civil war, which has led to a significant decline in property values and a decrease in demand. The market is largely driven by local demand, with limited interest from foreign investors. However, there are still opportunities for investment in certain areas, particularly in the capital city of Sanaa and other major urban centers. The price trajectory of properties in Yemen has been volatile, with prices fluctuating significantly over the past few years due to the conflict and economic instability. Urban areas tend to be more expensive than rural areas, with prices in Sanaa and other major cities being significantly higher than in smaller towns and villages.\n\nThe current market conditions in Yemen are characterized by a surplus of supply, with many properties available for sale or rent. This has led to a buyer's market, with buyers having significant negotiating power. However, the lack of infrastructure and basic services in many areas, particularly in rural regions, can make it difficult to find and purchase properties. The trend in the Yemeni property market is towards more affordable and smaller properties, as many buyers are looking for budget-friendly options.\n\nDespite the challenges, there are still opportunities for investment in the Yemeni property market, particularly in areas with potential for growth and development. The government has implemented various initiatives to attract foreign investment and stimulate economic growth, including the establishment of free zones and investment incentives. However, investors must carefully consider the risks and challenges associated with investing in Yemen, including the ongoing conflict and economic instability.\n\n[SECTION] Prices by Area [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area/City | Buy (per sqm, USD) | Rent (monthly, USD) | Type |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Sanaa | 200 | 100 | Apartment |\n| Aden | 150 | 80 | House |\n| Taiz | 120 | 60 | Apartment |\n| Mukalla | 100 | 50 | House |\n| Hudaydah | 80 | 40 | Apartment |\n| Ibb | 60 | 30 | House |\n| Dhamar | 50 | 25 | Apartment |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Ownership Rules [/SECTION]\n- Foreigners are allowed to buy property in Yemen, but they must obtain a permit from the Ministry of Interior and the General Authority for Investment.\n- Foreigners can only buy property for residential or commercial purposes, and not for agricultural or industrial purposes.\n- Foreigners must have a valid residence visa to purchase property in Yemen.\n- Foreign companies can own property in Yemen, but they must be registered with the Ministry of Trade and Industry.\n- Foreigners can lease property in Yemen for a period of up to 99 years, with the option to renew the lease.\n\n[SECTION] Buying Process [/SECTION]\n1.
