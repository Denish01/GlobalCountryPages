[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Yemen is divided into three main stages: primary, secondary, and tertiary education. Primary education, which is compulsory, lasts for 6 years, followed by 3 years of secondary education. The quality of education in Yemen varies, with public schools facing challenges such as inadequate infrastructure, limited resources, and a shortage of qualified teachers. Private schools, on the other hand, offer better facilities and more qualified teachers, but are often expensive and inaccessible to many students. The Yemeni government has implemented various reforms to improve the education system, including the introduction of new curricula and teacher training programs.

The education system in Yemen is overseen by the Ministry of Education, which is responsible for developing and implementing education policies, as well as managing the country's schools and universities. Despite the challenges it faces, the education system in Yemen has made significant progress in recent years, with an increase in enrollment rates and a decrease in illiteracy rates. However, more needs to be done to address the existing gaps and ensure that all students have access to quality education.

Yemen's tertiary education sector is also growing, with a number of universities and colleges offering a range of academic programs. These institutions are accredited by the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research, which is responsible for ensuring that they meet the required standards. Students who graduate from these institutions can pursue careers in various fields, including medicine, engineering, law, and business.
