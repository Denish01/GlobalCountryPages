[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Yemen's healthcare system is a mixed model, comprising both public and private providers. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, with limited resources and outdated equipment. In contrast, private healthcare facilities are better equipped and staffed, but are often expensive and inaccessible to the majority of the population. For locals, the public healthcare system is the primary source of care, while foreigners and those who can afford it often opt for private facilities. Having health insurance is recommended, as it can help cover the high out-of-pocket costs associated with healthcare in Yemen.

The healthcare system in Yemen is also affected by the country's ongoing conflict, which has led to a shortage of medical supplies, staff, and facilities. As a result, many people rely on traditional medicine or seek care from unqualified practitioners, which can exacerbate health problems. For foreigners, it is essential to have a comprehensive health insurance plan that covers emergency medical evacuations, as the quality of care in Yemen may not meet international standards.

[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]
- Common medications such as antibiotics and painkillers can cost between $5-$10 per prescription.
- Prescription rules vary by pharmacy and doctor, but generally require a doctor's note or prescription.
- Pharmacies are widely available in urban areas, but may be scarce in rural areas.
- Over-the-counter medications such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen are widely available and relatively inexpensive.
- Medication prices can vary significantly depending on the brand, quality, and availability.
- It is recommended to bring a sufficient supply of personal medications, as availability and quality may be limited in Yemen.

[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]
In the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the local emergency number, 199, or seek immediate attention at the nearest hospital. However, ambulance services may be limited, and emergency care may not always be available. For foreigners, it is recommended to have a comprehensive health insurance plan that covers emergency medical evacuations, as the quality of care in Yemen may not meet international standards. The best hospitals for foreigners in Yemen are typically private facilities, such as the **Al-Thawra Hospital** in Sanaa or the **Al-Sabah Hospital** in Aden, which offer better equipment and staff, but may be expensive. It is also recommended to research and identify reputable hospitals and medical providers before seeking care.
