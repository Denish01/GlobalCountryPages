[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Yemen is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **executive branch** is headed by the President, who serves as the head of state and government, and is assisted by the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers. The **legislative branch** is composed of a unicameral House of Representatives, which has 301 seats and is elected by popular vote for a six-year term. The **judicial branch** is composed of the Supreme Court and other lower courts, and is responsible for interpreting the law and ensuring that it is applied fairly. Yemen's political system is based on the principles of **sharia law**, which is the primary source of legislation, and **civil law**, which is used in areas not covered by sharia.

The government of Yemen has been impacted by ongoing conflict and political instability, which has led to a **power vacuum** and the emergence of various factions and militias. The country has been divided between the **Houthi**-controlled north and the **government**-controlled south, with various other groups and factions also vying for power. The conflict has had a significant impact on the country's political system, with many institutions and government agencies struggling to function effectively.

The separation of powers in Yemen is not always clear-cut, with the executive branch often exerting significant influence over the legislative and judicial branches. The **President** has significant powers, including the ability to appoint and dismiss the Prime Minister and other government officials, as well as the power to dissolve the House of Representatives. The **House of Representatives** has the power to pass laws and approve the budget, but its ability to check the power of the executive branch is limited.
