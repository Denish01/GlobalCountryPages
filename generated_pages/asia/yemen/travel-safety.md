[SECTION] Overall Safety Assessment [/SECTION]
Yemen has been embroiled in a complex and multifaceted conflict since 2015, which has led to a significant deterioration in the security situation. The country is plagued by terrorism, kidnappings, and armed clashes between various factions, making it a highly unstable and dangerous environment for tourists. Additionally, the country's infrastructure, including healthcare and emergency services, has been severely impacted by the conflict, making it challenging for travelers to access basic necessities.

The conflict has also led to a significant increase in crime, including petty theft, armed robbery, and violent attacks. The lack of effective law enforcement and the presence of armed groups have created an environment in which criminals can operate with impunity. Furthermore, the country's economy has been severely affected, leading to widespread poverty and desperation, which has contributed to the rise in crime. As a result, travelers should exercise extreme caution when visiting Yemen and be aware of their surroundings at all times.
