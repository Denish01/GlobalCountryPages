# Yemen Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

Yemen's infrastructure is underdeveloped and faces significant challenges due to years of conflict, lack of investment, and limited access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 55% of population
Internet Penetration: 25%
Road Network: 71,300 km, poor quality due to lack of maintenance
Rail Network: none
Major Airports: 4
Major Ports: 4
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Yemen's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other countries in the region. The country has faced significant challenges in recent years, including a devastating civil war, which has led to a decline in the overall state of its infrastructure. Recent investments have been limited, and the urban-rural gap in terms of access to basic services is significant. In urban areas, access to electricity, water, and sanitation is generally better, but still faces frequent outages and disruptions. In rural areas, access to these basic services is often limited, and communities rely on traditional methods such as wells and generators for their daily needs.

The lack of investment in infrastructure has also had a significant impact on the country's economy. The limited access to electricity, water, and sanitation has hindered the growth of industries such as manufacturing and tourism, which are critical to the country's economic development. Furthermore, the poor state of the road network has made it difficult to transport goods and people, leading to higher costs and reduced economic activity.

Despite these challenges, there are efforts underway to improve the state of Yemen's infrastructure. International organizations and donor countries have provided funding for various infrastructure projects, including the rehabilitation of roads, the expansion of electricity generation, and the improvement of water and sanitation services. However, more needs to be done to address the significant infrastructure gaps in the country.
