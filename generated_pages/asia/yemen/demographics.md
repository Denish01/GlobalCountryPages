[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Yemen's population size is significant in the context of the Arabian Peninsula, with the country experiencing rapid growth trends over the past few decades. The population growth rate is approximately 2.3%, which is one of the highest in the region. Urbanization is also on the rise, with about 34% of the population living in urban areas, primarily in cities such as Sanaa, Aden, and Taiz. However, migration patterns have been affected by the ongoing conflict and economic instability, with many Yemenis seeking refuge in neighboring countries or migrating to other parts of the world in search of better opportunities. The country's population is also characterized by a high total fertility rate, with an average of 4.4 children per woman, which puts a strain on the country's resources and infrastructure.

The population of Yemen is also affected by the country's limited resources and infrastructure, which can make it challenging to provide basic services such as healthcare, education, and sanitation to the growing population. The government has implemented various initiatives to address these challenges, including family planning programs and investments in healthcare and education. However, more needs to be done to address the country's demographic challenges and ensure that the population growth is sustainable and equitable.

Yemen's population is also characterized by a high percentage of young people, with approximately 60% of the population under the age of 25. This demographic dividend can be a significant asset for the country's economic development, but it also poses challenges in terms of providing education, employment, and other opportunities for young people.
