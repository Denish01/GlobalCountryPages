Public schools in Yemen are generally considered to be of lower quality compared to private schools, with limited resources and outdated teaching methods. The language of instruction in Yemeni schools is Arabic, and English is taught as a second language. Compulsory education in Yemen lasts for 9 years, starting from the age of 6 and ending at the age of 15. International schools are available in major cities, offering a range of curricula including British, American, and International Baccalaureate.\n\nThe quality of education in Yemen's public schools is a major concern, with many schools lacking basic facilities such as clean water, sanitation, and electricity. In contrast, private schools in Yemen are generally of higher quality, with better facilities and more qualified teachers. However, these schools are often expensive, making them inaccessible to many Yemeni families. International schools in Yemen offer a high-quality education, but are typically very expensive and cater mainly to expatriate families.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 (free) | Limited resources, outdated teaching methods |\n| Private Primary | $200-$1,000 | Range of quality, from basic to high-end |\n| Public Secondary | $0 (free) | Limited resources, outdated teaching methods |\n| Private Secondary | $500-$2,500 | Range of quality, from basic to high-end |\n| International School | $5,000-$15,000 | British, American, and IB curricula available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $100-$500 | $500-$1,000 | Limited programs, outdated facilities |\n| Private University | $1,000-$5,000 | $2,000-$10,000 | Range of quality, from basic to high-end |\n| Top-Ranked University | $2,000-$10,000 | $5,000-$20,000 | University of Sanaa, limited programs |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $50-$200 | Limited availability, variable quality |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $10-$50 | Range of subjects, variable quality |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $100-$500 | English, Arabic, and other languages available |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $20-$100 | Basic supplies, variable quality |\n| School Uniform | $20-$50 | Required for most schools |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The best schools for expats in Yemen are typically international schools, which offer a high-quality education and a range of curricula.\n- Scholarships are available for Yemeni students, but are limited and highly competitive.\n- Online learning options are becoming increasingly popular in Yemen, with many universities and schools offering online courses and degree programs.\n- The education quality in Yemen is generally considered to be lower than in other countries in the region, due to limited resources and outdated teaching methods.\n- [CALLOUT] It is essential for parents to research schools thoroughly and visit them in person before making a decision, as the quality of education can vary significantly from one school to another.\n- The **Ministry of Education** in Yemen is responsible for overseeing the education system, and provides information on schools, universities, and education policies.",
