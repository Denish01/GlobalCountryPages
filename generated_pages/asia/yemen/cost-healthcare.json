  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Yemen varies significantly between public and private facilities, with an average health expenditure per capita of $48 and out-of-pocket spending accounting for 69.1% of total health expenditure.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $48\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 69.1%\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 199\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: YER\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nYemen's healthcare system is a mixed model, comprising both public and private providers. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, with limited resources and outdated equipment. In contrast, private healthcare facilities are better equipped and staffed, but are often expensive and inaccessible to the majority of the population. For locals, the public healthcare system is the primary source of care, while foreigners and those who can afford it often opt for private facilities. Having health insurance is recommended, as it can help cover the high out-of-pocket costs associated with healthcare in Yemen.\n\nThe healthcare system in Yemen is also affected by the country's ongoing conflict, which has led to a shortage of medical supplies, staff, and facilities. As a result, many people rely on traditional medicine or seek care from unqualified practitioners, which can exacerbate health problems. For foreigners, it is essential to have a comprehensive health insurance plan that covers emergency medical evacuations, as the quality of care in Yemen may not meet international standards.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $5-$10 | $20-$50 | Prices vary by city and doctor's qualifications |\n| Specialist Consultation | $10-$20 | $50-$100 | Prices vary by specialty and doctor's experience |\n| Dental Checkup | $5-$10 | $20-$50 | Prices vary by dentist's qualifications and location |\n| Eye Exam | $5-$10 | $20-$50 | Prices vary by optometrist's qualifications and location |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $20-$50 | Prices vary by laboratory and test type |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $20-$50 | Prices vary by hospital and severity of condition |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $20-$100 | Prices vary by hospital and type of accommodation |\n| Basic Surgery | $100-$500 | Prices vary by type of surgery and surgeon's experience |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $100-$500 | Prices vary by hospital and type of delivery |\n| MRI Scan | $100-$300 | Prices vary by hospital and type of scan |\n| X-Ray | $10-$50 | Prices vary by hospital and type of X-ray |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $10-$20 | Outpatient care, basic surgeries, and hospital stays |\n| Comprehensive Private | $50-$100 | Outpatient care, specialist consultations, surgeries, and hospital stays |\n| International / Expat | $100-$500 | Emergency medical evacuations, comprehensive medical coverage, and access to international healthcare providers |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Common medications such as antibiotics and painkillers can cost between $5-$10 per prescription.\n- Prescription rules vary by pharmacy and doctor, but generally require a doctor's note or prescription.\n- Pharmacies are widely available in urban areas, but may be scarce in rural areas.\n- Over-the-counter medications such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen are widely available and relatively inexpensive.\n- Medication prices can vary significantly depending on the brand, quality, and availability.\n- It is recommended to bring a sufficient supply of personal medications, as availability and quality may be limited in Yemen.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the local emergency number, 199, or seek immediate attention at the nearest hospital. However, ambulance services may be limited, and emergency care may not always be available. For foreigners, it is recommended to have a comprehensive health insurance plan that covers emergency medical evacuations, as the quality of care in Yemen may not meet international standards. The best hospitals for foreigners in Yemen are typically private facilities, such as the **Al-Thawra Hospital** in Sanaa or the **Al-Sabah Hospital** in Aden, which offer better equipment and staff, but may be expensive. It is also recommended to research and identify reputable hospitals and medical providers before seeking care.",
