[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Yemen has two main international airports, Sana'a International Airport (SAH) and Aden International Airport (ADE), which receive flights from major hubs in the Middle East, such as Dubai, Cairo, and Istanbul. Direct flights to Yemen are limited, and most travelers will need to connect through one of these hubs. Overland entry points are also available, with border crossings from Saudi Arabia and Oman, although these can be subject to closures and restrictions due to security concerns. Travelers should check the latest information before attempting to cross the border by land.

The main entry points for overland travel are the border crossings at Al Wadiah and Haradh in the north, and the port city of Aden in the south. These entry points are subject to strict security checks, and travelers should be prepared for delays and potential closures. Additionally, the security situation in Yemen can be volatile, and travelers should exercise extreme caution when entering the country by land. It is also recommended to check with the relevant authorities for any specific requirements or restrictions on overland travel.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Domestic flights in Yemen are limited, with only a few airlines operating within the country. **Yemenia** is the national carrier, and it operates flights between Sana'a, Aden, and other major cities. Booking domestic flights can be challenging, as online booking systems are not always available, and it may be necessary to visit a travel agent or the airline's office in person. Approximate costs for domestic flights are around $100-$200 USD per person, depending on the route and airline. Travelers should be prepared for delays and cancellations, as the domestic air network is subject to disruption due to security concerns and other factors.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Yemen does not have a rail network, so train travel is not an option. This means that travelers will need to rely on other forms of transportation, such as buses, taxis, and domestic flights, to get around the country.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Intercity bus companies operate in Yemen, although the quality of the buses and the roads can be poor. Bus travel is a relatively affordable option, with costs starting from around $10-$20 USD per person, depending on the route and operator. However, the journey times can be long, and the buses may not always be comfortable or reliable. Some of the main bus companies operating in Yemen include **Yemen Tourist Transport** and **Saba Bus Company**.
