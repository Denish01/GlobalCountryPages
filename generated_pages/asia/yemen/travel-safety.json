The country is plagued by terrorism, kidnappings, and armed clashes between various factions, making it a highly unstable and dangerous environment for tourists. Additionally, the country's infrastructure, including healthcare and emergency services, has been severely impacted by the conflict, making it challenging for travelers to access basic necessities.\n\nThe conflict has also led to a significant increase in crime, including petty theft, armed robbery, and violent attacks. The lack of effective law enforcement and the presence of armed groups have created an environment in which criminals can operate with impunity. Furthermore, the country's economy has been severely affected, leading to widespread poverty and desperation, which has contributed to the rise in crime. As a result, travelers should exercise extreme caution when visiting Yemen and be aware of their surroundings at all times.\n\n[SECTION] Safety By Area [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area/Region | Safety Level | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Sanaa | High Risk | Avoid non-essential travel due to ongoing conflict and terrorism |\n| Aden | High Risk | Risk of kidnappings, armed clashes, and terrorism |\n| Taiz | High Risk | Ongoing conflict and terrorism, avoid non-essential travel |\n| Socotra Island | Moderate Risk | Relative stability, but risk of piracy and armed robbery |\n| Marib | High Risk | Ongoing conflict and terrorism, avoid non-essential travel |\n| Hadhramaut | Moderate Risk | Risk of kidnappings and armed clashes, but relative stability |\n| Al-Mahra | Moderate Risk | Risk of kidnappings and armed clashes, but relative stability |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Common Risks & Scams [/SECTION]\n- **Kidnappings**: There is a high risk of kidnappings, particularly in areas controlled by armed groups.\n- **Armed robbery**: Armed robbery is a significant risk, particularly in urban areas.\n- **Terrorism**: There is a high risk of terrorist attacks, particularly in areas controlled by extremist groups.\n- **Piracy**: There is a risk of piracy, particularly in the Gulf of Aden.\n- **Scams**: Scams are common, particularly in tourist areas, and can include theft, fraud, and extortion.\n- **Traffic accidents**: Traffic accidents are common due to poor road conditions and reckless driving.\n- **Health risks**: There is a high risk of waterborne and foodborne illnesses due to poor sanitation and hygiene.\n- **Armed clashes**: There is a high risk of armed clashes between various factions, which can lead to injury or death.\n\n[SECTION] Health & Medical [/SECTION]\n- **Vaccinations**: Travelers should ensure they are up-to-date on all routine vaccinations, as well as **Hepatitis A**, **Typhoid**, and **Rabies**.\n- **Water Safety**: Tap water is not safe to drink, and travelers should use bottled or filtered water.\n- **Medical Facilities**: Medical facilities are limited, and travelers may need to be evacuated to another country for medical treatment.\n- **Pharmacy Access**: Pharmacy access is limited, and travelers should bring any necessary medications with them.\n\n[SECTION] Practical Safety Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be aware of your surroundings at all times and avoid traveling alone.\n- Avoid displaying signs of wealth, such as jewelry or expensive watches.\n- Keep valuables secure and use a hotel safe or a secure bag.\n- Avoid traveling at night, particularly in rural areas.\n- Use a reputable taxi service or ride-sharing app.\n- Avoid discussing sensitive topics, such as politics or religion.\n- Keep your hotel room door locked and use a deadbolt.\n- Stay informed about local conditions and follow local advice.\n\n[SECTION] For Solo & Women Travelers [/SECTION]\n- **Dress modestly**: Women should dress modestly and cover their hair and body to avoid attracting unwanted attention.\n- **Avoid traveling alone**: Solo travelers, particularly women, should avoid traveling alone and use a reputable tour guide or join a group tour.\n- **Be respectful of local customs**: Travelers should be respectful of local customs and traditions, particularly in rural areas.\n- **Stay in touch with family and friends**: Solo travelers should stay in touch with family and friends and keep them informed of their itinerary and whereabouts.",
