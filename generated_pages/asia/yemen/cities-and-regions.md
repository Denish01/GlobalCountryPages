[SECTION] How Yemen Is Divided [/SECTION]
Yemen is a sovereign country located on the Arabian Peninsula, and its administrative structure is divided into 22 governorates, which are further subdivided into districts and sub-districts. The governorates are the primary administrative divisions, and each one has its own capital city and local government. The country's capital, Sanaa, is also the largest city and serves as the center of government, economy, and culture. The governorates are responsible for providing local services, such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure, and they also have a degree of autonomy in managing their own affairs.

The division of Yemen into governorates is based on a combination of geographical, historical, and cultural factors. Some governorates, such as Sanaa and Taiz, are densely populated and have a strong urban character, while others, such as Hadhramaut and Mahra, are more sparsely populated and have a stronger tribal identity. The governorates also vary in terms of their economic development, with some, such as Aden and Hudaydah, having a stronger industrial and commercial base, while others, such as Saada and Al Jawf, are more agricultural and rural.
