[SECTION] How Yemen Is Divided [/SECTION]
Yemen is divided into 22 governorates, which are further subdivided into districts, sub-districts, and villages. The governorates are the primary administrative divisions of the country, and each has its own governor and administration. The capital city, Sanaa, is the largest city in the country and serves as the administrative and economic hub. The governorates are responsible for providing various public services, including healthcare, education, and infrastructure development.

The division of Yemen into governorates is based on geographical, historical, and cultural factors. Each governorate has its own unique character and identity, shaped by its history, culture, and natural resources. The governorates are also responsible for collecting taxes, managing local budgets, and implementing national policies at the local level.

Yemen has a relatively underdeveloped transportation network, with limited domestic flights, no trains, and few paved roads. The main modes of transportation are buses, taxis, and private cars. The road network is generally in poor condition, with many roads being unpaved or under construction. However, there are many bus companies that operate between major cities, offering a relatively affordable and convenient way to travel.

Domestic flights are available between major cities, such as Sanaa, Aden, and Taiz, but the frequency and reliability of flights can be limited. Taxis and private cars are widely available, but driving in Yemen can be challenging due to the poor road conditions and lack of traffic laws. [CALLOUT] It is recommended to exercise caution when driving in Yemen, especially at night or in rural areas.
