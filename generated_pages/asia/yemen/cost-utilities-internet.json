As a result, the quality of utility services can be inconsistent, with frequent power outages and water shortages reported in some areas. The cost of utilities in Yemen can also fluctuate due to seasonal variation, with higher demand for electricity and water during the hot summer months. In addition, the ongoing conflict in the country has led to shortages of fuel and other essential supplies, which can impact the stability of utility prices.\n\nThe cost of utilities in Yemen is also affected by the country's economic situation, with a large proportion of the population relying on **out-of-pocket** payments for healthcare and other essential services. According to the World Bank, out-of-pocket health expenditure in Yemen accounts for 69.1% of total health expenditure, which can put a significant burden on households. As a result, many people in Yemen have to prioritize their spending on essential utilities such as electricity, water, and gas, which can be a challenge given the fluctuating costs.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $30 | $50 | $70 | |\n| Water | $10 | $15 | $20 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $5 | $10 | $15 | (mostly used for cooking) |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $5 | $10 | $15 | (included in electricity or water bills in some areas) |\n| **Total** | **$50** | **$85** | **$120** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $20-30 | 10-20 Mbps | Yemen Net, TeleYemen |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $50-70 | 50-100 Mbps | Yemen Net, TeleYemen |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $5-10 | 1-5 GB | MTN, Sabafon |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $10-20 | 5-10 GB | MTN, Sabafon |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $30-50 | varies | TeleYemen, Yemen Net |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $8 | (available in some areas with good internet connectivity) |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | (available in some areas with good internet connectivity) |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (some local streaming services available, such as Yemen TV) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Yemen, it is recommended to contact the local utility providers, such as the **Ministry of Electricity and Energy**, or private companies like **Yemen Net** and **TeleYemen**.\n- Prepaid electricity meters are widely used in Yemen, which can help households to manage their energy consumption and avoid unexpected bills.\n- The best internet providers in Yemen are **Yemen Net** and **TeleYemen**, which offer a range of plans and services, including fiber internet and mobile data.\n- To save on utility bills, households can take measures such as using energy-efficient appliances, reducing water consumption, and switching to prepaid electricity meters.\n- It is also recommended to research and compare prices among different utility providers to find the best deals and services.",
