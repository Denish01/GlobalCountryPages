[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in Yemen is characterized by slow speeds and limited availability, with the average internet speed being around 2.5 Mbps download. This is largely due to the country's underdeveloped infrastructure and the ongoing conflict, which has damaged or destroyed many internet facilities. The urban-rural divide is also significant, with internet access being more readily available in cities like Sanaa and Aden, but scarce in rural areas. The reliability of the internet is also a concern, with frequent outages and disruptions to service.

Additionally, the ongoing conflict has led to a shortage of **qualified technicians** and **spare parts**, making it difficult to maintain and repair the existing infrastructure.
