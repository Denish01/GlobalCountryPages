  "content": "Yemen's infrastructure is underdeveloped and faces significant challenges due to years of conflict, lack of investment, and limited access to basic services such as electricity, water, and sanitation.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 55% of population\nInternet Penetration: 25%\nRoad Network: 71,300 km, poor quality due to lack of maintenance\nRail Network: none\nMajor Airports: 4\nMajor Ports: 4\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nYemen's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other countries in the region. The country has faced significant challenges in recent years, including a devastating civil war, which has led to a decline in the overall state of its infrastructure. Recent investments have been limited, and the urban-rural gap in terms of access to basic services is significant. In urban areas, access to electricity, water, and sanitation is generally better, but still faces frequent outages and disruptions. In rural areas, access to these basic services is often limited, and communities rely on traditional methods such as wells and generators for their daily needs.\n\nThe lack of investment in infrastructure has also had a significant impact on the country's economy. The limited access to electricity, water, and sanitation has hindered the growth of industries such as manufacturing and tourism, which are critical to the country's economic development. Furthermore, the poor state of the road network has made it difficult to transport goods and people, leading to higher costs and reduced economic activity.\n\nDespite these challenges, there are efforts underway to improve the state of Yemen's infrastructure. International organizations and donor countries have provided funding for various infrastructure projects, including the rehabilitation of roads, the expansion of electricity generation, and the improvement of water and sanitation services. However, more needs to be done to address the significant infrastructure gaps in the country.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 71,300 km | Poor | Limited maintenance, frequent potholes and damage |\n| Railways | none | - | No rail network in Yemen |\n| Airports | 4 international, 10 domestic | Moderate | Limited facilities and services, with some airports damaged during conflict |\n| Ports | 4 major | Moderate | Limited capacity and facilities, with some ports damaged during conflict |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- Yemen's **power generation** is primarily based on **fossil fuels**, with a limited capacity to generate electricity.\n- The country faces frequent **power outages**, with some areas experiencing outages for up to 20 hours a day.\n- **Renewable energy** sources, such as solar and wind power, are being explored, but their contribution to the overall energy mix is still limited.\n- The **reliability of the electricity grid** is a major concern, with frequent disruptions and outages affecting businesses and households.\n- **Energy efficiency** is also a challenge, with many buildings and homes using inefficient appliances and lighting systems.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water safety** is a concern in Yemen, with many areas lacking access to safe and clean drinking water.\n- **Sanitation coverage** is also limited, with many households lacking access to proper sanitation facilities.\n- **Water access** in rural areas is a significant challenge, with many communities relying on traditional wells and water sources.\n- **Water scarcity** is a major issue, with the country facing significant challenges in meeting the demand for water, particularly during periods of drought.\n- **Wastewater management** is also a concern, with many areas lacking proper wastewater treatment and disposal facilities.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is relatively widespread in Yemen, with most areas having access to mobile phone services.\n- **Fiber and broadband** services are limited, with few areas having access to high-speed internet.\n- **4G and 5G rollout** is still in its infancy, with few areas having access to these services.\n- **Postal services** are limited, with few areas having access to reliable and efficient postal services.\n- **Internet penetration** is relatively low, with only a quarter of the population having access to the internet.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The **Sana'a Water Supply Project** aims to improve access to safe and clean drinking water in the capital city.\n- The **Aden Port Development Project** aims to expand and modernize the port facilities, increasing the country's capacity to handle cargo and trade.\n- The **Yemen Energy Access Project** aims to improve access to electricity in rural areas, using renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power.\n- The **Transport Sector Development Project** aims to improve the country's road network, including the rehabilitation of key roads and the construction of new ones.\n- The **Telecommunications Sector Development Project** aims to improve the country's telecommunications infrastructure, including the expansion of mobile and internet services.",
