[SECTION] Cost of Living Overview [/SECTION]
Yemen is considered one of the least expensive countries in the Middle East, with a low cost of living compared to its neighbors, Saudi Arabia and Oman. The GDP per capita (PPP) of $2,380 (2020) provides a rough anchor for estimating living costs. A budget lifestyle in Yemen can go a long way, with $200-300 per month covering basic expenses such as rent, food, and transportation. However, this lifestyle would require significant compromises, such as sharing a small apartment outside the city center and cooking most meals at home. In contrast, a mid-range lifestyle with $500-700 per month would provide more comfort and flexibility, including a one-bedroom apartment in the city center and the ability to eat out occasionally.

The cost of living in Yemen is relatively low compared to other countries in the region, but it is still important to be mindful of expenses, especially when it comes to healthcare and transportation. The out-of-pocket health spend is 69.1% (2023), which means that individuals may need to pay a significant portion of their medical expenses out of pocket. Additionally, transportation costs can add up quickly, especially if you plan to travel outside the city. Overall, Yemen can be a great value for those who are willing to adapt to a simple and traditional way of life, but it may not be the best fit for those who require a high level of comfort and convenience.
