# The Truth About Yemen - History & Real Facts

Yemen, a country with a rich history and diverse culture, is often misunderstood due to a lack of accurate information and perpetuated misconceptions.

[SECTION] Historical Context [/SECTION]
Yemen has a long and complex history, with the first known settlements dating back to the 3rd millennium BC. The region was part of the ancient Sabaean Kingdom, which was founded around 1500 BC and was known for its advanced irrigation systems and trade networks. In the 7th century AD, Yemen was conquered by the Arabs and became a major center of Islamic learning and culture. The country was later divided into several smaller states, including the Zaidi imamate in the north and the Aden colony in the south, which was under British control from 1839 to 1967. Yemen gained its independence from the United Kingdom on November 30, 1967, and the two separate states, North Yemen and South Yemen, were unified on May 22, 1990.

The country's strategic location at the southern entrance of the Red Sea has made it an important hub for trade and commerce throughout history. Yemen's unique cultural heritage is reflected in its architecture, art, and literature, which have been influenced by various civilizations, including the ancient Sabaeans, the Arabs, and the Ottomans. The country's history is also marked by periods of conflict, including the civil war that lasted from 1962 to 1970 and the ongoing conflict that began in 2015.

Yemen's classification as a **sovereign** state is based on its independence and self-governance, with a presidential system and a multi-party parliament. The country is a member of various international organizations, including the United Nations, the Arab League, and the Gulf Cooperation Council. Yemen's **continent** is Asia, and its **capital** is Sanaa, which is also the largest city in the country.

Yemen's **population** is approximately 32.7 million people, with a diverse range of ethnic and linguistic groups. The official language is **Arabic**, and the **currency** is the Yemeni rial (YER). The country's **neighbors** are Saudi Arabia to the north and Oman to the east, with the Red Sea to the west and the Gulf of Aden to the south.
