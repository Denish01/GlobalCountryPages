Both countries have faced significant economic challenges in recent years, including conflict, poverty, and lack of infrastructure. However, Yemen is generally considered to be cheaper than Somalia, with a lower cost of living and more affordable prices for basic necessities like food, housing, and transportation. The economic context of both countries is complex, with Yemen's economy heavily reliant on oil exports and Somalia's economy struggling to recover from decades of conflict and instability.\n\nThe cost of living in Yemen is lower than in Somalia, with prices for everyday items like food, housing, and transportation generally 20-30% cheaper. This is due in part to Yemen's larger economy and more developed infrastructure, which allows for greater competition and lower prices. Additionally, Yemen's currency, the Yemeni rial, has been relatively stable in recent years, which has helped to keep prices low. In contrast, Somalia's economy is still recovering from decades of conflict and instability, and prices for basic necessities are often higher due to a lack of infrastructure and competition.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Yemen (USD) | Somalia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 150 | 250 | 40% cheaper |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 100 | 180 | 44% cheaper |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 300 | 500 | 40% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Yemen (USD) | Somalia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 5 | 8 | 37% cheaper |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 100 | 150 | 33% cheaper |\n| Beer (500ml) | 3 | 5 | 40% cheaper |\n| Coffee | 1 | 2 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Yemen (USD) | Somalia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 20 | 30 | 33% cheaper |\n| Taxi (per km) | 0.50 | 1.00 | 50% cheaper |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 0.50 | 0.70 | 29% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Yemen (USD) | Somalia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 50 | 80 | 37% cheaper |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 30 | 50 | 40% cheaper |\n| Mobile Plan | 10 | 20 | 50% cheaper |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Yemen (USD) | Somalia (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 400 | 600 | 33% |\n| Mid-Range | 800 | 1,200 | 33% |\n| Comfortable | 1,200 | 1,800 | 33% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Yemen is cheaper for:**\n- Rent and housing, with prices 40-50% lower than in Somalia\n- Food and dining, with meals and groceries 30-50% cheaper\n- Transportation, with taxis and fuel 30-50% cheaper\n- Utilities and internet, with prices 30-50% lower\n- **Somalia is cheaper for:**\n- Certain types of clothing and textiles, which can be 10-20% cheaper in Somalia\n- Traditional handicrafts and souvenirs, which can be 10-20% cheaper in Somalia\n- Certain types of electronics, which can be 5-10% cheaper in Somalia\n- Mobile phone plans, which can be 10-20% cheaper in Somalia\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nYemen is generally the better value for expats, students, and retirees, with a lower cost of living and more affordable prices for basic necessities.
