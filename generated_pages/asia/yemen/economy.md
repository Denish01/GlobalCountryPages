[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Yemen is a low-income economy, with a GDP per capita of less than $1,000. The country has been facing significant development challenges, including a large population, limited natural resources, and a lack of infrastructure. The economy has been heavily reliant on oil and gas exports, which have been declining in recent years due to depletion of reserves and conflict. Yemen's economic classification is a lower-middle-income economy, but it has been downgraded to a low-income economy due to the ongoing conflict and humanitarian crisis.

The country's economic development level is relatively low, with a human development index (HDI) ranking of 179 out of 189 countries. The economy has been growing slowly, with a growth rate of around 2-3% per annum, but this growth has been uneven and has not been able to keep pace with the growing population. The trajectory of the economy is uncertain, with the ongoing conflict and humanitarian crisis posing significant challenges to economic development.

Yemen's economy is also heavily reliant on remittances from migrant workers, with many Yemenis working in other countries in the region, such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The country is also vulnerable to external shocks, such as changes in global oil prices, which can have a significant impact on the economy.
