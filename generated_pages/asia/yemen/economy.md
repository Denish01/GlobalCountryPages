[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Yemen's economy has been severely impacted by the ongoing civil war, which has resulted in significant damage to the country's infrastructure, institutions, and human capital. The economy is classified as a lower-middle-income economy, with a GDP per capita of around $706. The country's economic development has been hindered by various challenges, including a lack of economic diversification, corruption, and a significant dependence on foreign aid. Despite these challenges, the government has implemented various reforms aimed at promoting economic growth and development, including the privatization of state-owned enterprises and the liberalization of trade policies.

The country's economic trajectory has been volatile, with periods of high growth followed by periods of decline. The economy has been heavily reliant on the oil and gas sector, which has been affected by fluctuations in global energy prices. The services sector, including telecommunications and finance, has also played a significant role in the economy. However, the sector has been impacted by the ongoing conflict, which has disrupted the provision of basic services such as electricity and water.

The government has recognized the need to diversify the economy and has implemented various initiatives aimed at promoting non-oil sectors, including agriculture, manufacturing, and tourism. However, these efforts have been hindered by the ongoing conflict, which has made it difficult to attract foreign investment and promote economic growth.
