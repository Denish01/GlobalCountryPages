[SECTION] How Tajikistan Is Divided [/SECTION]
Tajikistan is a sovereign country located in Asia, and its administrative structure is divided into four provinces, known as viloyats, and the capital city of Dushanbe. The provinces are further divided into districts, known as nohiya, which are then subdivided into jamoats, or rural communities. This administrative structure allows for effective governance and management of the country's resources and population. The four provinces are Sughd, Khatlon, Khorugh, and the Districts of Republican Subordination, each with its own unique character and attractions.

The country's administrative divisions are designed to balance the needs of the population with the country's natural resources and economic development. The provinces are responsible for managing local affairs, such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure development, while the central government is responsible for national policies and decision-making. This system allows for a degree of autonomy and flexibility in governance, which is essential for a country with a diverse geography and economy.
