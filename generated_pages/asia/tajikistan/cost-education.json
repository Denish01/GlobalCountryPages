Compulsory education in Tajikistan lasts for 11 years, from age 7 to 18, and is divided into primary, secondary, and higher education levels. International schools are available in major cities like Dushanbe, but they are relatively rare and often cater to expatriate families or wealthy locals.\n\nThe quality of education in public schools can be inconsistent, with some schools lacking resources and qualified teachers.
