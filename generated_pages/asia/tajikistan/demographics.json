The population growth rate is approximately 2.3%, which is one of the highest in the region. The country's urban population is around 27%, with the majority of people living in rural areas. However, urbanization is on the rise, with many young people moving to cities in search of better job opportunities and education. Migration patterns in Tajikistan are also significant, with many people traveling to Russia and other neighboring countries for work. According to estimates, around 1 million Tajik citizens are living and working abroad, mostly in Russia.\n\nThe population of Tajikistan is also characterized by a high fertility rate, with an average of 3.8 children per woman. This has contributed to the country's high population growth rate and has also put pressure on the country's resources and infrastructure. The median age in Tajikistan is around 22.5 years, making it one of the youngest populations in the region. This demographic trend has significant implications for the country's economy, education system, and healthcare services.\n\nIn terms of population density, Tajikistan has a relatively low density of 73 people per square kilometer. However, the population is not evenly distributed, with the majority of people living in the western and central regions of the country. The eastern region, known as the Pamir Mountains, is more sparsely populated due to its rugged terrain and harsh climate.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Tajik | 84.3% | Throughout the country | Dominant ethnic group |\n| Uzbek | 12.2% | Sughd Province | Significant minority |\n| Pamiri | 2.3% | Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region | Indigenous group |\n| Kyrgyz | 0.8% | Eastern regions | Minority group |\n| Russian | 0.5% | Urban areas | Minority group |\n| Other | 0.9% | Throughout the country | Includes other minority groups |\n[/TABLE]\nThe ethnic diversity of Tajikistan is an important aspect of the country's cultural identity.
