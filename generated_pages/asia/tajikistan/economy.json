  "content": "Tajikistan's economy is a developing, lower-middle-income economy that is driven primarily by agriculture, remittances, and foreign investment in the mining and manufacturing sectors. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nGDP (nominal): ($8 billion estimate)\nGDP Per Capita: ($800 estimate)\nIncome Classification: (Lower-Middle)\nMain Industries: (aluminum, cotton, textiles)\nCurrency: TJS\nUnemployment Rate: (approximately 30%)\nEase of Doing Business: (ranked 106 out of 190 countries)\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]\nTajikistan's economy is characterized as a lower-middle-income economy, with a GDP per capita of around $800. The country has made significant progress in recent years, with the economy growing at an average rate of 7% per annum from 2000 to 2018. However, the economy remains vulnerable to external shocks, including fluctuations in global commodity prices and weather-related events that impact agricultural production. The government has implemented various reforms aimed at diversifying the economy, improving the business climate, and increasing foreign investment.\n\nThe country's economic development is also hindered by its landlocked location, limited infrastructure, and lack of access to international markets. Additionally, Tajikistan's economy is heavily reliant on remittances from migrant workers, primarily in Russia, which can be a volatile source of income. The government has recognized the need to reduce its dependence on remittances and is working to promote private sector growth and investment in key sectors such as mining, manufacturing, and tourism.\n\nTajikistan's economic classification as a lower-middle-income economy reflects its progress in reducing poverty and improving living standards. However, the country still faces significant development challenges, including a lack of economic diversification, limited access to finance, and a shortage of skilled workers. The government has set ambitious targets for economic growth and development, including becoming an upper-middle-income country by 2030.\n\n[SECTION] Key Industries [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Industry | Contribution | Details |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Agriculture | 20% of GDP | Cotton, wheat, and fruits are the main crops, with agriculture providing employment for around 40% of the workforce |\n| Mining | 10% of GDP | Tajikistan has significant deposits of minerals, including aluminum, gold, and silver, with the aluminum industry being a major contributor to the country's exports |\n| Manufacturing | 15% of GDP | The manufacturing sector is primarily focused on textiles, food processing, and construction materials, with many factories located in the capital city of Dushanbe |\n| Services | 40% of GDP | The services sector is the largest contributor to the economy, with many Tajikistanis working in the retail, hospitality, and finance sectors |\n| Construction | 5% of GDP | The construction sector has experienced significant growth in recent years, driven by large-scale infrastructure projects, including the construction of new roads, bridges, and buildings |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Trade Profile [/SECTION]\n**Top Exports:** \n- Aluminum: Tajikistan is one of the world's largest producers of aluminum, with the majority of its exports going to countries such as Russia, China, and Turkey.\n- Cotton: Cotton is another major export, with Tajikistan producing high-quality cotton that is in demand from textile manufacturers around the world.\n- Textiles: The textile industry is a significant contributor to the country's exports, with many factories producing clothing and other textile products for both domestic and international markets.\n- Fruits and Vegetables: Tajikistan is known for its high-quality fruits and vegetables, including apples, apricots, and grapes, which are exported to countries such as Russia, Kazakhstan, and China.\n- Minerals: Tajikistan has significant deposits of minerals, including gold, silver, and copper, which are exported to countries around the world.\n\n**Top Imports:** \n- Machinery and Equipment: Tajikistan imports a significant amount of machinery and equipment, primarily from countries such as China, Russia, and the United States.\n- Fuel: The country is heavily reliant on imports of fuel, including gasoline, diesel, and natural gas, which are used to power its economy.\n- Food: Tajikistan imports a significant amount of food, including wheat, rice, and meat, which are used to meet domestic demand.\n- Construction Materials: The country imports a range of construction materials, including cement, steel, and glass, which are used in the construction sector.\n- Electronics: Tajikistan imports a significant amount of electronic goods, including computers, smartphones, and televisions, which are in high demand from consumers.\n\n**Key Trading Partners:** \n- China: China is one of Tajikistan's largest trading partners, with the two countries having a significant trade relationship that includes the import and export of goods such as machinery, electronics, and textiles.\n- Russia: Russia is another key trading partner, with Tajikistan importing a significant amount of fuel, machinery, and equipment from the country.\n- Kazakhstan: Kazakhstan is a significant trading partner, with the two countries having a long-standing trade relationship that includes the import and export of goods such as fuel, food, and construction materials.\n- Uzbekistan: Uzbekistan is also an important trading partner, with the two countries trading goods such as cotton, textiles, and machinery.\n- Turkey: Turkey is a significant trading partner, with Tajikistan importing a range of goods, including textiles, machinery, and electronics.\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n- The transport network in Tajikistan is limited, with many roads in poor condition and limited access to international markets.\n- The country has a significant shortage of energy, with many households and businesses relying on imported fuel to meet their energy needs.\n- Internet and mobile penetration is limited, with around 20% of the population having access to the internet and around 30% having a mobile phone.\n- The country has several ports and airports, including the Dushanbe International Airport, which provides access to international markets.\n- The government has invested heavily in the development of the country's infrastructure, including the construction of new roads, bridges, and energy facilities.\n\n[SECTION] Economic Outlook [/SECTION]\nTajikistan's economic outlook is positive, with the government implementing a range of reforms aimed at promoting private sector growth and investment.
