[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
The education system in Tajikistan is divided into public and private institutions, with the public system being the largest and most accessible. Public schools in Tajikistan are generally free or subsidized, but the quality of education can vary depending on the location and resources available. The language of instruction is primarily **Tajik**, but some schools may also offer instruction in **Russian** or **English**. Compulsory education in Tajikistan lasts for 11 years, from age 7 to 18, and is divided into primary, secondary, and higher education levels. International schools are available in major cities like Dushanbe, but they are relatively rare and often cater to expatriate families or wealthy locals.

The quality of education in public schools can be inconsistent, with some schools lacking resources and qualified teachers. Private schools, on the other hand, often have better facilities and more experienced teachers, but they can be expensive and out of reach for many families. International schools in Tajikistan offer a range of curricula, including the **International Baccalaureate** and **Cambridge International Examinations**, and are often preferred by expatriate families due to their high standards and English-language instruction.
