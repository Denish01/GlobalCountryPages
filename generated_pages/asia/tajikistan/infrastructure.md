# Tajikistan Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

The infrastructure in Tajikistan is characterized by a mix of modern and outdated systems, with significant development gaps between urban and rural areas, particularly in terms of access to electricity, clean water, and reliable transportation. 

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 98.5% of population
Internet Penetration: 20.5%
Road Network: 13,700 km, moderate quality with some paved highways
Rail Network: 680 km
Major Airports: 4
Major Ports: 0, landlocked
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Tajikistan's infrastructure development level is relatively low compared to other countries in the region, with significant investments needed to upgrade and expand its transportation, energy, and water systems. Recent investments have focused on improving the country's road network, with the construction of new highways and the rehabilitation of existing ones. However, the urban-rural gap remains a major challenge, with many rural areas lacking access to basic infrastructure services such as electricity, clean water, and sanitation. The government has launched several initiatives to address these disparities, including the development of rural infrastructure and the promotion of private sector investment in the sector.

Despite these challenges, Tajikistan has made significant progress in recent years in terms of infrastructure development, with the support of international organizations and donors. The country has also made efforts to improve its business environment and attract foreign investment, which is expected to have a positive impact on the development of its infrastructure sector. However, more needs to be done to address the significant infrastructure gaps that exist, particularly in rural areas.

The government's development strategy prioritizes the development of the country's infrastructure, with a focus on transportation, energy, and water systems. The strategy also emphasizes the importance of private sector participation and investment in the sector, as well as the need to improve the regulatory framework and business environment.
