The country's GDP per capita (PPP) of $5,406 indicates a relatively low standard of living, but this also means that expenses are generally lower. A budget of $250-350 per month can go a long way in covering basic expenses, including rent, food, and transportation, while a mid-range lifestyle of $500-700 per month can provide more comfort and flexibility. In comparison to neighboring countries, Tajikistan is more affordable than Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, but slightly more expensive than Afghanistan.\n\nThe affordability of Tajikistan is largely due to its low cost of living, which is influenced by the country's relatively low economic development. However, this also means that some modern amenities and services may be limited, particularly outside of the capital city Dushanbe. For example, internet speeds can be slow, and the availability of international cuisine is limited. Nevertheless, Tajikistan offers a unique cultural experience and breathtaking natural beauty, making it an attractive destination for travelers and expats.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Breakdown [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Category | Budget ($) | Mid-Range ($) | Comfortable ($) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rent (1BR apartment) | 50-100 | 150-250 | 300-500 | (budget=shared/outside, mid=1BR center, comfortable=nice 2BR) |\n| Food & Groceries | 50-100 | 100-200 | 200-300 | (budget=cook mostly, mid=mix, comfortable=eat out often) |\n| Transportation | 10-20 | 20-50 | 50-100 | (budget=public only, mid=mix, comfortable=taxi/car) |\n| Utilities & Internet | 20-50 | 50-100 | 100-150 | (electricity, water, internet, phone) |\n| Healthcare / Insurance | 10-20 | 20-50 | 50-100 | (budget=public only, comfortable=private) |\n| Entertainment & Social | 20-50 | 50-100 | 100-200 | (going out, hobbies, gym) |\n| Clothing & Personal | 10-20 | 20-50 | 50-100 | |\n| Savings / Misc | 50-100 | 100-200 | 200-300 | |\n| **Total** | **250-350** | **500-700** | **1,000-1,500** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Budget Tier Lifestyles [/SECTION]\nA budget lifestyle of $250-350 per month in Tajikistan means living modestly, with some compromises on comfort and convenience.
