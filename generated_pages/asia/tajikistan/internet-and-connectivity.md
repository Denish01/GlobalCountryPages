[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in Tajikistan is not as developed as in other parts of the world, with an average internet speed of 5 Mbps download. The country's mountainous terrain and limited infrastructure make it difficult to provide reliable and fast internet connections, especially in rural areas. In urban areas like Dushanbe, the capital city, internet speeds are generally faster, but still not as fast as what you might be used to in other countries. The urban-rural divide is significant, with many rural areas having limited or no internet access at all.

The reliability of the internet in Tajikistan can also be a issue, with frequent outages and slow speeds. This can be frustrating for travelers and remote workers who need to stay connected. However, the situation is improving, with the government investing in new infrastructure and internet service providers (ISPs) expanding their coverage. Despite the challenges, it is still possible to stay connected in Tajikistan, especially with the help of mobile networks and WiFi hotspots.

[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]
To get a SIM card in Tajikistan, you can visit one of the main carriers' offices, such as MegaFon, Beeline, or Tcell. You will need to provide your passport and register your SIM card, which can take a few minutes. The cost of a tourist SIM card is around 10 USD, and you can top up your credit at many shops and kiosks around the country. It's recommended to buy a SIM card from a official carrier's office, as this will ensure that you get a reliable and legitimate service.

The main carriers in Tajikistan offer a range of data plans, including tourist-friendly options.
