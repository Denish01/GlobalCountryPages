However, the market is growing, with new constructions and renovations of old buildings, offering a range of options for expats and locals alike. Typical lease terms are for one year, with a deposit of one to two months' rent required. Tenant rights are not well-established, and disputes are often resolved through informal negotiations. Compared to its regional neighbors, such as Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, Tajikistan's housing costs are relatively low, making it an attractive option for expats and investors.\n\nThe housing market in Tajikistan is also influenced by the country's economic conditions, with a significant portion of the population living in rural areas and relying on traditional housing. However, the government has been investing in infrastructure development, including housing, which is expected to drive growth in the sector. Additionally, the country's **GDP per capita** has been steadily increasing, which is likely to lead to higher demand for modern housing and increased investment in the sector.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $100-150 | $30-50 | basic amenities, shared kitchen and bathroom |\n| 1 Bedroom | $150-200 | $50-100 | modern amenities, private kitchen and bathroom |\n| 2 Bedroom | $250-350 | $100-200 | spacious, modern amenities, private kitchen and bathroom |\n| 3 Bedroom | $400-500 | $200-300 | luxurious, modern amenities, private kitchen and bathroom |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $500-800 | prime locations, modern amenities |\n| Suburbs | $200-400 | residential areas, basic amenities |\n| Rural | $50-100 | traditional housing, limited amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Shohmansur**: a modern neighborhood with high-rise buildings, shopping centers, and restaurants, rent range $150-300 per month\n- **Somonien**: a historic neighborhood with traditional houses, narrow streets, and a lively market, rent range $100-200 per month\n- **Firdavsi**: a residential neighborhood with a mix of old and new buildings, amenities, and services, rent range $50-150 per month\n- **Zainabobod**: a suburban neighborhood with modern houses, gardens, and a peaceful atmosphere, rent range $30-100 per month\n- **Isfara**: a historic neighborhood with traditional houses, narrow streets, and a lively market, rent range $50-150 per month\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Tajikistan [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods and prices before starting your search to find the best options for your budget\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent or **property manager** to find a suitable apartment or house\n- Inspect the property carefully before signing a lease to ensure it is in good condition\n- Negotiate the rent and lease terms to get the best deal\n- Be prepared to pay a deposit and first month's rent in advance\n- Check if utilities such as **electricity**, **water**, and **gas** are included in the rent or not\n- Consider purchasing **furniture** and **appliances** separately, as unfurnished apartments are common in Tajikistan",
