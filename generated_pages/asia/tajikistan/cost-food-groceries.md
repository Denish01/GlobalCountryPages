[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Food prices in Tajikistan are generally lower compared to other countries in the region, with a meal at a local eatery or street food stall costing around $1-3 USD. The cost of food is driven by factors such as the country's **agricultural sector**, which is the mainstay of the economy, and the **importation of goods**, which can increase prices. Eating out is not as common in Tajikistan as it is in other countries, with many people preferring to **cook at home** using traditional ingredients and recipes. However, in recent years, there has been an increase in the number of restaurants and cafes, particularly in Dushanbe, offering a range of local and international cuisine.

The **eating-out culture** in Tajikistan is still developing, with many restaurants catering to locals and offering traditional dishes such as **plov**, **shashlik**, and **manti**. However, there are also a number of high-end restaurants and cafes that cater to tourists and expats, offering a range of international cuisine and drinks. The cost of eating out can vary greatly depending on the type of restaurant and the location, with high-end restaurants charging significantly more than local eateries.

[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]
The prices of groceries can vary significantly depending on whether you shop at a **supermarket** or a **local market**. Supermarkets tend to be more expensive, with prices around 10-20% higher than those at local markets. However, supermarkets often offer a wider range of products, including imported goods, and can be more convenient for shoppers. Local markets, on the other hand, offer a more traditional shopping experience, with vendors selling fresh produce, meats, and other goods. The prices at local markets can be lower, but the quality of the products may vary.

When shopping at local markets, it's common to **haggle** over prices, particularly for fresh produce and meats. Vendors will often quote a higher price than they are willing to accept, so it's worth bargaining to get a better deal. Supermarkets, on the other hand, tend to have fixed prices, so there is less room for negotiation. It's worth noting that some supermarkets may offer **discounts** or **promotions** on certain items, so it's worth checking the prices before making a purchase.
