[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Tajikistan's economy is characterized as a lower-middle-income economy, with a GDP per capita of around $800. The country has made significant progress in recent years, with the economy growing at an average rate of 7% per annum from 2000 to 2018. However, the economy remains vulnerable to external shocks, including fluctuations in global commodity prices and weather-related events that impact agricultural production. The government has implemented various reforms aimed at diversifying the economy, improving the business climate, and increasing foreign investment.

The country's economic development is also hindered by its landlocked location, limited infrastructure, and lack of access to international markets. Additionally, Tajikistan's economy is heavily reliant on remittances from migrant workers, primarily in Russia, which can be a volatile source of income. The government has recognized the need to reduce its dependence on remittances and is working to promote private sector growth and investment in key sectors such as mining, manufacturing, and tourism.

Tajikistan's economic classification as a lower-middle-income economy reflects its progress in reducing poverty and improving living standards. However, the country still faces significant development challenges, including a lack of economic diversification, limited access to finance, and a shortage of skilled workers. The government has set ambitious targets for economic growth and development, including becoming an upper-middle-income country by 2030.
