[SECTION] Tax System Overview [/SECTION]
Tajikistan has a **territorial taxation** system, where residents are taxed on their worldwide income, while non-residents are taxed only on their income derived from sources within Tajikistan. The residency rules for tax purposes in Tajikistan are based on the individual's physical presence in the country for at least 183 days in a calendar year. Individuals who are considered residents are required to file a tax return and report their worldwide income.

The tax system in Tajikistan is administered by the Tax Committee under the Government of Tajikistan, which is responsible for collecting taxes, enforcing tax laws, and providing tax services to taxpayers. The Tax Committee also provides guidance on tax matters and resolves tax disputes. The tax system is based on the Tax Code of Tajikistan, which was adopted in 2013 and has undergone several amendments since then.
