[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Tajikistan is relatively underdeveloped, with a limited supply of modern apartments and houses, particularly in the capital city Dushanbe. However, the market is growing, with new constructions and renovations of old buildings, offering a range of options for expats and locals alike. Typical lease terms are for one year, with a deposit of one to two months' rent required. Tenant rights are not well-established, and disputes are often resolved through informal negotiations. Compared to its regional neighbors, such as Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, Tajikistan's housing costs are relatively low, making it an attractive option for expats and investors.

The housing market in Tajikistan is also influenced by the country's economic conditions, with a significant portion of the population living in rural areas and relying on traditional housing. However, the government has been investing in infrastructure development, including housing, which is expected to drive growth in the sector. Additionally, the country's **GDP per capita** has been steadily increasing, which is likely to lead to higher demand for modern housing and increased investment in the sector.
