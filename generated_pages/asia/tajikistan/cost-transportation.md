[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Tajikistan has a relatively underdeveloped transportation system, with limited public transit options available in major cities like Dushanbe. The quality of public transit varies greatly between cities, with Dushanbe having a more comprehensive network of buses and minivans. Most people in Tajikistan rely on **private vehicles** or **taxis** to get around, especially in rural areas where public transportation is scarce. The country's mountainous terrain also makes it difficult to build and maintain roads, which can lead to higher transportation costs.

In recent years, the government has made efforts to improve the transportation infrastructure, including the construction of new roads and the introduction of **ride-hailing apps**. However, the availability and quality of these services can vary greatly depending on the location and time of day. Visitors to Tajikistan should be prepared for **bumpy roads** and **unpredictable traffic**, especially when traveling to rural areas.
