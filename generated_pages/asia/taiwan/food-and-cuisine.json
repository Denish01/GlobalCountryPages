The country's strategic location has made it a melting pot of culinary traditions, with Chinese immigrants bringing their own cooking techniques and ingredients, and Japanese colonial rule introducing new flavors and ingredients. Regional variations are also evident, with the north known for its beef noodle soup, the south for its seafood, and the east for its indigenous tribal cuisine.\n\nTaiwanese cuisine is also known for its **night markets**, which offer a wide range of street food and snacks, from oyster omelets to stinky tofu. These markets are a great place to try local specialties and experience the country's vibrant food culture. The cuisine is also characterized by its use of **seasonal ingredients**, with many dishes featuring fresh vegetables, fruits, and seafood.\n\nThe country's food culture is also shaped by its **cultural festivals**, which often feature traditional dishes and drinks. For example, the Lunar New Year is celebrated with traditional dishes like niangao (sticky rice cake) and fa gao (prosperity cake). The Mid-Autumn Festival is celebrated with mooncakes and tea, while the Dragon Boat Festival is marked with zongzi (glutinous rice dumplings) and realgar wine.\n\n[SECTION] Must-Try Dishes [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Dish | Type | Description | Where to Find |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Beef Noodle Soup | noodle soup | braised beef, noodles, and vegetables in a savory broth | Taipei, Taichung, Kaohsiung |\n| Stinky Tofu | street food | fermented tofu with a strong odor, often served deep-fried | Night markets, Taipei, Kaohsiung |\n| Oyster Omelet | street food | omelet filled with oysters, starch, and vegetables, often served with sauce | Night markets, Taipei, Tainan |\n| Gua Bao | sandwich | braised pork belly, pickled vegetables, and herbs on a steamed bun | Taipei, Taichung, Kaohsiung |\n| Bubble Tea | drink | tea drink with tapioca pearls, milk, and sugar | Cafes, Taipei, Taichung, Kaohsiung |\n| Ah-Ball | dessert | tangyuan (glutinous rice balls) in a sweet broth, often served with taro and sweet potato | Night markets, Taipei, Tainan |\n| Popcorn Chicken | street food | crispy fried chicken, often served with salt, pepper, and chili powder | Night markets, Taipei, Kaohsiung |\n| Mochi | dessert | glutinous rice cake filled with sweet fillings, such as red bean or peanut | Cafes, Taipei, Taichung, Kaohsiung |\n| Cong You Bing | pancake | savory pancake filled with scallions, often served with soy sauce and vinegar | Street food stalls, Taipei, Kaohsiung |\n| Ba Wan | snack | glutinous rice cake filled with meat, vegetables, and eggs, often served with sauce | Night markets, Taipei, Tainan |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Street Food & Snacks [/SECTION]\n- Stinky Tofu: fermented tofu with a strong odor, often served deep-fried ($3-5 USD)\n- Oyster Omelet: omelet filled with oysters, starch, and vegetables, often served with sauce ($5-7 USD)\n- Popcorn Chicken: crispy fried chicken, often served with salt, pepper, and chili powder ($5-7 USD)\n- Gua Bao: braised pork belly, pickled vegetables, and herbs on a steamed bun ($3-5 USD)\n- Ah-Ball: tangyuan (glutinous rice balls) in a sweet broth, often served with taro and sweet potato ($3-5 USD)\n- Fried Chicken Cutlet: breaded and fried chicken cutlet, often served with salt, pepper, and chili powder ($5-7 USD)\n- Scallion Pancake: savory pancake filled with scallions, often served with soy sauce and vinegar ($3-5 USD)\n- Taro Ball: deep-fried taro ball, often served with sugar and soy sauce ($3-5 USD)\n\n[SECTION] Drinks [/SECTION]\n- Bubble Tea: tea drink with tapioca pearls, milk, and sugar ($3-5 USD)\n- Taiwanese Beer: local beer, such as Taiwan Beer or Gold Medal Beer ($5-7 USD)\n- Oolong Tea: partially fermented tea, often served hot or iced ($3-5 USD)\n- Jasmine Tea: scented tea, often served hot or iced ($3-5 USD)\n- Fresh Juice: fresh juice made with local fruits, such as watermelon or orange ($5-7 USD)\n- Soy Milk: soy milk, often served hot or iced ($3-5 USD)\n\n[SECTION] Dining Customs [/SECTION]\n- Table manners: use chopsticks to eat, and wait for the host to start eating before you begin\n- Tipping: not expected, but 10% is appreciated for exceptional service\n- Reservations: not always necessary, but recommended for popular restaurants\n- Dress code: casual, but dress modestly when visiting temples or traditional restaurants\n- Eating etiquette: try a little of each dish, and don't finish a meal completely, as it implies the host did not provide enough food\n- Gift-giving: bring a small gift, such as fruit or chocolates, when visiting a Taiwanese home for dinner\n\n[SECTION] Where to Eat [/SECTION]\n- Night markets: try street food and snacks, such as stinky tofu and oyster omelets\n- Restaurants: try traditional Taiwanese cuisine, such as beef noodle soup and gua bao\n- Food courts: try a variety of dishes, including Taiwanese, Chinese, and Japanese cuisine\n- Cafes: try bubble tea and other desserts, such as mochi and tangyuan\n- Street food stalls: try popular snacks, such as popcorn chicken and scallion pancakes\n\n[SECTION] Food Markets & Food Experiences [/SECTION]\n- Shilin Night Market (Taipei): try street food and snacks, such as stinky tofu and oyster omelets\n- Raohe Street Night Market (Kaohsiung): try street food and snacks, such as popcorn chicken and scallion pancakes\n- Jianguo Flower Market (Taipei): try traditional Taiwanese desserts, such as tangyuan and mochi\n- Tainan Flower Night Market (Tainan): try street food and snacks, such as ah-ball and taro ball\n- Ningxia Night Market (Taipei): try traditional Taiwanese cuisine, such as beef noodle soup and gua bao",
