[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Taiwan's **universal healthcare system** provides comprehensive coverage to all citizens, with both public and private healthcare options available. The system is generally considered to be of high quality, with well-trained medical professionals and modern facilities. For locals, the system is relatively straightforward, with most medical expenses covered by the national health insurance program. However, for foreigners, the system can be more complex, and it is generally recommended that they purchase private health insurance to cover any medical expenses.

The quality of public and private healthcare in Taiwan is generally high, with many medical facilities and professionals meeting international standards. However, private healthcare options tend to offer more luxurious amenities and shorter wait times, while public options can be more crowded and have longer wait times. It is worth noting that many medical professionals in Taiwan speak some English, but it is still a good idea for foreigners to learn some basic Mandarin phrases to help navigate the healthcare system.

[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]
- Prescription medication can be purchased at pharmacies with a valid prescription, with costs ranging from $5 to $20 for basic medications.
- Over-the-counter medications are widely available at pharmacies and convenience stores, with costs ranging from $2 to $10.
- Some medications, such as painkillers and antibiotics, may require a prescription from a doctor.
- Pharmacies are widely available in urban areas, but may be less common in rural areas.
- Many pharmacies offer delivery services, especially in urban areas.
- Some medications may be more expensive in Taiwan than in other countries, so it is a good idea to check prices before purchasing.

[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]
In the event of a medical emergency, it is best to call the local emergency number, 119, for assistance. Ambulances are widely available and can transport patients to the nearest hospital. For foreigners, it is recommended to visit one of the major hospitals in Taipei, such as the National Taiwan University Hospital or the Taipei Veterans General Hospital, which offer high-quality care and have English-speaking staff. It is also a good idea to have a basic understanding of Mandarin, as not all medical staff may speak English fluently.

For non-emergency medical situations, it is generally best to visit a clinic or hospital during regular business hours, when wait times are typically shorter. Many hospitals and clinics also offer online appointment systems, which can help reduce wait times. It is also a good idea to have a copy of your medical records and any relevant test results, as this can help medical professionals provide more effective care. Additionally, it is a good idea to have a list of important phone numbers, such as your insurance provider and embassy, in case of an emergency.
