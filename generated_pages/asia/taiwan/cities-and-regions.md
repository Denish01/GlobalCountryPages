[SECTION] How Taiwan Is Divided [/SECTION]
Taiwan is divided into a multi-level administrative system, with the central government overseeing six special municipalities, three provincial cities, and thirteen counties. The six special municipalities, which include Taipei, New Taipei City, Taoyuan, Taichung, Tainan, and Kaohsiung, are governed directly by the central government and have a higher degree of autonomy than the counties and provincial cities. The counties and provincial cities are further divided into districts, towns, and townships, each with their own local government and administration.

The administrative divisions of Taiwan are designed to provide a framework for governance, economic development, and public services, with each level of government having its own responsibilities and powers. The system has evolved over time, with the most recent changes being the creation of the six special municipalities in 2010, which aimed to promote economic growth, improve public services, and enhance the overall quality of life for citizens.
