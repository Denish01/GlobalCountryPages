  "content": "The cost of education in Taiwan varies depending on the type of institution and the level of study, with public schools being generally free or subsidized, while private schools and international schools can range from a few thousand to over $10,000 per year.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nEducation Spend (% GDP): 6.4\nLiteracy Rate: 95.7%\nSchool System: 12 years of compulsory education\nAcademic Year: 12 months\nCurrency: TWD\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]\nTaiwan's education system is highly regarded, with a strong emphasis on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. Public education is generally of high quality and is free or heavily subsidized, making it an attractive option for locals and expats alike. However, the language of instruction is primarily Mandarin, which can be a barrier for international students who do not speak the language. Compulsory education in Taiwan lasts for 12 years, from age 6 to 18, and includes primary, junior high, and senior high school. International schools are also available, offering a range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate (IB) and the American curriculum.\n\nPrivate education in Taiwan is also of high quality, with many private schools offering a range of extracurricular activities and facilities. However, the cost of private education can be prohibitively expensive, with some top-tier private schools charging over $10,000 per year. International schools, on the other hand, offer a more diverse range of curricula and are often favored by expat families. However, the cost of international schools can be even higher, with some schools charging over $20,000 per year.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 (free) | High-quality education, with a focus on Mandarin and core subjects |\n| Private Primary | $2,000-$5,000 | Range of quality and facilities, with some top-tier schools offering excellent extracurricular activities |\n| Public Secondary | $0 (free) | Continued emphasis on STEM fields, with a range of elective courses available |\n| Private Secondary | $3,000-$8,000 | Higher quality facilities and teaching, with some schools offering international curricula |\n| International School | $8,000-$20,000 | Range of curricula, including IB and American, with excellent facilities and extracurricular activities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $1,500-$3,000 | $2,500-$5,000 | High-quality education, with a range of programs available |\n| Private University | $3,000-$6,000 | $5,000-$10,000 | Higher quality facilities and teaching, with some top-tier universities offering excellent research opportunities |\n| Top-Ranked University | $2,000-$4,000 | $4,000-$8,000 | National Taiwan University is a top-ranked university, offering a range of programs and research opportunities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $200-$500 | Range of quality and facilities, with some top-tier schools offering excellent care and education |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $20-$50 | Range of subjects and quality, with some top-tier tutors offering excellent support |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $100-$300 | Range of languages and quality, with some top-tier schools offering excellent instruction |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $100-$300 | Range of quality and cost, with some top-tier schools requiring more expensive supplies |\n| School Uniform | $50-$100 | Range of quality and cost, with some top-tier schools requiring more expensive uniforms |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The education system in Taiwan is highly competitive, with a strong emphasis on STEM fields and a range of extracurricular activities available.\n- Expats may find that international schools offer the best option for their children, with a range of curricula and excellent facilities available.\n- Scholarships are available for international students, with some top-tier universities offering excellent support and funding.\n- Online learning options are also available, with some top-tier universities offering a range of programs and courses.\n- Education quality in Taiwan is generally high, with a strong emphasis on teacher training and school facilities.\n- [CALLOUT] It's worth noting that the education system in Taiwan can be highly competitive, and students may face significant pressure to perform well, particularly in the senior high school years.",
