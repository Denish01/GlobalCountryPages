[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Taiwan has a moderate visa policy, with a mix of visa-free access, visa on arrival, and required visas for different nationalities. Citizens of around 90 countries can enter Taiwan visa-free, with varying lengths of stay, while others may need to apply for a visa in advance or obtain one on arrival. The visa policy is designed to balance the need to facilitate international travel and trade with the need to maintain national security and control over immigration.

The visa-free access policy is generally liberal for citizens of developed countries, with stays ranging from 30 to 90 days, while citizens of other countries may need to apply for a visa in advance or obtain a special permit. The Taiwanese government regularly reviews and updates its visa policy to reflect changing international circumstances and to promote tourism, business, and cultural exchange.
