Taoyuan International Airport is the larger of the two and is located about 30 kilometers west of Taipei, the capital city. Direct flights to Taiwan are available from major hubs in Asia, Europe, and North America, including Tokyo, Seoul, Hong Kong, and Los Angeles. Overland entry points to Taiwan are limited, as the country is an island, but it is possible to take a ferry from China or Japan.\n\nFor travelers who prefer to arrive by sea, there are several ports in Taiwan that offer ferry services from neighboring countries. The most common overland entry point is the port city of Kaohsiung, which receives ferries from China and the Philippines. However, it is essential to note that these services may be subject to change, and it is always best to check with the ferry operator for the latest schedules and fares.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nTaiwan has an extensive domestic air network, with several airlines operating flights between the main cities. The main domestic airlines in Taiwan are China Airlines, EVA Air, and Uni Air, which operate flights to destinations such as Taipei, Kaohsiung, Taichung, and Taitung. Booking domestic flights in advance is recommended, especially during peak travel seasons, to ensure availability and to get the best fares. Approximate costs for domestic flights range from $50 to $200 USD, depending on the route and airline.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nTaiwan has an extensive and modern rail network, with several types of trains operating on different routes. The Taiwan High-Speed Rail (THSR) is a high-speed rail line that connects Taipei to Kaohsiung, with stops at several major cities along the way. The THSR is a convenient and efficient way to travel long distances, with journey times of just over two hours between Taipei and Kaohsiung. The Taiwan Railways Administration (TRA) operates a network of conventional trains, including express and local trains, which connect to smaller towns and rural areas. Booking train tickets in advance is recommended, especially for the THSR, as seats can fill up quickly.\n\n[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]\nTaiwan has an extensive network of buses and coaches, which operate on both intercity and local routes. Several private bus companies, such as Kuo-Kuang Bus and U-Bus, operate services between major cities, while the Taiwan Bus Company operates a network of local buses. Bus travel is generally cheaper than train travel, with fares ranging from $10 to $30 USD, depending on the route and operator. However, journey times can be longer, especially for intercity routes.\n\n[SECTION] City Transport [/SECTION]\n| Mode | Available In | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metro/Subway | Taipei, Kaohsiung, Taichung | $1-$2 | Efficient and convenient |\n| City Bus | All cities | $1-$2 | Extensive network, but can be confusing for tourists |\n| Taxi | Everywhere | $2-$5/km | Metered, but some drivers may not speak English |\n| Ride-Hailing | Taipei, Kaohsiung, Taichung | $5-$10 | Convenient, but may not be available in all areas |\n| Tuk-tuk/Rickshaw | Some tourist areas | $5-$10 | Traditional, but not a common mode of transport |\n\n[SECTION] Driving [/SECTION]\n- To drive in Taiwan, you will need to obtain a temporary driving permit, which can be issued at the airport or at a local motor vehicle office.\n- Road conditions in Taiwan are generally good, with well-maintained highways and urban roads.\n- Fuel costs in Taiwan are relatively high, with gasoline prices ranging from $1.50 to $2.50 USD per liter.\n- Car rental companies, such as Avis and Hertz, have offices at major airports and cities, and offer a range of vehicles for rent.\n- Driving in Taiwan can be challenging, especially in urban areas, due to heavy traffic and aggressive driving styles.\n- It is essential to be aware of the local traffic laws and regulations, such as the requirement to wear a seatbelt and to use headlights during the day.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be aware of **traffic scams**, where drivers may try to overcharge or take you on a longer route than necessary.\n- Payment methods for public transport in Taiwan include cash, credit cards, and the **Easycard**, a prepaid card that can be used on buses, trains, and metro lines.\n- Download the **Taiwan Railway** app or the **Google Maps** app to help you navigate the public transport system.\n- Be mindful of **peak hour** traffic, which can cause significant delays in urban areas.\n- Consider purchasing a **prepaid SIM card** or a **portable Wi-Fi hotspot** to stay connected and navigate the transport system.\n- Be respectful of local customs and traditions, especially when using public transport during peak hours or in rural areas.\n- Keep an eye on your belongings, especially in crowded areas or tourist hotspots, to avoid **pickpocketing** or **theft**.\n- Consider using a **reputable taxi company** or a **ride-hailing app** to ensure a safe and reliable journey.",
