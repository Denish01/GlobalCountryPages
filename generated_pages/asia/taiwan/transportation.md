[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Taiwan has two main international airports, Taoyuan International Airport (TPE) and Kaohsiung International Airport (KHH), which serve as the primary gateways to the country. Taoyuan International Airport is the larger of the two and is located about 30 kilometers west of Taipei, the capital city. Direct flights to Taiwan are available from major hubs in Asia, Europe, and North America, including Tokyo, Seoul, Hong Kong, and Los Angeles. Overland entry points to Taiwan are limited, as the country is an island, but it is possible to take a ferry from China or Japan.

For travelers who prefer to arrive by sea, there are several ports in Taiwan that offer ferry services from neighboring countries. The most common overland entry point is the port city of Kaohsiung, which receives ferries from China and the Philippines. However, it is essential to note that these services may be subject to change, and it is always best to check with the ferry operator for the latest schedules and fares.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Taiwan has an extensive domestic air network, with several airlines operating flights between the main cities. The main domestic airlines in Taiwan are China Airlines, EVA Air, and Uni Air, which operate flights to destinations such as Taipei, Kaohsiung, Taichung, and Taitung. Booking domestic flights in advance is recommended, especially during peak travel seasons, to ensure availability and to get the best fares. Approximate costs for domestic flights range from $50 to $200 USD, depending on the route and airline.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Taiwan has an extensive and modern rail network, with several types of trains operating on different routes. The Taiwan High-Speed Rail (THSR) is a high-speed rail line that connects Taipei to Kaohsiung, with stops at several major cities along the way. The THSR is a convenient and efficient way to travel long distances, with journey times of just over two hours between Taipei and Kaohsiung. The Taiwan Railways Administration (TRA) operates a network of conventional trains, including express and local trains, which connect to smaller towns and rural areas. Booking train tickets in advance is recommended, especially for the THSR, as seats can fill up quickly.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
Taiwan has an extensive network of buses and coaches, which operate on both intercity and local routes. Several private bus companies, such as Kuo-Kuang Bus and U-Bus, operate services between major cities, while the Taiwan Bus Company operates a network of local buses. Bus travel is generally cheaper than train travel, with fares ranging from $10 to $30 USD, depending on the route and operator. However, journey times can be longer, especially for intercity routes.
