Taiwan has become an increasingly popular destination for expats, drawn by its unique blend of traditional Chinese culture and modern amenities. The island nation offers a high standard of living, with good healthcare, education, and infrastructure, making it an attractive choice for individuals and families alike. Many expats are also drawn to Taiwan's vibrant culture, rich history, and stunning natural beauty, from the bustling streets of Taipei to the scenic coastal towns and mountains.

Expats in Taiwan are a diverse group, with many coming from the United States, Europe, and other parts of Asia. They are often professionals, entrepreneurs, or students, and many are drawn to Taiwan's thriving tech industry, as well as its friendly and welcoming people.
