Taiwan has a high-tech industry-driven economy, while Japan has a more mature and diverse economy with a strong service sector. In terms of cost of living, Taiwan is generally cheaper than Japan, with lower prices for housing, food, and transportation. However, Japan has a more comprehensive and efficient public transportation system, which can be a significant advantage for expats and tourists. Overall, Taiwan offers a more affordable lifestyle, with a lower cost of living that can be attractive to students, retirees, and families.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a role in their cost of living. Taiwan has a growing economy with a strong focus on technology and manufacturing, which has driven up wages and prices in recent years. Japan, on the other hand, has a more mature economy with a slower pace of growth, which has kept prices relatively stable.
