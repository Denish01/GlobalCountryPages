The island is located approximately 160 kilometers off the southeastern coast of China, with the Taiwan Strait separating the two. To the north and east, Taiwan is surrounded by the Japanese island of Okinawa and the Philippine island of Luzon, respectively. The country's strategic location at the intersection of several major shipping lanes has made it an important hub for trade and commerce in the region.

The borders of Taiwan are primarily maritime, with the exception of several small islands that are also part of the country. The island of Taiwan itself is the largest in the country, accounting for the majority of the land area. Several smaller islands, including Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu, are also part of Taiwan and are located off the coast of the mainland. These islands have played an important role in the country's history and continue to be significant culturally and economically.
