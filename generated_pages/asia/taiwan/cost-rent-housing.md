[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Taiwan's rental market is relatively competitive, with a wide range of options available in cities like Taipei, Kaohsiung, and Taichung. Typical lease terms are one to two years, with a two-month deposit required in most cases. Tenant rights are protected by law, and renters can expect to have a written contract outlining the terms of the agreement. Compared to regional neighbors like Japan and South Korea, Taiwan's housing costs are relatively moderate, although prices can vary significantly depending on the location and quality of the accommodation. The government has implemented policies to control housing prices and ensure affordability, but the market can still be challenging for expats and locals alike.

The rental market in Taiwan is also influenced by the country's unique culture and customs. For example, many landlords prefer to rent to Taiwanese nationals or expats with a guarantor, which can make it more difficult for foreigners to find accommodation. Additionally, the concept of **saving face** is important in Taiwanese culture, which can affect the way landlords and tenants interact with each other. Understanding these cultural nuances can be helpful for expats navigating the rental market in Taiwan. Taiwan's housing costs are generally lower than those in Hong Kong or Singapore, but higher than in some other parts of Southeast Asia.
