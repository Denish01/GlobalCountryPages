[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
Taiwan's education system is highly regarded, with a strong emphasis on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. Public education is generally of high quality and is free or heavily subsidized, making it an attractive option for locals and expats alike. However, the language of instruction is primarily Mandarin, which can be a barrier for international students who do not speak the language. Compulsory education in Taiwan lasts for 12 years, from age 6 to 18, and includes primary, junior high, and senior high school. International schools are also available, offering a range of curricula, including the International Baccalaureate (IB) and the American curriculum.

Private education in Taiwan is also of high quality, with many private schools offering a range of extracurricular activities and facilities. However, the cost of private education can be prohibitively expensive, with some top-tier private schools charging over $10,000 per year. International schools, on the other hand, offer a more diverse range of curricula and are often favored by expat families. However, the cost of international schools can be even higher, with some schools charging over $20,000 per year.
