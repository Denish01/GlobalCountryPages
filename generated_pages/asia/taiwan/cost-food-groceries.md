[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]
When it comes to shopping for groceries, Taiwan offers a range of options, from supermarkets to local markets. Supermarkets like Carrefour and Wellcome tend to be more expensive than local markets, but they offer a wider range of products, including imported goods. Local markets, on the other hand, offer fresh produce, meats, and seafood at lower prices, but the selection may be limited. For example, a kilogram of apples may cost around $2-3 USD at a supermarket, while at a local market, it may cost around $1.50-2.50 USD. It's worth noting that local markets often have a more vibrant atmosphere, with vendors calling out to customers and offering samples of their products.

In general, it's recommended to buy fresh produce, meats, and seafood at local markets, while supermarkets are better for packaged goods, dairy products, and imported items. Bargaining is not common in Taiwan, especially at supermarkets, but at local markets, vendors may be willing to negotiate prices, especially for bulk purchases. When shopping at local markets, it's a good idea to learn some basic Mandarin phrases, such as "duōshǎo qián" (how much money) and "piān yi diǎn" (a little cheaper), to help you navigate the market and get the best prices.
