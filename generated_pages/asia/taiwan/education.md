The education system in Taiwan is divided into three main stages: primary, secondary, and tertiary education. Primary education, which is compulsory for all children, starts at the age of six and lasts for six years. Secondary education, also compulsory, is divided into two stages: junior high school, which lasts for three years, and senior high school, which lasts for three years. Tertiary education, which is not compulsory, includes universities, colleges, and vocational schools. The quality of education in Taiwan is generally high, with a strong emphasis on **science**, **technology**, **engineering**, and **mathematics (STEM)** subjects. Public schools are free for all citizens, while private schools, which offer a more comprehensive education, are available for those who can afford them.

The education system in Taiwan is highly competitive, with students facing intense pressure to perform well in exams. This has led to a thriving **cram school** industry, where students attend private schools outside of regular school hours to receive additional tuition. Despite this, the education system in Taiwan has produced many high-achieving students, with Taiwan ranking among the top countries in the world in terms of **mathematics** and **science** education.

The government of Taiwan has also implemented various reforms to improve the education system, including the introduction of **English** as a compulsory subject in primary schools and the promotion of **vocational education**.
