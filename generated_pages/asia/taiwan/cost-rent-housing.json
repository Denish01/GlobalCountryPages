Typical lease terms are one to two years, with a two-month deposit required in most cases. Tenant rights are protected by law, and renters can expect to have a written contract outlining the terms of the agreement. Compared to regional neighbors like Japan and South Korea, Taiwan's housing costs are relatively moderate, although prices can vary significantly depending on the location and quality of the accommodation. The government has implemented policies to control housing prices and ensure affordability, but the market can still be challenging for expats and locals alike.\n\nThe rental market in Taiwan is also influenced by the country's unique culture and customs. For example, many landlords prefer to rent to Taiwanese nationals or expats with a guarantor, which can make it more difficult for foreigners to find accommodation. Additionally, the concept of **saving face** is important in Taiwanese culture, which can affect the way landlords and tenants interact with each other. Understanding these cultural nuances can be helpful for expats navigating the rental market in Taiwan. Taiwan's housing costs are generally lower than those in Hong Kong or Singapore, but higher than in some other parts of Southeast Asia.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $400-$700 | $250-$500 | (typical quality, 20-30 sqm) |\n| 1 Bedroom | $600-$1,000 | $400-$800 | (what to expect, 40-60 sqm) |\n| 2 Bedroom | $1,000-$1,800 | $700-$1,400 | (family size, 80-120 sqm) |\n| 3 Bedroom | $1,500-$3,000 | $1,000-$2,500 | (spacious, 150-250 sqm) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $2,500-$5,000 | (prime locations, e.g. Taipei 101) |\n| Suburbs | $1,500-$3,000 | (residential areas, e.g. Zhongshan District) |\n| Rural | $500-$1,500 | (if applicable, e.g. rural areas of Nantou County) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- Da’an District, Taipei: $800-$1,500 USD per month for a one-bedroom apartment, known for its trendy bars and restaurants\n- Zhongshan District, Taipei: $600-$1,200 USD per month for a one-bedroom apartment, a popular area for expats and families\n- Xinyi District, Taipei: $1,000-$2,500 USD per month for a one-bedroom apartment, a upscale area with easy access to Taipei 101\n- Kaohsiung City: $400-$900 USD per month for a one-bedroom apartment, a more laid-back and affordable alternative to Taipei\n- Taichung City: $500-$1,100 USD per month for a one-bedroom apartment, a growing expat community and a more relaxed pace of life\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Taiwan [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods thoroughly to find the best fit for your lifestyle and budget\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent to find a suitable apartment\n- Be prepared to provide documentation, such as a passport and proof of income, to secure a rental agreement\n- [CALLOUT] Be aware of scams targeting expats, such as fake rental listings or excessive fees\n- Utilities, such as water and electricity, are usually not included in the rent\n- Furnished apartments are less common in Taiwan, but can be found in some areas, especially in Taipei\n- Learn some basic **Mandarin Chinese** phrases to help navigate the rental process and communicate with landlords\n- Consider purchasing **renters' insurance** to protect against unexpected expenses or losses",
