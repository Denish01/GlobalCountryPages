[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Taiwan's population size is relatively small compared to other countries in Asia, but its population density is among the highest in the world. The population growth rate has been steadily declining over the years, mainly due to a low fertility rate and an aging population. Urbanization has been a significant trend in Taiwan, with the majority of the population residing in urban areas, particularly in the northern regions of the island. The capital city, Taipei, is the most populous city, with over 2.7 million residents. Migration patterns have also played a crucial role in shaping Taiwan's population, with many Taiwanese citizens traveling abroad for work, education, or other opportunities.

The population of Taiwan is expected to continue aging, with significant implications for the country's economy, healthcare system, and social security. The low fertility rate has led to concerns about the potential labor shortage and the impact on the country's pension system. To address these issues, the government has implemented policies to encourage families to have more children, such as providing subsidies for childcare and education. Additionally, the government has also been actively promoting immigration to supplement the workforce and mitigate the effects of an aging population.

Taiwan's population size and growth trends are closely tied to its economic development, with the country experiencing rapid economic growth over the past few decades. However, the population's aging and low fertility rate pose significant challenges to the country's long-term economic sustainability. The government has been working to address these challenges by investing in education, healthcare, and social welfare programs, as well as promoting innovation and entrepreneurship to drive economic growth.
