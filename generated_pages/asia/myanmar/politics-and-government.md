[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Myanmar is based on a **unitary system**, where the central government holds significant power and authority. The **separation of powers** is established between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches, although the military has historically played a dominant role in politics. The **constitution**, adopted in 2008, outlines the framework of the government and the relationship between the different branches. However, the military's influence and the lack of **checks and balances** have raised concerns about the stability and accountability of the government.

The **executive branch** is headed by the President, who serves as the **head of state** and is responsible for appointing the Prime Minister and other ministers. The **legislative branch**, known as the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw, is a bicameral body composed of the Pyithu Hluttaw (House of Representatives) and the Amyotha Hluttaw (House of Nationalities). The **judicial branch** is headed by the Supreme Court, which is responsible for interpreting the constitution and laws.

Myanmar's **political system** has been marked by periods of military rule and democratic transition. The country has a complex history of **military intervention** in politics, with the military dominating the government for many years. However, in recent years, there have been efforts to transition to a more democratic system, with **free and fair elections** held in 2015 and 2020.
