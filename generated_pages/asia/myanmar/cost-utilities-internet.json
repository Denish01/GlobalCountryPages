The cost of utilities can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher electricity costs during the hot summer months and higher water costs during the dry season. The government has been working to improve the utility infrastructure, but the costs can still be unstable and vary depending on the location and provider.\n\nThe cost of utilities in Myanmar is also affected by the inflation rate, which was 8.8% in 2019. This means that the cost of utilities can increase significantly over time, making it important for residents to budget accordingly. Additionally, the cost of utilities can vary depending on the type of accommodation, with apartments in urban areas tend to have higher utility costs than houses in rural areas.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $30 | $50 | $70 | |\n| Water | $10 | $20 | $30 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $10 | $15 | $20 | |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $5 | $10 | $15 | (if separate) |\n| **Total** | **$55** | **$95** | **$135** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $20-30 | 10-30 Mbps | Myanmar Net, 5BB Broadband |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $50-70 | 100-500 Mbps | Myanmar Net, 5BB Broadband |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $5-10 | 1-5 GB | MPT, Telenor, Ooredoo |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $10-20 | 5-10 GB | MPT, Telenor, Ooredoo |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $30-50 | varies | MPT, Telenor, Ooredoo |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (if applicable) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities, residents typically need to provide identification and proof of address to the provider.\n- Prepaid electricity meters are common in Myanmar, and can be a cost-effective option for residents who want to control their electricity usage.\n- The best internet providers in Myanmar include Myanmar Net and 5BB Broadband, which offer fast and reliable connections.\n- To save on utility bills, residents can consider using energy-efficient appliances, turning off lights and electronics when not in use, and using public transportation or walking instead of driving.\n- It's also a good idea to negotiate with the provider to get the best rate, especially for long-term contracts.",
