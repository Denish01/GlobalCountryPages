[/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nMyanmar has a moderate visa policy, with a mix of visa-free access, visa on arrival, and required visas for different nationalities. The country has been opening up to tourism and foreign investment in recent years, but still maintains a relatively strict stance on immigration. Citizens of around 10 countries, including Japan, South Korea, and some Southeast Asian nations, enjoy visa-free access to Myanmar for a limited period. However, most nationalities require a visa to enter the country.\n\nThe Myanmar government has introduced an e-visa system, which allows travelers to apply for a visa online and receive an electronic visa approval letter. This has streamlined the application process and made it easier for tourists and business travelers to visit the country. However, it's essential to note that visa requirements can change, and it's always best to check with the official embassy or consulate of Myanmar for the latest information.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | Yes | eVisa | 28 days | Must apply online in advance |\n| UK Citizens | Yes | eVisa | 28 days | Must apply online in advance |\n| EU Citizens | Yes | eVisa | 28 days | Must apply online in advance |\n| Canadian Citizens | Yes | eVisa | 28 days | Must apply online in advance |\n| Australian Citizens | Yes | eVisa | 28 days | Must apply online in advance |\n| Indian Citizens | No | Visa on Arrival | 30 days | Must meet specific requirements |\n| Chinese Citizens | Yes | eVisa | 28 days | Must apply online in advance |\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can apply for an e-visa, which is valid for a single entry and allows a stay of up to 28 days.
