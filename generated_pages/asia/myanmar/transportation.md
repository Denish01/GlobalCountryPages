[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Myanmar has three main international airports: Yangon International Airport (RGN), Mandalay International Airport (MDL), and Naypyidaw International Airport (NYT). Yangon is the primary gateway to the country, with direct flights from major hubs in Asia, including Bangkok, Singapore, and Kuala Lumpur. Mandalay also receives international flights, primarily from China and Thailand. Overland entry points are available from neighboring countries, including Thailand, China, India, Bangladesh, and Laos, with bus and train services connecting to major cities in Myanmar.

For those traveling overland, the most common entry points are at the border towns of Tachileik, Myawaddy, and Tamu, where visitors can cross into Myanmar from Thailand, Laos, and India, respectively. It is essential to research the requirements for overland travel, including any necessary visas and permits, as well as the current security situation in the border regions. Additionally, some border crossings may be restricted or require special permission, so it is crucial to plan carefully and stay informed.
