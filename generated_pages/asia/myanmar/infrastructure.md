[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 50% of population
Internet Penetration: 25%
Road Network: 34,377 km, with moderate quality roads and limited rural connectivity
Rail Network: 5,068 km
Major Airports: 8
Major Ports: 8
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Myanmar's infrastructure development has been steadily progressing over the past decade, with a focus on improving the country's transportation network, energy sector, and telecommunications. The government has been investing heavily in new projects, including the construction of new roads, bridges, and airports, as well as the expansion of the rail network. However, despite these efforts, there is still a significant gap in infrastructure development between urban and rural areas, with many rural communities lacking access to basic services such as electricity, clean water, and sanitation.

The country's infrastructure development has also been hindered by a lack of investment and maintenance over the years, which has resulted in a significant backlog of repairs and upgrades needed to bring the existing infrastructure up to standard. Additionally, the country's geography, with its rugged terrain and numerous rivers, presents significant challenges to infrastructure development, particularly in rural areas. Despite these challenges, the government has made significant progress in recent years, and the country's infrastructure is slowly but surely improving.

The government has also been working to attract foreign investment to support infrastructure development, and several major projects are currently underway, including the construction of a new deep-sea port and the development of a major new industrial zone. These projects are expected to have a significant impact on the country's economy and will help to drive further infrastructure development in the years to come.
