  "content": "Myanmar's infrastructure is still developing, with significant gaps in rural areas, but recent investments have improved the overall network, especially in the transportation and energy sectors. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nElectricity Access: 50% of population\nInternet Penetration: 25%\nRoad Network: 34,377 km, with moderate quality roads and limited rural connectivity\nRail Network: 5,068 km\nMajor Airports: 8\nMajor Ports: 8\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]\nMyanmar's infrastructure development has been steadily progressing over the past decade, with a focus on improving the country's transportation network, energy sector, and telecommunications. The government has been investing heavily in new projects, including the construction of new roads, bridges, and airports, as well as the expansion of the rail network. However, despite these efforts, there is still a significant gap in infrastructure development between urban and rural areas, with many rural communities lacking access to basic services such as electricity, clean water, and sanitation.\n\nThe country's infrastructure development has also been hindered by a lack of investment and maintenance over the years, which has resulted in a significant backlog of repairs and upgrades needed to bring the existing infrastructure up to standard. Additionally, the country's geography, with its rugged terrain and numerous rivers, presents significant challenges to infrastructure development, particularly in rural areas. Despite these challenges, the government has made significant progress in recent years, and the country's infrastructure is slowly but surely improving.\n\nThe government has also been working to attract foreign investment to support infrastructure development, and several major projects are currently underway, including the construction of a new deep-sea port and the development of a major new industrial zone. These projects are expected to have a significant impact on the country's economy and will help to drive further infrastructure development in the years to come.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Coverage | Quality | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roads | 34,377 km | Moderate | Limited rural connectivity, poor road conditions in some areas |\n| Railways | 5,068 km | Poor | Limited passenger services, mostly used for freight |\n| Airports | 8 international, 45 domestic | Good | Major airports in Yangon and Mandalay, with international flights to regional destinations |\n| Ports | 8 major | Good | Major ports in Yangon and Sittwe, with significant cargo handling capacity |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Energy & Electricity [/SECTION]\n- Myanmar's **power generation** is primarily based on hydroelectric power, with several major dams located on the country's rivers.\n- The country's **energy sector** is still developing, with significant challenges related to energy distribution and transmission.\n- **Renewable energy** sources, such as solar and wind power, are becoming increasingly important, with several major projects currently underway.\n- **Power outages** are still common, particularly in rural areas, where the grid is often unreliable.\n- The government has set a target of increasing **electricity access** to 100% of the population by 2030, with significant investments planned in the energy sector.\n\n[SECTION] Water & Sanitation [/SECTION]\n- **Tap water safety** is a significant concern, with many people relying on alternative sources such as wells and rivers.\n- **Sanitation coverage** is still limited, particularly in rural areas, where many communities lack access to basic sanitation facilities.\n- **Water access** is a significant challenge in rural areas, where many communities rely on traditional sources such as wells and ponds.\n- The government has made significant progress in recent years in improving **water treatment** facilities, with several new plants constructed in major cities.\n- **Rural water supply** programs are being implemented to improve access to clean water in rural areas, with a focus on community-based management systems.\n\n[SECTION] Telecommunications [/SECTION]\n- **Mobile coverage** is widespread, with several major operators providing services across the country.\n- **Fiber optic** connectivity is becoming increasingly available, particularly in urban areas, with several major projects currently underway.\n- **4G/5G rollout** is progressing slowly, with several major operators launching services in recent years.\n- **Postal services** are still widely used, particularly in rural areas, where other forms of communication may be limited.\n- The government has made significant investments in **telecommunications infrastructure**, with a focus on improving connectivity and access to services across the country.\n\n[SECTION] Development Projects [/SECTION]\n- The **China-Myanmar Economic Corridor** is a major development project aimed at improving transportation links between the two countries.\n- The **Myanmar National Transport Master Plan** aims to improve the country's transportation network, with a focus on roads, railways, and ports.\n- The **Ayeyarwady River Bridge** project aims to improve connectivity between the country's major cities, with several new bridges currently under construction.\n- The **Thilawa Special Economic Zone** is a major industrial development project, with a focus on manufacturing and logistics.\n- The **Myanmar Energy Master Plan** aims to improve the country's energy sector, with a focus on increasing electricity access and promoting renewable energy sources.",
