# Myanmar Visa & Entry Requirements

[CALLOUT] Visa rules change frequently. Always verify current requirements with the official embassy or consulate of Myanmar before traveling. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]
Myanmar has a moderate visa policy, with a mix of visa-free access, visa on arrival, and required visas for different nationalities. The country has been opening up to tourism and foreign investment in recent years, but still maintains a relatively strict stance on immigration. Citizens of around 10 countries, including Japan, South Korea, and some Southeast Asian nations, enjoy visa-free access to Myanmar for a limited period. However, most nationalities require a visa to enter the country.

The Myanmar government has introduced an e-visa system, which allows travelers to apply for a visa online and receive an electronic visa approval letter. This has streamlined the application process and made it easier for tourists and business travelers to visit the country. However, it's essential to note that visa requirements can change, and it's always best to check with the official embassy or consulate of Myanmar for the latest information.

Upon arrival, travelers can exchange currency, purchase a SIM card, and arrange for transportation to their destination.
