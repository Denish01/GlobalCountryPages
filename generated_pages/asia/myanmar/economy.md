[SECTION] Economic Overview [/SECTION]
Myanmar, a sovereign country in Southeast Asia, has a lower-middle-income economy with a mix of state-owned and private enterprises. The country's economy is primarily driven by agriculture, which employs a significant portion of the workforce. Myanmar's economic development has been hindered by decades of isolationist policies, but since the opening up of the economy in 2011, the country has experienced rapid growth. The government has implemented various reforms to attract foreign investment and promote economic development. However, the economy still faces challenges such as corruption, inadequate infrastructure, and a lack of skilled labor.

Myanmar's economic classification is a lower-middle-income economy, with a GDP per capita of around $1,244. The country's economy is still in the development stage, with a significant portion of the population engaged in agriculture and small-scale industries. The government has set ambitious targets to become a middle-income country by 2030, with a focus on industrialization, urbanization, and human resource development. To achieve this goal, the government is investing heavily in infrastructure development, including transportation networks, energy, and telecommunications.

The economic trajectory of Myanmar is expected to be positive, driven by foreign investment, infrastructure development, and a growing services sector.

However, the economy is also vulnerable to external shocks, such as fluctuations in global commodity prices and changes in international trade policies. To mitigate these risks, the government is promoting economic diversification and encouraging foreign investment in various sectors, including manufacturing, tourism, and technology.
