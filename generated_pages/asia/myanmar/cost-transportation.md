[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Myanmar has a range of transportation options, including buses, taxis, trains, and ride-hailing services. The quality of public transit varies between cities, with Yangon and Mandalay having more comprehensive systems than smaller towns. Most people in Myanmar get around using a combination of these modes, with many opting for affordable and convenient options like city buses and shared taxis. The country's transportation network is still developing, with ongoing infrastructure projects aimed at improving connectivity and reducing travel times.

In addition to public transportation, many locals in Myanmar rely on **motorcycles** and **bicycles** for short trips, while others use **trishaws** and **horse-drawn carriages** for a more traditional experience. The government has also invested in improving the country's **road network**, with many new highways and bridges being built to connect major cities and towns. Despite these efforts, traffic congestion remains a significant challenge in urban areas, particularly during peak hours.
