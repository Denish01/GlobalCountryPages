[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]
Myanmar's education system is divided into public and private sectors, with the public sector being the largest. Public schools are generally free or low-cost, but the quality of education can be poor due to limited resources and outdated teaching methods. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a higher quality of education, but at a significant cost. The language of instruction in Myanmar is **Burmese**, but some private schools and international institutions may offer instruction in **English** or other languages. Compulsory education in Myanmar lasts for 11 years, from age 5 to 16, and is divided into primary, lower secondary, and upper secondary levels. International schools are available in major cities like Yangon and Naypyidaw, offering a range of curricula, including **International Baccalaureate** and **Cambridge International Examinations**.

The quality of education in Myanmar's public sector is a major concern, with many schools lacking basic infrastructure and resources. Teacher training and qualifications are also a issue, with many teachers not having the necessary qualifications or experience. In contrast, private schools and international institutions offer a much higher quality of education, with better resources, qualified teachers, and a more modern curriculum. However, these institutions are often expensive and out of reach for many Myanmar families. For expats and international students, international schools are a popular option, offering a familiar curriculum and teaching style.
