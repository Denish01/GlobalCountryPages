  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Myanmar can vary greatly, with a significant portion of the population relying on out-of-pocket expenses, and the average healthcare expenditure per capita standing at $56.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $56 (2023)\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 71.1% (2023)\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 192\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: MMK\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nMyanmar's healthcare system is a mixed model, consisting of both public and private healthcare providers. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of lower quality, with limited resources and facilities, especially in rural areas. In contrast, private healthcare providers offer better quality care, but at a significantly higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the only affordable option, while foreigners and affluent locals tend to opt for private healthcare. It is recommended that visitors and expats have some form of health insurance to cover unexpected medical expenses, as the cost of healthcare can be high, especially in private facilities.\n\nThe healthcare system in Myanmar is still developing, and there is a significant shortage of skilled healthcare professionals and medical equipment. However, in recent years, there has been an increase in the number of private hospitals and clinics, especially in major cities like Yangon and Mandalay. These private facilities often have better equipment and more qualified staff, but they can be expensive. For foreigners, it is often recommended to seek medical care at one of these private facilities, as they are more likely to have English-speaking staff and modern equipment.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $5-$10 | $20-$50 | |\n| Specialist Consultation | $10-$20 | $50-$100 | |\n| Dental Checkup | $10-$20 | $30-$70 | |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$20 | $30-$70 | |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $20-$30 | $50-$100 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$100 | |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $50-$200 | |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$1,500 | |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $500-$1,000 | |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | |\n| X-Ray | $20-$50 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Covers basic medical expenses, including doctor visits and hospital stays |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-$300 | Covers a wide range of medical expenses, including specialist consultations and surgeries |\n| International / Expat | $200-$500 | Covers medical expenses worldwide, including evacuation and repatriation |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Prescription medication can be purchased at pharmacies with a valid prescription from a licensed doctor\n- Over-the-counter medication is widely available, but the quality and authenticity of these medications can vary\n- Common medications like pain relievers and antibiotics can cost between $5-$10 per pack\n- More specialized medications can cost $20-$50 per pack\n- Pharmacies are widely available in urban areas, but can be scarce in rural areas\n- It is recommended to purchase medication from reputable pharmacies to ensure authenticity and quality\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is recommended to seek care at a private hospital or clinic, as they are more likely to have the necessary equipment and staff to provide adequate care. The emergency number in Myanmar is 192, but it is not always reliable, and it may be better to call a private ambulance service or go directly to a hospital. Some of the best hospitals for foreigners in Myanmar include the Yangon General Hospital and the Mandalay General Hospital, which have better facilities and more qualified staff. However, even in these hospitals, the quality of care can vary, and it is often recommended to seek a second opinion or evacuate to a neighboring country for more complex medical procedures.\n\nIt is also worth noting that emergency care in Myanmar can be expensive, and it is recommended to have some form of health insurance to cover unexpected medical expenses. Additionally, it is a good idea to research local hospitals and medical facilities before an emergency arises, and to have a plan in place for emergency situations. This can include having a list of emergency contact numbers, knowing the location of nearby hospitals, and having a means of transportation to get to a hospital quickly. By being prepared and having a plan in place, foreigners can reduce their risk of encountering medical problems in Myanmar and ensure that they receive the best possible care in the event of an emergency.",
