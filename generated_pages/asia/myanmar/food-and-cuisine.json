Regional variations are also significant, with different ethnic groups having their own unique dishes and cooking styles. For example, the Shan people are known for their **Shan-style noodles**, while the Rakhine people are famous for their **Rakhine-style mont di**, a type of rice noodle dish.\n\nThe influence of Buddhism is also evident in Myanmar's cuisine, with many dishes being designed to be shared and eaten with others. **Lahpet**, or pickled tea leaves, is a popular snack that is often served at social gatherings and is believed to have medicinal properties.
