However, the overall internet quality remains inconsistent, with urban areas generally having better connectivity and speeds compared to rural areas. In major cities like Yangon and Mandalay, internet speeds are relatively fast, with many cafes, restaurants, and hotels offering **WiFi** services. On the other hand, rural areas often struggle with slow and unreliable connections, making it challenging for residents to access basic online services.\n\nDespite these challenges, the Myanmar government has been working to expand internet access and improve connectivity across the country. The introduction of **4G** networks has significantly enhanced mobile internet speeds, and **5G** services are expected to be rolled out in the near future. However, the reliability of internet services can be affected by various factors, including power outages, network congestion, and maintenance issues. As a result, it's essential for users to have backup internet options, such as mobile hotspots or SIM cards from different carriers, to ensure uninterrupted connectivity.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nGetting a SIM card in Myanmar is relatively straightforward, with several mobile carriers offering tourist-friendly plans. The main carriers, including MPT, Telenor, and Ooredoo, have outlets at major airports, cities, and towns, where you can purchase a SIM card. To buy a SIM card, you'll need to provide your passport and a photocopy of the identification page. The cost of a tourist SIM card is approximately 5-10 USD, and you can top up your account with various data plans. It's recommended to purchase a SIM card from a reputable carrier, as they often offer better coverage and customer support.\n\nWhen selecting a carrier, consider factors such as network coverage, data speeds, and pricing. MPT is the largest carrier in Myanmar, with extensive coverage across the country, while Telenor and Ooredoo offer competitive data plans and better speeds in urban areas.
