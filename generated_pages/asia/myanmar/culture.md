# Myanmar Culture - Food, Traditions & Etiquette

[SECTION] Cultural Identity [/SECTION]
Myanmar's culture is a rich tapestry of influences, with a strong foundation in **Buddhism**, which is practiced by approximately 80% of the population. The country's strategic location at the crossroads of Asia has resulted in a unique blend of Indian, Chinese, and Southeast Asian cultural traditions. The ethnic makeup of Myanmar is diverse, with over 130 distinct ethnic groups, including the **Bamar**, **Shan**, **Karen**, and **Rohingya**. The official language, **Burmese**, is the primary language spoken, but many ethnic groups have their own languages and dialects.

Myanmar's cultural identity is also shaped by its complex history, with periods of colonization, monarchy, and military rule. The country's **monastic** tradition is particularly significant, with many young men spending time as **novice monks** to learn about Buddhism and develop important life skills. The concept of **"metta"** (loving-kindness) is central to Burmese culture, emphasizing the importance of compassion, empathy, and respect for all living beings. Myanmar's cultural heritage is also reflected in its vibrant **arts and crafts**, including intricate wood carvings, woven textiles, and delicate lacquerware.

The country's cultural landscape is also influenced by its geographic diversity, with **coastal**, **mountainous**, and **delta** regions each having their own unique cultural practices and traditions. For example, the **Inthar** people, who live on **Inle Lake**, are known for their skilled **fishing** and **agricultural** practices, as well as their distinctive **leg-rowing** technique. Overall, Myanmar's cultural identity is characterized by its rich diversity, strong spiritual traditions, and warm hospitality.
