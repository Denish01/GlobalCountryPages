The country's eating-out culture is prevalent, with many restaurants and street food stalls offering a wide range of local and international cuisine at affordable prices. However, the inflation rate of 8.8% in 2019 has driven up food prices, making it essential to budget accordingly. The cost of eating out can vary greatly depending on the type of establishment, with street food and local eateries offering the most affordable options.\n\nThe local cuisine in Myanmar is heavily influenced by its neighboring countries, with popular dishes such as laphet (pickled tea leaves), mohinga (fish-based breakfast dish), and shan noodles. Home cooking is also a significant part of the culture, with many locals preparing meals using fresh ingredients from local markets. The GDP per capita PPP of $5,997 in 2024 indicates a growing economy, which may lead to increased food prices in the future. However, with some planning and knowledge of local prices, it is possible to enjoy a wide range of delicious and affordable food options in Myanmar.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $1.50 | 2,500 MMK | |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $1.20 | 2,000 MMK | |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $1.80 | 3,000 MMK | |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $0.80 | 1,300 MMK | |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $3.50 | 5,800 MMK | |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $6.00 | 10,000 MMK | |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $2.50 | 4,200 MMK | |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $1.00 | 1,700 MMK | |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $0.60 | 1,000 MMK | |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $0.40 | 700 MMK | |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $4.00 | 6,700 MMK | |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $0.60 | 1,000 MMK | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $2-5 | (typical dishes like laphet, mohinga) |\n| Casual Restaurant | $5-10 | (one person, 2-3 courses) |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $15-25 | (3 courses, local cuisine) |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $30-50 | (upscale, international cuisine) |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $2-3 | |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $4-6 | |\n| Cappuccino | $2-4 | |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $1-2 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nThe prices of groceries and other essential items can vary significantly between supermarkets and local markets in Myanmar.
