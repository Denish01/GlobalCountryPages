  "content": "Healthcare in Myanmar is a mixed system with a combination of public and private providers, but the overall quality of care and access to facilities can be limited, especially in rural areas.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nQuality Rating: 2/5\nEmergency Number: 192\nHospital Standard: Basic\nInsurance Required: recommended\nPharmacy Access: moderate\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]\nMyanmar's healthcare system is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public sector is the primary provider of healthcare services, with a network of hospitals and clinics throughout the country. However, the public sector is often underfunded and understaffed, leading to a lack of resources and equipment. The private sector, on the other hand, offers higher-quality care, but at a significantly higher cost, making it inaccessible to many citizens. The quality of care in Myanmar is generally lower than in other countries in the region, with limited access to specialized care and a shortage of skilled healthcare professionals.\n\nThe healthcare system in Myanmar is also characterized by significant urban-rural disparities, with better-equipped and staffed facilities located in urban areas such as Yangon and Naypyidaw. In rural areas, access to healthcare is often limited, with many communities relying on traditional medicine and unqualified practitioners. The government has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, including the introduction of a national health plan and increased investment in healthcare infrastructure. However, much work remains to be done to address the significant challenges facing the healthcare system in Myanmar.\n\nDespite the challenges, there are some positive developments in the healthcare sector, with a growing number of private hospitals and clinics offering high-quality care, particularly in urban areas. Additionally, there are a number of international organizations and NGOs working in Myanmar to support the development of the healthcare system and improve access to care for vulnerable populations.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Yangon General Hospital | Yangon | Public | General medicine, surgery | Limited |\n| Pun Hlaing Hospital | Yangon | Private | Cardiology, oncology | Yes |\n| Myanmar Medical Association Hospital | Yangon | Private | General medicine, pediatrics | Yes |\n| Naypyidaw Hospital | Naypyidaw | Public | General medicine, surgery | Limited |\n| Parami Hospital | Yangon | Private | Orthopedics, neurology | Yes |\n| Asia Royal Hospital | Yangon | Private | General medicine, cardiology | Yes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Private health insurance** is recommended for foreigners and locals who can afford it, as it provides access to higher-quality care and more comprehensive coverage.\n- Local insurance options are available, but coverage is often limited and may not include access to private hospitals.\n- **Expats** should consider purchasing international health insurance that includes coverage for evacuation and repatriation.\n- The cost of health insurance in Myanmar can vary widely, depending on the provider and level of coverage.\n- Some employers may offer health insurance as part of their benefits package, but this is not always the case.\n- It is essential to carefully review the terms and conditions of any health insurance policy before purchasing.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Medications** are widely available in urban areas, but may be harder to find in rural areas.\n- A **prescription** is often required for certain medications, but this is not always enforced.\n- **Local brands** of medications are available, as well as some international brands.\n- The cost of medications in Myanmar can be relatively high, especially for imported brands.\n- It is essential to ensure that any medications purchased are from a reputable source and are not counterfeit.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Hepatitis A** and **typhoid** vaccinations are recommended for all travelers to Myanmar.\n- **Malaria** is a significant risk in some areas of the country, particularly in rural areas.\n- **Dengue fever** and **chikungunya** are also present in Myanmar, and travelers should take precautions to avoid mosquito bites.\n- **Rabies** is a risk, particularly for travelers who plan to spend time around animals.\n- **Water safety** is a concern, and travelers should avoid drinking tap water and stick to bottled or filtered water.\n- **Food safety** is also a concern, and travelers should avoid eating undercooked meat or raw vegetables.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **Medical tourism** is not a significant industry in Myanmar, but some private hospitals are starting to offer specialized services such as **cosmetic surgery** and **dental care**.\n- **Accredited hospitals** such as Pun Hlaing Hospital and Parami Hospital offer high-quality care and may be an option for medical tourists.\n- The cost of medical procedures in Myanmar can be significantly lower than in other countries, making it an attractive option for some medical tourists.\n- However, the overall quality of care and infrastructure in Myanmar may not be on par with other medical tourism destinations.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- In the event of an **emergency**, travelers should call the emergency number 192 or go to the nearest hospital.\n- **Ambulance** services are available, but may not be reliable or equipped with modern medical equipment.\n- **Nearest hospitals** should be identified in advance, particularly for travelers who plan to venture into rural areas.\n- **Insurance claims** should be submitted as soon as possible, and travelers should keep all receipts and documentation related to their medical care.\n- It is essential to have a **contingency plan** in place, including emergency contact information and a plan for evacuation if necessary.",
