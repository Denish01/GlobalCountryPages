[SECTION] How Myanmar Is Divided [/SECTION]
Myanmar is divided into 7 states and 7 regions, with the addition of 6 self-administered zones and 1 self-administered division. The states are primarily inhabited by ethnic minority groups, while the regions are predominantly inhabited by the Bamar people, the largest ethnic group in Myanmar. The administrative divisions are further subdivided into districts, townships, and villages, with each level having its own administrative body.

The division of Myanmar into states and regions is largely based on geographical and ethnic considerations. The states are located in the border areas, where ethnic minority groups are concentrated, while the regions are located in the central and coastal areas, where the Bamar people are predominantly found. This division has its roots in the country's colonial past, when the British administered the country as a collection of separate entities.

[SECTION] Getting Around [/SECTION]
Myanmar has a relatively underdeveloped transportation network, with limited domestic flights and train services. However, the country has a comprehensive network of buses and taxis, which are the primary mode of transportation for most people. The roads are generally in poor condition, especially in rural areas, and driving can be challenging due to the lack of road signs and traffic rules. However, the country is investing heavily in its transportation infrastructure, with new roads, bridges, and airports being built.

Domestic flights are available between major cities, such as Yangon, Mandalay, and Naypyidaw, and are a convenient way to travel long distances. Train services are also available, but are generally slow and uncomfortable. The most popular way to get around is by bus, with numerous private companies operating services between cities and towns. Taxis are also widely available, but are generally more expensive than buses. [CALLOUT] It is recommended to hire a private car and driver for long-distance travel, as this can be more convenient and comfortable than public transportation.
