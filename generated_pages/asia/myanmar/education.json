  "content": "The education system in Myanmar is a complex and evolving institution, with a strong emphasis on traditional values and a growing focus on modernization and internationalization. \n\n[FACTBOX]\nLiteracy Rate: 75.6%\nSchool System: 11 years of compulsory education\nLanguage of Instruction: Burmese\nAcademic Calendar: June to March\nInternational Schools: available\nTop University Ranking: ranked among the top 500 universities globally\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe education system in Myanmar is divided into three main stages: primary, secondary, and tertiary education. Primary education, which is compulsory for all children between the ages of 5 and 10, is designed to provide a basic education in subjects such as **Burmese language**, mathematics, and science. Secondary education, which is also compulsory, is divided into two stages: lower secondary (ages 11-14) and upper secondary (ages 15-18). At the tertiary level, students can choose to attend a university or college, where they can study a wide range of subjects, including **arts**, **sciences**, and **engineering**. The quality of education in Myanmar varies, with public schools often struggling with limited resources and outdated curricula, while private schools tend to offer higher-quality education and better facilities.\n\nThe structure of the education system in Myanmar is overseen by the **Ministry of Education**, which is responsible for setting national education policies and standards. However, the system is often criticized for being overly centralized and bureaucratic, which can limit the ability of schools and teachers to innovate and respond to the needs of their students. Despite these challenges, there are many dedicated teachers and educators in Myanmar who are working to improve the quality of education and provide students with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in an increasingly competitive and globalized world.\n\nIn recent years, the government of Myanmar has implemented a number of reforms aimed at improving the quality of education and increasing access to education for disadvantaged groups. These reforms have included the introduction of new curricula and teaching methods, as well as initiatives to increase funding for education and improve the quality of school infrastructure. However, much work remains to be done to address the many challenges facing the education system in Myanmar, including inadequate funding, limited access to education in rural areas, and a shortage of qualified teachers.\n\n[SECTION] Top Universities [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| University | Location | Known For | Est.
