  "content": "The cost of education in Myanmar varies significantly between public and private institutions, with public schools being generally free or low-cost, while private schools and international institutions can be quite expensive.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nEducation Spend (% GDP): 2.0%\nLiteracy Rate: 75.6%\nSchool System: 11 years of compulsory education\nAcademic Year: 10 months\nCurrency: MMK\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Education System Overview [/SECTION]\nMyanmar's education system is divided into public and private sectors, with the public sector being the largest. Public schools are generally free or low-cost, but the quality of education can be poor due to limited resources and outdated teaching methods. Private schools, on the other hand, offer a higher quality of education, but at a significant cost. The language of instruction in Myanmar is **Burmese**, but some private schools and international institutions may offer instruction in **English** or other languages. Compulsory education in Myanmar lasts for 11 years, from age 5 to 16, and is divided into primary, lower secondary, and upper secondary levels. International schools are available in major cities like Yangon and Naypyidaw, offering a range of curricula, including **International Baccalaureate** and **Cambridge International Examinations**.\n\nThe quality of education in Myanmar's public sector is a major concern, with many schools lacking basic infrastructure and resources. Teacher training and qualifications are also a issue, with many teachers not having the necessary qualifications or experience. In contrast, private schools and international institutions offer a much higher quality of education, with better resources, qualified teachers, and a more modern curriculum. However, these institutions are often expensive and out of reach for many Myanmar families. For expats and international students, international schools are a popular option, offering a familiar curriculum and teaching style.\n\n[SECTION] School Fees [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| School Type | Annual Fee (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public Primary | $0 (free) | Limited resources and outdated teaching methods |\n| Private Primary | $500-$2,000 | Range of quality and resources, depending on tier |\n| Public Secondary | $20-$50 (subsidized) | Limited resources and outdated teaching methods |\n| Private Secondary | $1,000-$5,000 | Range of quality and resources, depending on tier |\n| International School | $5,000-$15,000 | Offers **International Baccalaureate**, **Cambridge International Examinations**, and other curricula |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] University Tuition [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Institution Type | Annual Tuition - Local (USD) | Annual Tuition - International (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Public University | $100-$500 | $500-$1,000 | Limited resources and outdated teaching methods |\n| Private University | $1,000-$3,000 | $2,000-$5,000 | Range of quality and resources, depending on institution |\n| Top-Ranked University | $2,000-$5,000 | $3,000-$6,000 | **University of Yangon** and **University of Mandalay** are top-ranked institutions |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Other Education Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preschool / Daycare (monthly) | $50-$200 | Limited availability and range of quality |\n| Private Tutoring (per hour) | $10-$50 | Popular for students needing extra support |\n| Language Course (monthly) | $100-$500 | **English** and **Chinese** are popular languages to study |\n| School Supplies (annual) | $20-$100 | Basic supplies, such as notebooks and pens |\n| School Uniform | $10-$50 | Required for most schools, including public and private institutions |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Education Quality & Tips [/SECTION]\n- The **International School of Yangon** and **British International School** are popular options for expats and international students.\n- Scholarships are available for Myanmar students, particularly for those studying at public universities.\n- Online learning options are limited in Myanmar, but some institutions offer **distance learning** programs.\n- Education quality in Myanmar is generally lower compared to other countries in the region, such as **Thailand** and **Singapore**.\n- **English language proficiency** is highly valued in Myanmar, and students who can speak English fluently have better job prospects.\n- For students interested in studying **science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)** fields, private universities and international institutions may offer better resources and facilities.",
