  "content": "The population of Myanmar is approximately 54.4 million people, with a diverse range of ethnic groups, languages, and religions that shape the country's cultural identity.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nTotal Population: 54.4 million\nPopulation Growth Rate: 0.9%\nMedian Age: 28.8 years\nUrban Population: 30.9%\nPopulation Density: 80.3 per km2\nLife Expectancy: 66.7 years\nFertility Rate: 2.3 children per woman\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]\nMyanmar's population size is significant in the Southeast Asian region, with a relatively slow growth rate compared to other countries. The population is expected to continue growing, albeit at a decreasing rate, due to declining fertility rates and increasing urbanization. The urban population is concentrated in major cities such as Yangon and Mandalay, with many people migrating from rural areas in search of better economic opportunities. However, this migration has also led to concerns about overcrowding, poverty, and strain on urban resources.\n\nThe country's population is also characterized by a significant youth demographic, with approximately 25% of the population under the age of 15. This has implications for education, healthcare, and economic development, as the country seeks to provide opportunities for its young population. In terms of migration patterns, Myanmar has historically been a source country for migrant workers, with many citizens traveling to neighboring countries such as Thailand and Malaysia in search of employment.\n\nMyanmar's population is also affected by internal migration, with many people moving from rural areas to urban centers or from one region to another in search of better economic opportunities or to escape conflict. This has led to the growth of urban slums and informal settlements, highlighting the need for sustainable urban planning and development.\n\n[SECTION] Ethnic Groups [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Ethnic Group | Percentage | Region | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Bamar | 68% | Central Myanmar | Dominant ethnic group |\n| Shan | 9% | Shan State | Second-largest ethnic group |\n| Kayin | 7% | Kayin State | Historically marginalized group |\n| Rakhine | 4% | Rakhine State | Coastal region with distinct culture |\n| Mon | 3% | Mon State | Ancient civilization with rich cultural heritage |\n| Kayah | 2% | Kayah State | Smallest state in Myanmar |\n| Chin | 1% | Chin State | Mountainous region with diverse languages |\n[/TABLE]\nMyanmar is home to over 130 ethnic groups, each with their own distinct culture, language, and traditions. The Bamar ethnic group is the largest, making up approximately 68% of the population, while other significant groups include the Shan, Kayin, and Rakhine.
