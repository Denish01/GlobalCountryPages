[SECTION] Utility Costs Overview [/SECTION]
Myanmar's utility infrastructure is still developing, with some areas experiencing frequent power outages and water shortages. The cost of utilities can fluctuate depending on the season, with higher electricity costs during the hot summer months and higher water costs during the dry season. The government has been working to improve the utility infrastructure, but the costs can still be unstable and vary depending on the location and provider.

The cost of utilities in Myanmar is also affected by the inflation rate, which was 8.8% in 2019. This means that the cost of utilities can increase significantly over time, making it important for residents to budget accordingly. Additionally, the cost of utilities can vary depending on the type of accommodation, with apartments in urban areas tend to have higher utility costs than houses in rural areas.
