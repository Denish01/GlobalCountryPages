[SECTION] Location & Borders [/SECTION]
Brunei is a small, sovereign country located on the island of Borneo in Southeast Asia. It is situated on the northern coast of the island, bordered by the South China Sea to the north and the Malaysian state of Sarawak to the east, south, and west. The country's strategic location has made it an important center for trade and commerce in the region. Brunei's borders with Malaysia are largely defined by the Baram River to the east and the Belait River to the west.

The country's proximity to the South China Sea has also made it an important player in regional maritime trade. The sea provides a vital transportation link between Brunei and other countries in the region, including Malaysia, the Philippines, and Indonesia. Brunei's location on the northern coast of Borneo also makes it susceptible to the influences of the Asian monsoon season, which brings heavy rainfall and strong winds to the region during certain times of the year. The country's unique geography and climate have also contributed to the development of a rich and diverse ecosystem, with many unique species of plants and animals found nowhere else in the world.

[SECTION] Terrain & Landscape [/SECTION]
Brunei's terrain is characterized by a mix of rugged mountains, dense forests, and coastal plains. The country's highest point, Bukit Pagon, is located in the eastern part of the country and rises to an elevation of 1,850 meters. The mountains are covered in dense tropical rainforest, which is home to a wide variety of plant and animal species. The forests are also an important source of timber and other forest products, which are harvested sustainably to support the country's economy.

The coastal plains, which are found along the northern coast of the country, are generally flat and low-lying. These areas are home to many of Brunei's major towns and cities, including the capital, Bandar Seri Begawan. The coastal plains are also an important center for agriculture, with many farms and plantations producing a wide range of crops, including rice, fruits, and vegetables. The country's many rivers, including the Belait and Tutong rivers, also provide a source of fresh water and support a wide range of aquatic life.

The unique combination of mountains, forests, and coastal plains in Brunei has created a diverse and complex landscape, with many different ecosystems and habitats. The country's terrain and landscape have also played an important role in shaping its culture and history, with many of the country's traditional industries and practices, such as forestry and fishing, still playing an important role in the economy today.
