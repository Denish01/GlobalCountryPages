The language of instruction is Malay, but English is also widely used, especially in private and international schools. Compulsory education in Brunei lasts for 12 years, from primary to secondary level, and students can choose to attend public or private schools. International schools are also available, offering curricula such as the International Baccalaureate (IB) and the General Certificate of Education (GCE).\n\nThe quality of education in Brunei is generally high, with public schools offering a good standard of education, although some may lack resources and facilities compared to private schools.
