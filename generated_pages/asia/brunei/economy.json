The country has a relatively small population of approximately 0.45 million people, with a high GDP per capita of $31,858. Brunei's economy is heavily reliant on the export of petroleum products, which has enabled the country to achieve a high standard of living. The government has been implementing various measures to diversify the economy, including the development of the financial and manufacturing sectors.\n\nBrunei's economic development has been rapid, with the country transitioning from a poor agricultural economy to a modern, industrialized nation in a relatively short period. The discovery of oil in the 1920s marked the beginning of Brunei's economic transformation, and the country has since become one of the wealthiest nations in the world. However, the economy is still heavily reliant on oil and gas exports, which makes it vulnerable to fluctuations in global energy prices.\n\nThe government of Brunei has been actively promoting economic diversification, with a focus on developing the services sector, including finance, tourism, and education. The country has also been investing in infrastructure development, including the construction of new roads, bridges, and buildings. Despite these efforts, the economy remains heavily reliant on oil and gas exports, and the government faces challenges in achieving its goal of diversifying the economy.\n\n[SECTION] Key Industries [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Industry | Contribution | Details |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Oil and Gas | 60% of GDP | Brunei is a significant producer of oil and gas, with most of its production exported to countries such as Japan, South Korea, and China |\n| Finance | 15% of GDP | The financial sector is a growing contributor to Brunei's economy, with a number of banks and financial institutions operating in the country |\n| Manufacturing | 10% of GDP | Brunei has a small but growing manufacturing sector, with a focus on the production of food, beverages, and other consumer goods |\n| Services | 10% of GDP | The services sector, including tourism, education, and healthcare, is a growing contributor to Brunei's economy |\n| Agriculture | 5% of GDP | Agriculture is a small sector in Brunei, with a focus on the production of rice, fruits, and vegetables |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Trade Profile [/SECTION]\n**Top Exports:** \n- **Crude Oil**: Brunei's main export, accounting for the majority of its export earnings\n- **Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG)**: Brunei is a significant producer of LNG, with most of its production exported to countries in Asia\n- **Refined Petroleum Products**: Brunei also exports refined petroleum products, such as gasoline and diesel fuel\n- **Chemicals**: The country exports a range of chemicals, including fertilizers and plastics\n- **Food Products**: Brunei exports a range of food products, including rice, fruits, and vegetables\n\n**Top Imports:** \n- **Machinery and Equipment**: Brunei imports a range of machinery and equipment, including vehicles and electronics\n- **Chemicals**: The country imports chemicals, including fertilizers and plastics\n- **Food Products**: Brunei imports a range of food products, including meat, dairy products, and grains\n- **Fuel**: Despite being a significant producer of oil and gas, Brunei still imports some fuel products\n- **Construction Materials**: The country imports construction materials, including steel, cement, and timber\n\n**Key Trading Partners:** \n- Malaysia: Brunei's largest trading partner, with significant trade in oil and gas, as well as other products\n- China: A growing trading partner, with significant trade in oil and gas, as well as other products\n- Japan: A significant trading partner, with trade in oil and gas, as well as other products\n- Singapore: A significant trading partner, with trade in oil and gas, as well as other products\n- South Korea: A significant trading partner, with trade in oil and gas, as well as other products\n\n[SECTION] Infrastructure [/SECTION]\n- Brunei has a well-developed transport network, including a range of roads, bridges, and airports\n- The country has a significant energy sector, with a range of power plants and transmission lines\n- Brunei has a high level of internet and mobile penetration, with a range of telecommunications providers operating in the country\n- The country has a number of ports and airports, including the Brunei International Airport and the Muara Port\n- Brunei is investing in the development of its infrastructure, including the construction of new roads, bridges, and buildings\n\n[SECTION] Economic Outlook [/SECTION]\nBrunei's economy is expected to continue growing, driven by the ongoing development of its oil and gas sector.
