  "content": "To get around in Brunei, you can use a combination of taxis, ride-hailing apps, buses, and rental cars, as the country has a relatively well-developed transportation network despite its small size.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMain International Airport(s): Brunei International Airport, BWN\nDomestic Air Network: limited\nRail Network: none\nDrives On: left\nRoad Quality: good\nRide-Hailing Apps: Grab\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]\nBrunei International Airport is the main gateway to the country, with direct flights to major hubs in Asia, including Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, and Hong Kong. You can also enter Brunei by land through the border crossings with Malaysia, particularly at the Sungai Tujoh checkpoint in the Belait District. If you're coming from Malaysia, you can take a bus or drive to Brunei, but be sure to check the visa requirements and border regulations before your trip.\n\nThe airport is located about 3.7 miles from the capital city of Bandar Seri Begawan, and you can get to the city center by taxi or bus. There are also car rental companies available at the airport if you prefer to drive yourself. Overland entry points from Malaysia are also available, but the journey can take several hours depending on the traffic and road conditions.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nBrunei has a limited domestic air network, with only a few flights per week to the oil town of Anduki in the Belait District. The national carrier, Royal Brunei Airlines, operates these flights, which can be booked online or through a travel agent. The flights are relatively expensive, with one-way tickets costing around $100-$200. However, the flight duration is only about 30 minutes, making it a convenient option for those who need to travel to the western part of the country.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nBrunei does not have a rail network, so you won't be able to travel by train within the country. However, there are plans to build a rail link to Malaysia in the future, which would provide a convenient and efficient way to travel between the two countries.\n\n[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]\nThere are several bus companies that operate in Brunei, including PHLS and Jesselton, which offer intercity bus services to major towns and cities. The buses are relatively comfortable and affordable, with one-way tickets costing around $5-$10. The journey times can be long, however, especially to the more remote areas of the country. You can book your tickets online or at the bus terminal, and it's a good idea to plan ahead as the buses can fill up quickly, especially during peak travel seasons.\n\n[SECTION] City Transport [/SECTION]\n| Mode | Available In | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | Bandar Seri Begawan | $1-$2 | Frequent services throughout the city |\n| Taxi | Everywhere | $5-$10/km | Available at taxi ranks or by phone |\n| Ride-Hailing | Bandar Seri Begawan | $5-$10 | Grab is the most popular ride-hailing app |\n| Water Taxi | Bandar Seri Begawan | $2-$5 | Available for travel to nearby islands and villages |\n\n[SECTION] Driving [/SECTION]\n- To drive in Brunei, you'll need to have a valid driver's license from your home country or an International Driving Permit.\n- The road conditions in Brunei are generally good, with well-maintained highways and roads.\n- Fuel costs are relatively low, with gasoline prices around $0.50 per liter.\n- Car rental companies are available at the airport and in the city center, with prices starting from around $40 per day.\n- When driving in Brunei, be aware of the speed limits, which are 100 km/h on highways and 50 km/h in urban areas.\n- Be cautious of pedestrians and motorcyclists, especially at night, as they can be difficult to see.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be sure to check the visa requirements and border regulations before entering Brunei by land or air.\n- Download the Grab app to book ride-hailing services, as it's the most popular and convenient way to get around.\n- Always wear a seatbelt when driving or riding in a vehicle, as it's a legal requirement in Brunei.\n- Be respectful of local customs and traditions, especially when traveling to rural areas.\n- Don't drink and drive, as the penalties for drunk driving are severe in Brunei.\n- Be aware of the traffic rules and regulations, such as the speed limits and right-of-way rules.\n- Consider purchasing a local SIM card or portable Wi-Fi hotspot to stay connected and navigate the country.\n- Be mindful of your belongings, especially in crowded areas and tourist hotspots, to avoid petty theft and scams.",
