[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Brunei's healthcare system is primarily funded by the government, with a strong emphasis on providing universal access to healthcare services. The system is divided into public and private sectors, with the public sector being the primary provider of healthcare services. The quality of care in Brunei is considered to be excellent, with well-trained medical professionals and modern medical facilities. Urban areas, such as the capital city Bandar Seri Begawan, have better access to healthcare services compared to rural areas, where medical facilities may be limited. However, the government has made efforts to improve healthcare access in rural areas through the establishment of community health clinics and mobile health services.

The public healthcare system in Brunei is free for citizens, while foreigners and expatriates are required to pay for medical services. However, the costs are generally considered to be reasonable, and many medical procedures are subsidized by the government. The private healthcare sector in Brunei is also well-developed, with several private hospitals and clinics providing specialized medical services. Many of these private facilities cater to foreigners and expatriates, and offer a range of medical services, including specialized treatments and procedures.

Overall, Brunei's healthcare system is well-organized and provides comprehensive medical services to its citizens and visitors. The high quality of care, combined with the relatively low costs, makes Brunei an attractive destination for medical tourism. The government has also made efforts to promote health awareness and disease prevention, with a range of public health programs and initiatives aimed at reducing the incidence of chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease.
