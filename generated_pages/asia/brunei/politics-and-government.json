The country's political system is based on the **Melayu Islam Beraja** (MIB) concept, which emphasizes the importance of Malay culture, Islamic values, and the monarchy. The Sultan's powers are not limited by a constitution or a legislative body, and he has the authority to appoint and dismiss officials, as well as to make key decisions on the country's policies. The Legislative Council, which was re-established in 2004, has limited powers and is primarily advisory in nature.\n\nThe separation of powers in Brunei is not clearly defined, and the Sultan's executive powers dominate the legislative and judicial branches. The country's legal system is a mix of common law, Islamic law, and customary law, with Islamic law playing an increasingly important role in the country's jurisprudence. The **Sharia** courts have jurisdiction over matters related to Islamic law, while the common law courts handle civil and criminal cases.\n\nThe government of Brunei has a unitary structure, with a centralized administration and a lack of regional autonomy. The country is divided into four districts, each of which is administered by a district officer appointed by the Sultan. The government has a strong presence in all aspects of Brunei's society, and the Sultan's influence extends to the economy, education, and social welfare.\n\n[SECTION] Government Structure [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Branch | Institution | Head/Leader | Role |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Executive | Prime Minister's Office | Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah | Head of government, head of state |\n| Legislative | Legislative Council | Speaker of the Legislative Council | Advisory body, approves budgets and laws |\n| Judicial | Supreme Court | Chief Justice | Highest court, interprets laws and resolves disputes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Major Political Parties [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Party | Position | Leader | Seats | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| No political parties are allowed in Brunei, as the country is an absolute monarchy |  |  |  |  |\n| However, there are several organizations that play a role in the country's politics, including |  |  |  |  |\n| Brunei National Solidarity Party | Center | Mohammed Daud | 0 | Inactive |\n| Brunei People's Awareness Party | Left | Awang Haji Mohd Yusof | 0 | Inactive |\n| Brunei National Democratic Party | Center | Pengiran Haji Mohd Yusof | 0 | Inactive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Elections [/SECTION]\n- The last elections in Brunei were held in 1962, and since then, the country has not held any national elections.\n- The electoral system in Brunei is not well-defined, and the Sultan has the power to appoint members to the Legislative Council.\n- The frequency of elections is not specified, and the Sultan can call for elections at any time.\n- Voter participation is not a significant factor in Brunei's politics, as the country's political system is dominated by the Sultan and his appointed officials.\n\n[SECTION] Political Stability & Challenges [/SECTION]\n- Brunei has a high level of political stability, with the Sultan's rule being unchallenged for over five decades.\n- The country faces challenges related to its economic diversification, as it is heavily dependent on oil and gas exports.\n- Regional dynamics, particularly the South China Sea dispute, have an impact on Brunei's foreign policy and national security.\n- The country's human rights record has been criticized, particularly with regard to its treatment of minority groups and its strict **Sharia** laws.\n- Brunei's freedom indices are relatively low, with the country ranking 156th out of 180 countries in the Press Freedom Index and 152nd out of 180 countries in the Human Freedom Index.\n\n[SECTION] Foreign Relations [/SECTION]\n- Brunei is a member of several international organizations, including the United Nations, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).\n- The country has a close relationship with Malaysia, with which it shares a border and has significant economic and cultural ties.\n- Brunei has a strategic partnership with the United Kingdom, which provides the country with defense and security cooperation.\n- The country has also established diplomatic relations with China, which is one of its largest trading partners.\n- Brunei has a neutral stance on regional conflicts, but has been involved in efforts to promote regional stability and cooperation through its membership in ASEAN and other regional organizations.",
