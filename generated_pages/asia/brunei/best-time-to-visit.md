[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
Brunei has a tropical rainforest climate, with two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season, which runs from January to September, is characterized by warm and sunny weather, with average temperatures ranging from 23 to 32 degrees Celsius. This season is ideal for outdoor activities, such as hiking, birdwatching, and exploring the country's many parks and nature reserves. The wet season, which runs from October to December, is marked by heavy rainfall and potential flooding, making it less suitable for outdoor activities.

The seasons in Brunei can have a significant impact on travel, with the dry season being the best time to visit the country's many beaches, such as the popular Pantai Seri Kenangan beach, and the wet season being better suited for indoor activities, such as visiting museums and shopping centers. The country's many festivals and events, such as the **Brunei Darussalam International Trade and Tourism Exhibition**, are also usually held during the dry season, making it a great time to experience the country's rich culture and traditions.

Overall, the dry season is the best time to visit Brunei, with its warm and sunny weather making it ideal for outdoor activities and exploring the country's many attractions. However, the wet season can also be a good time to visit, with its lush green landscapes and lower prices making it a great option for budget-conscious travelers.
