        <h2>How Brunei Is Divided</h2>
        <p>Brunei is a small, sovereign state located on the island of Borneo in Southeast Asia. The country is divided into four districts, each with its own unique character and administrative functions. The districts are Belait, Brunei and Muara, Temburong, and Tutong. The capital, Bandar Seri Begawan, is located in the Brunei and Muara district and serves as the country's economic, cultural, and administrative center. The districts are further divided into mukims, which are similar to sub-districts or townships, and villages.</p>
        <p>The administrative structure of Brunei is relatively simple, with a strong emphasis on preserving the country's traditional culture and values. The government is headed by the Sultan, who serves as the head of state and head of government. The country has a relatively small population, with most people living in the urban areas of Bandar Seri Begawan and the surrounding districts. The districts are responsible for providing basic services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure to the local population.</p>

        <h2>Getting Around</h2>
        <p>Brunei has a relatively well-developed transportation system, with a range of options available for getting around the country. The capital, Bandar Seri Begawan, is served by Brunei International Airport, which offers flights to destinations in Asia and beyond. The country also has a network of buses and taxis, which provide a convenient and affordable way to get around. For those who prefer to drive, Brunei has a well-maintained road network, with car rental options available in the major towns and cities. The country is also home to a number of scenic coastal roads and rural highways, which offer a glimpse into the country's beautiful countryside and traditional way of life.</p>
        <p>Domestic flights are available between Bandar Seri Begawan and other major towns, such as Kuala Belait and Seria. The country's bus network is relatively comprehensive, with services connecting the major towns and cities. Taxis are also widely available, and can be hailed on the street or booked in advance. For those who prefer to drive, car rental options are available in the major towns and cities, and the country's road network is generally well-maintained and easy to navigate. However, driving in Brunei can be challenging, particularly for those who are not used to driving on the left-hand side of the road. [CALLOUT] It is also important to note that petrol is relatively expensive in Brunei, and driving can be a costly option for getting around.</p>
