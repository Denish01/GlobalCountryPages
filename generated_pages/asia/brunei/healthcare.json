The system is divided into public and private sectors, with the public sector being the primary provider of healthcare services. The quality of care in Brunei is considered to be excellent, with well-trained medical professionals and modern medical facilities. Urban areas, such as the capital city Bandar Seri Begawan, have better access to healthcare services compared to rural areas, where medical facilities may be limited. However, the government has made efforts to improve healthcare access in rural areas through the establishment of community health clinics and mobile health services.\n\nThe public healthcare system in Brunei is free for citizens, while foreigners and expatriates are required to pay for medical services. However, the costs are generally considered to be reasonable, and many medical procedures are subsidized by the government. The private healthcare sector in Brunei is also well-developed, with several private hospitals and clinics providing specialized medical services. Many of these private facilities cater to foreigners and expatriates, and offer a range of medical services, including specialized treatments and procedures.\n\nOverall, Brunei's healthcare system is well-organized and provides comprehensive medical services to its citizens and visitors. The high quality of care, combined with the relatively low costs, makes Brunei an attractive destination for medical tourism. The government has also made efforts to promote health awareness and disease prevention, with a range of public health programs and initiatives aimed at reducing the incidence of chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease.\n\n[SECTION] Hospitals & Clinics [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Facility | Location | Type | Specialties | English-Speaking |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak Saleha Hospital | Bandar Seri Begawan | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Yes |\n| Jerudong Park Medical Centre | Jerudong | Private | General medicine, surgery, cardiology | Yes |\n| Gleneagles JPMC | Jerudong | Private | General medicine, surgery, oncology | Yes |\n| Pantai Jerudong Specialist Centre | Jerudong | Private | General medicine, surgery, orthopedics | Yes |\n| Kuala Belait Hospital | Kuala Belait | Public | General medicine, surgery, obstetrics | Limited |\n| Suri Seri Begawan Hospital | Kuala Belait | Public | General medicine, surgery, pediatrics | Limited |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n- **Private health insurance** is recommended for foreigners and expatriates, as it provides access to private medical facilities and specialized treatments.\n- **Local insurance options** are available, including Brunei's national health insurance scheme, which provides subsidized medical services to citizens and permanent residents.\n- **Expats** are advised to purchase private health insurance that covers them for medical treatment in Brunei and other countries.\n- **Costs** of medical services in Brunei are generally considered to be reasonable, with the average cost of a doctor's consultation being around BND 50-100 (USD 35-70).\n- **Pre-existing conditions** may be covered by some insurance policies, but it is essential to check the policy details before purchasing.\n- **Group insurance plans** are available for companies and organizations, providing comprehensive medical coverage for employees and their dependents.\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacies & Medications [/SECTION]\n- **Medications** are widely available in Brunei, with many pharmacies and drugstores located throughout the country.\n- **Prescription requirements** vary depending on the type of medication, but most prescription medications require a doctor's prescription.\n- **Common brands** of medications are available, including international brands and generic alternatives.\n- **Costs** of medications in Brunei are generally considered to be reasonable, with the average cost of a prescription medication being around BND 20-50 (USD 15-35).\n- **Traditional medicines** are also available in Brunei, with many traditional medicine shops and herbal remedy stores located throughout the country.\n\n[SECTION] Vaccinations & Health Risks [/SECTION]\n- **Required vaccinations** for travel to Brunei include Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, and Typhoid fever.\n- **Recommended vaccinations** include Rabies, Japanese Encephalitis, and Influenza.\n- **Endemic diseases** in Brunei include Dengue fever, Chikungunya, and Zika virus.\n- **Water safety** is generally good in Brunei, with tap water being safe to drink in most areas.\n- **Food safety** is also generally good in Brunei, with most restaurants and food establishments following proper food handling and preparation procedures.\n- **Malaria** is not a significant risk in Brunei, but travelers to rural areas are advised to take precautions against mosquito bites.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Tourism [/SECTION]\n- **Popular procedures** for medical tourism in Brunei include cosmetic surgery, orthopedic surgery, and dental procedures.\n- **Accredited hospitals** in Brunei include the Jerudong Park Medical Centre and the Gleneagles JPMC, which are both accredited by international organizations such as the Joint Commission International.\n- **Cost savings** can be significant for medical tourists in Brunei, with costs for medical procedures being generally lower than in many Western countries.\n- **Language** is not a significant barrier for medical tourists in Brunei, as many medical professionals speak English fluently.\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Procedures [/SECTION]\n- **Emergency number** is 991, which connects to the national emergency services.\n- **Ambulance reliability** is generally good in Brunei, with ambulances being equipped with modern medical equipment and staffed by trained medical professionals.\n- **Nearest hospitals** can be found in major towns and cities, with the Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak Saleha Hospital being the main public hospital in Bandar Seri Begawan.\n- **Insurance claims** can be made through most private health insurance policies, but it is essential to check the policy details before purchasing.\n- **Medical evacuation** may be necessary in some cases, with air ambulance services being available to transport patients to other countries for medical treatment.",
