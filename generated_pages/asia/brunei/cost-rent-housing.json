The rental market conditions are relatively stable, with typical lease terms ranging from 12 to 24 months. Deposit requirements are usually one to two months' rent, and tenant rights are protected under the **Brunei Tenancy Agreement**. Compared to regional neighbors, Brunei's housing costs are relatively high due to its high standard of living and limited supply of housing. However, the country's low inflation rate of -0.4% and high GDP per capita of $89,879 make it an attractive destination for expats and locals alike.\n\nThe housing market in Brunei is also influenced by the country's **oil and gas industry**, which drives the economy and attracts a large number of expatriates. As a result, the demand for housing, particularly in the city center, is high, and prices can be steep. However, the government has implemented various initiatives to increase the supply of housing and make it more affordable for locals. For example, the **Brunei Government** has launched several **affordable housing schemes**, which provide subsidized housing options for low- and middle-income families.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $600-$1,000 | $400-$800 | compact, basic amenities |\n| 1 Bedroom | $1,000-$1,800 | $800-$1,400 | modern, fully furnished |\n| 2 Bedroom | $1,500-$2,500 | $1,200-$2,000 | spacious, family-friendly |\n| 3 Bedroom | $2,000-$3,500 | $1,600-$2,800 | luxurious, high-end amenities |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $2,500-$4,000 | prime locations, modern amenities |\n| Suburbs | $1,500-$2,500 | residential areas, family-friendly |\n| Rural | $800-$1,500 | limited amenities, natural surroundings |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Gadong**: a popular area with a range of restaurants and shops, rent range $1,000-$2,000 per month\n- **Kiarong**: a quiet and family-friendly neighborhood, rent range $800-$1,500 per month\n- **Berakas**: a modern area with easy access to the city center, rent range $1,200-$2,500 per month\n- **Sungai Akar**: a scenic area with a range of outdoor activities, rent range $1,000-$2,000 per month\n- **Mengkubau**: a residential area with a mix of old and new housing, rent range $800-$1,500 per month\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Brunei [/SECTION]\n- Research the local market and neighborhood before signing a lease to ensure you get a fair price\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent to find a suitable property\n- Negotiate the rent and terms of the lease before signing\n- Be aware of scams and always inspect the property before paying a deposit\n- Utilities such as water and electricity are usually included in the rent, but internet and TV may be extra\n- Furnished apartments are common, but unfurnished options are also available for long-term rentals\n- [CALLOUT] Be sure to check the condition of the property and take photos before moving in to avoid any disputes when moving out\n- [RATING] 4/5 for overall satisfaction with the rental process in Brunei",
