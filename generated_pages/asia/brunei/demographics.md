[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Brunei has a relatively small population, with a total area of approximately 5,765 km², resulting in a moderate population density. The population growth rate is relatively low, at 1.5%, which is attributed to a combination of factors, including a low fertility rate and a high life expectancy. The urban population accounts for approximately 78% of the total population, with the majority residing in the capital city, Bandar Seri Begawan. The population is expected to continue growing, albeit at a slow rate, due to improvements in healthcare and living standards.

The population of Brunei is also characterized by a high level of urbanization, with many residents living in modern cities and towns. The country has a relatively high standard of living, with access to quality education, healthcare, and other amenities. However, the population is also facing challenges, such as a rapidly aging population and a dependence on foreign labor. The government has implemented policies to address these issues, including initiatives to increase the birth rate and attract foreign investment.

In terms of migration patterns, Brunei has a relatively low level of migration, with most residents being native-born citizens. However, there are also a significant number of foreign workers, particularly from Malaysia and other Southeast Asian countries, who come to Brunei to work in the oil and gas industry. The government has implemented policies to manage the flow of foreign workers and to ensure that they are integrated into society.
