[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Brunei has a high level of infrastructure development, with significant investments made in recent years to improve its transportation, energy, and telecommunications systems. The country's strategic location on the island of Borneo, bordering Malaysia, has driven the need for efficient and modern infrastructure to facilitate trade and commerce. However, there is still a noticeable gap between urban and rural areas, with the capital city Bandar Seri Begawan and other major towns enjoying better infrastructure and services compared to rural areas. The government has been working to address this disparity through various development projects and initiatives.

Brunei's infrastructure development is also driven by its **Vision 2035**, a long-term plan aimed at diversifying the country's economy and reducing its dependence on oil and gas exports. The plan emphasizes the importance of investing in human capital, innovation, and infrastructure to drive economic growth and improve the quality of life for its citizens. Recent investments in infrastructure have focused on upgrading the country's transportation networks, including the construction of new roads, bridges, and airports.

The government has also been working to improve the country's energy and water infrastructure, with a focus on increasing the use of **renewable energy sources** and improving the efficiency of its water supply systems. These efforts are aimed at reducing the country's carbon footprint and ensuring a sustainable and reliable supply of energy and water for its growing population.
