Brunei has a well-developed utility infrastructure, with a reliable supply of electricity, water, and gas. The costs of utilities in Brunei are generally stable, with minimal fluctuations. However, there may be some seasonal variation in electricity costs, with higher consumption during the hot summer months. The government of Brunei also provides subsidies for certain utilities, which helps to keep costs low for residents. Additionally, the country's low inflation rate of -0.4% in 2024 helps to maintain the purchasing power of consumers.

The utility infrastructure in Brunei is managed by several government-owned and private companies, including the Brunei National Petroleum Company and the Brunei Electricity Board. These companies are responsible for generating, transmitting, and distributing electricity, as well as providing water and gas services to households and businesses. The quality of the utility infrastructure is generally high, with a reliable supply of electricity and water, and a well-maintained network of gas pipelines.
