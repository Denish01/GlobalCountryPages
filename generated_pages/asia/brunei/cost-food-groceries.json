The inflation rate in Brunei is currently at -0.4%, which means that prices are actually decreasing, making it a good time to visit or live in the country. However, the cost of living in Brunei is still relatively high, especially when it comes to food. Eating out is a popular culture in Brunei, with many restaurants and cafes serving a wide range of local and international cuisine. However, home cooking is also common, especially among locals who prefer to prepare their own meals using fresh ingredients from the market.\n\nThe eating-out culture in Brunei is influenced by the country's **Malay** heritage, with many restaurants serving traditional dishes such as **nasi lemak** and **char kway teow**. However, the country's high standard of living and its proximity to other countries in Southeast Asia have also led to the availability of a wide range of international cuisine, from **Chinese** and **Indian** to **Italian** and **Japanese**. Despite the high cost of food, many locals and expats alike enjoy dining out in Brunei, thanks to the country's vibrant food scene and the wide range of options available.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $2.50 | 3.50 BND | |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $2.00 | 2.80 BND | |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $1.50 | 2.10 BND | |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $1.20 | 1.70 BND | |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $6.00 | 8.40 BND | |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $10.00 | 14.00 BND | |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $5.00 | 7.00 BND | |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $2.00 | 2.80 BND | |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $1.50 | 2.10 BND | |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $1.20 | 1.70 BND | |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $8.00 | 11.20 BND | |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $1.00 | 1.40 BND | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $5-$10 | (typical dishes like nasi lemak and char kway teow) |\n| Casual Restaurant | $10-$20 | (one person, 2-3 courses) |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $30-$50 | (3 courses, including appetizer, main course, and dessert) |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $50-$100 | (upscale, 3-5 courses) |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $5-$7 | |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $8-$10 | |\n| Cappuccino | $3-$5 | |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $1-$2 | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nWhen it comes to grocery shopping in Brunei, there are two main options: supermarkets and local markets. Supermarkets like **Parkson** and **Hua Ho** offer a wide range of products, including fresh produce, meat, and dairy products, as well as packaged goods and household items. However, prices at supermarkets tend to be higher than at local markets. Local markets, on the other hand, offer fresh produce, meat, and seafood at lower prices, but the selection may be limited and the quality may vary.\n\nIn general, it's a good idea to buy fresh produce and meat at local markets, where prices are lower and the quality is often better. However, for packaged goods and household items, supermarkets may be a better option. Bargaining is not common in Brunei, especially at supermarkets, but it's still possible to negotiate prices at local markets, especially for bulk purchases. When shopping at local markets, it's a good idea to **haggle** politely and to be respectful of the vendors and their products.\n\n[SECTION] Local Food Tips [/SECTION]\n- The cheapest way to eat in Brunei is to try **street food**, which is available at many markets and food stalls throughout the country.\n- **Nasi lemak** and **char kway teow** are two popular local dishes that are both delicious and affordable.\n- **Fresh seafood** is widely available in Brunei, and is often served at restaurants and markets.\n- **Local fruits** like **durians** and **rambutans** are also widely available and are a great way to try new flavors.\n- Avoid buying **imported goods**, which tend to be more expensive than local products.\n- Try **local snacks** like **kuih** and **apam**, which are often sold at markets and food stalls and are a great way to experience the local culture.",
