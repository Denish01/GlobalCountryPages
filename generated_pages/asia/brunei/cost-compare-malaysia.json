  "content": "Brunei is generally more expensive than Malaysia, with a difference of around 20-30% in overall cost of living.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nBrunei GDP per Capita (PPP): 64,919\nMalaysia GDP per Capita (PPP): 32,530\nBrunei Inflation Rate: 0.3%\nMalaysia Inflation Rate: 2.5%\nOverall Winner (Cheaper): Malaysia\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Overview: Brunei vs Malaysia [/SECTION]\nBrunei and Malaysia are two neighboring countries in Southeast Asia with distinct economic profiles. Brunei is a small, oil-rich nation with a high standard of living, while Malaysia is a larger, more diversified economy with a growing middle class. The cost of living in Brunei is generally higher than in Malaysia, due to its limited land area, high demand for goods and services, and strict Islamic laws that restrict certain activities. In contrast, Malaysia offers a more affordable lifestyle, with a wider range of options for housing, food, and entertainment.\n\nThe economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. Brunei's economy is heavily reliant on oil and gas exports, which has led to a high per capita income and a strong currency. In contrast, Malaysia has a more diversified economy, with a mix of manufacturing, services, and agriculture. This diversity has helped Malaysia to maintain a relatively stable economy, despite fluctuations in global commodity prices. Overall, Malaysia is generally cheaper than Brunei, with a difference of around 20-30% in overall cost of living.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Brunei (USD) | Malaysia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 800 | 500 | 60% more |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 500 | 300 | 67% more |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 1,500 | 1,000 | 50% more |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Brunei (USD) | Malaysia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 15 | 10 | 50% more |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 300 | 200 | 50% more |\n| Beer (500ml) | 10 | 5 | 100% more |\n| Coffee | 5 | 3 | 67% more |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Brunei (USD) | Malaysia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 30 | 20 | 50% more |\n| Taxi (per km) | 1.50 | 1.00 | 50% more |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 0.50 | 0.40 | 25% more |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Brunei (USD) | Malaysia (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 100 | 80 | 25% more |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 50 | 30 | 67% more |\n| Mobile Plan | 20 | 15 | 33% more |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Brunei (USD) | Malaysia (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 1,500 | 1,000 | 33% |\n| Mid-Range | 2,500 | 1,800 | 28% |\n| Comfortable | 4,000 | 2,500 | 37% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Brunei is cheaper for:**\n- High-end shopping, with a wider range of luxury brands available\n- Certain types of accommodations, such as high-end hotels and resorts\n- Private education, with a number of international schools offering high-quality education\n- Healthcare, with a well-developed healthcare system and modern medical facilities\n- **Malaysia is cheaper for:**\n- Food, with a wide range of affordable options available, from street food to mid-range restaurants\n- Transportation, with a well-developed public transportation system and affordable taxi fares\n- Accommodation, with a wide range of options available, from budget-friendly guesthouses to mid-range apartments\n- Entertainment, with a vibrant nightlife and a wide range of cultural attractions and activities\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nFor expats, students, and retirees, Malaysia offers a more affordable lifestyle, with a wider range of options for housing, food, and entertainment.

Families may also find Brunei to be a more attractive option, with its high-quality education system and family-friendly atmosphere.
