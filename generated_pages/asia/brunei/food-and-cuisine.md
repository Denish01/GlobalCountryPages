Brunei's cuisine is shaped by its strategic location on the island of Borneo, with influences from Malay, Chinese, and Indian traditions. The country's culinary identity is characterized by the use of fresh seafood, coconut milk, and spices, which are often combined to create flavorful and aromatic dishes. The local cuisine is also influenced by the country's Islamic heritage, with a focus on halal ingredients and cooking methods. Regional variations are evident in the different districts of Brunei, with the **Temburong** district known for its traditional **Iban** cuisine and the **Tutong** district famous for its **Kelupis**, a type of glutinous rice cake.

Brunei's food culture is also defined by its rich cultural heritage, with many traditional dishes served during special occasions and festivals. The **Hari Raya** celebrations, for example, feature a variety of traditional dishes, including **Nasi Impit**, **Lontong**, and **Ketupat**, which are often served with **Rendang**, a spicy meat curry. The country's cuisine is also influenced by its colonial past, with the introduction of new ingredients and cooking techniques by European and Asian traders.

The local food scene in Brunei is vibrant and diverse, with many restaurants, food courts, and markets offering a wide range of traditional and modern dishes. The **Gadong Night Market**, for example, is a popular destination for foodies, with many stalls selling traditional snacks and dishes, including **Pisang Goreng**, **Cakoi**, and **Kuih**, a type of steamed cake.
