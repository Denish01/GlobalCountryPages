  "content": "The history of Brunei is a rich and complex narrative that spans over six centuries, from its early days as a small trading post to its current status as a sovereign and oil-rich nation.\n\n[SECTION] Historical Overview [/SECTION]\nThe earliest known history of Brunei dates back to the 7th century, when it was a small trading post on the island of Borneo. During the 14th century, Brunei became a **Muslim** state, and its strategic location on the trade routes between China and India enabled it to flourish as a major trading center. The **Sultanate of Brunei** was established in the 15th century, with the first sultan, **Sultan Muhammad Shah**, ruling from 1368 to 1402. Brunei's power and influence peaked in the 16th century, when it controlled much of Borneo and the surrounding islands.\n\nDuring the 19th century, Brunei faced significant challenges, including **colonialism** and **piracy**. The British established a **residency** in Brunei in 1906, which marked the beginning of British colonial rule.
