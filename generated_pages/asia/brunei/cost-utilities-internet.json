The costs of utilities in Brunei are generally stable, with minimal fluctuations. However, there may be some seasonal variation in electricity costs, with higher consumption during the hot summer months. The government of Brunei also provides subsidies for certain utilities, which helps to keep costs low for residents. Additionally, the country's low inflation rate of -0.4% in 2024 helps to maintain the purchasing power of consumers.\n\nThe utility infrastructure in Brunei is managed by several government-owned and private companies, including the Brunei National Petroleum Company and the Brunei Electricity Board. These companies are responsible for generating, transmitting, and distributing electricity, as well as providing water and gas services to households and businesses. The quality of the utility infrastructure is generally high, with a reliable supply of electricity and water, and a well-maintained network of gas pipelines.\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Utility Bills [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Utility | Small Apt (45 sqm) | Medium Apt (85 sqm) | Large Apt (120 sqm) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Electricity | $50 | $100 | $150 | |\n| Water | $10 | $20 | $30 | |\n| Gas / Heating | $20 | $30 | $40 | |\n| Garbage / Municipal | $10 | $15 | $20 | (included in rent) |\n| **Total** | **$90** | **$165** | **$240** | |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Internet & Phone Plans [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Speed / Allowance | Provider Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fiber Internet (basic) | $20-30 | 10-20 Mbps | TelBru, DST |\n| Fiber Internet (fast) | $40-60 | 50-100 Mbps | TelBru, DST |\n| Mobile Data (prepaid) | $10-20 | 5-10 GB | DST, Progresif |\n| Mobile Data (postpaid) | $20-50 | 10-50 GB | DST, Progresif |\n| Phone + Internet Bundle | $50-100 | varies | TelBru, DST |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Streaming & Digital Services [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Monthly Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Netflix (standard) | $10 | |\n| Spotify (premium) | $10 | |\n| Local Streaming | $5 | (if applicable) |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utility Tips [/SECTION]\n- To set up utilities in Brunei, residents typically need to provide identification and proof of address, and pay a deposit to the utility company.\n- Prepaid electricity plans are available in Brunei, but postpaid plans are more common, and may offer more flexible payment options.\n- The best internet providers in Brunei are TelBru and DST, which offer a range of plans with different speeds and allowances.\n- To save on utility bills, residents can consider using energy-efficient appliances, turning off lights and electronics when not in use, and using public transportation or carpooling to reduce fuel consumption.\n- It is also a good idea to regularly review and compare utility plans to ensure that you are getting the best deal, and to take advantage of any promotions or discounts that may be available.",
