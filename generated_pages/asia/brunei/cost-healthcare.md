[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
Brunei has a mixed healthcare system, with both public and private providers offering a range of medical services. The public healthcare system is generally of high quality and is subsidized by the government, making it more affordable for locals and foreigners alike. However, waiting times can be longer in public facilities, and the range of services may be more limited. Private healthcare providers, on the other hand, offer a wider range of services and shorter waiting times, but at a higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the preferred choice, while foreigners may opt for private healthcare due to the language barrier and familiarity with Western-style medical care. It is recommended that visitors and expats have some form of health insurance to cover unexpected medical expenses.

The healthcare system in Brunei is well-regarded, with modern medical facilities and equipment, particularly in the capital city of Bandar Seri Begawan. However, medical services can be more limited in rural areas, and some specialized treatments may require travel to neighboring countries, such as Malaysia or Singapore. For foreigners, it is essential to research and understand the local healthcare system, including the costs and availability of services, to ensure they receive the best possible care. Additionally, many private hospitals and clinics in Brunei have international accreditation and offer high-quality care, making them a popular choice among expats and medical tourists.
