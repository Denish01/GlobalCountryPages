        <h2>Economic Overview</h2>
        <p>Brunei's economy is categorized as a high-income economy, driven primarily by its rich oil and gas reserves. The country has a relatively small population of approximately 0.45 million people, with a high GDP per capita of $31,858. Brunei's economy is heavily reliant on the export of petroleum products, which has enabled the country to achieve a high standard of living. The government has been implementing various measures to diversify the economy, including the development of the financial and manufacturing sectors.</p>
        <p>Brunei's economic development has been rapid, with the country transitioning from a poor agricultural economy to a modern, industrialized nation in a relatively short period. The discovery of oil in the 1920s marked the beginning of Brunei's economic transformation, and the country has since become one of the wealthiest nations in the world. However, the economy is still heavily reliant on oil and gas exports, which makes it vulnerable to fluctuations in global energy prices.</p>
        <p>The government of Brunei has been actively promoting economic diversification, with a focus on developing the services sector, including finance, tourism, and education. The country has also been investing in infrastructure development, including the construction of new roads, bridges, and buildings. Despite these efforts, the economy remains heavily reliant on oil and gas exports, and the government faces challenges in achieving its goal of diversifying the economy.</p>
