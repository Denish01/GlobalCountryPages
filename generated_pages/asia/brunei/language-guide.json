  "content": "The official language of Brunei is Malay, also known as Brunei Malay or Standard Malay, and it is widely spoken throughout the country.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nOfficial Language(s): Malay\nWidely Spoken: English, Chinese dialects\nEnglish Proficiency: Moderate\nScript: Latin, Jawi (Arabic-based)\nLanguage Family: Austronesian\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]\nThe linguistic landscape of Brunei is dominated by Malay, which is the primary language used in government, education, and daily life. However, due to the country's cultural and economic ties with other nations, English is also widely spoken, particularly among the educated population and in the business sector. Regional dialects of Malay, such as Brunei Malay and Kedayan, are also spoken in different parts of the country. Additionally, minority languages like Chinese dialects, such as Mandarin and Hokkien, are spoken by the Chinese community in Brunei. English is understood by many Bruneians, particularly in urban areas and tourist destinations, making it relatively easy for visitors to communicate and navigate the country.\n\nThe use of English in Brunei is also influenced by the country's history as a British protectorate, which has left a lasting impact on the language and education system. As a result, many Bruneians are proficient in English, and it is commonly used in formal settings, such as government offices, schools, and businesses. However, Malay remains the dominant language, and visitors who make an effort to learn a few basic phrases in Malay are likely to be appreciated by the locals.\n\nBrunei's language policy also promotes the use of Malay as the primary language, while English is used as a secondary language. This policy aims to preserve the country's cultural heritage and promote national identity, while also recognizing the importance of English as a global language. Overall, the linguistic landscape of Brunei is characterized by a mix of Malay, English, and other languages, reflecting the country's diverse cultural and economic influences.\n\n[SECTION] Essential Phrases [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| English | Local Language | Pronunciation | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hello | Selamat datang | seh-lah-mat dah-tang | formal |\n| Hello (informal) | Halo | hah-loh | informal |\n| Thank you | Terima kasih | teh-ree-mah kah-seh | formal |\n| Please | Silakan | see-lah-kahn | formal |\n| Yes / No | Ya / Tidak | yah / tee-dahk | formal |\n| Excuse me | Maaf | mah-af | formal |\n| How much? | Berapa? | beh-rah-pah | formal |\n| Where is...? | Di mana...? | dee mah-nah | formal |\n| I don't understand | Saya tidak faham | sah-yah tee-dahk fah-hahm | formal |\n| Do you speak English? | Bolehkah Anda berbahasa Inggeris? | boh-leh-kah ahn-dah beh-rah-hah-sah ing-ge-rees | formal |\n| Help! | Tolong! | toh-lohng | formal |\n| Goodbye | Selamat jalan | seh-lah-mat jah-lahn | formal |\n| Sorry | Maaf | mah-af | formal |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Numbers & Bargaining [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Number | Local Word | Pronunciation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Satu | sah-too |\n| 2 | Dua | doo-ah |\n| 3 | Tiga | tee-gah |\n| 4 | Empat | ehm-pat |\n| 5 | Lima | lee-mah |\n| 6 | Enam | eh-nahm |\n| 7 | Tujuh | too-joo |\n| 8 | Lapan | lah-pahn |\n| 9 | Sembilan | seh-mee-lahn |\n| 10 | Sepuluh | seh-poo-loo |\n| 100 | Seratus | seh-rah-toos |\n| 1000 | Seribu | seh-ree-boo |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Communication Tips [/SECTION]\n- When interacting with Bruneians, it is customary to use formal language and titles, such as \"Mr.\" or \"Ms.\", until you are invited to use first names.\n- Direct eye contact is generally avoided, as it is considered impolite or aggressive.\n- Public displays of affection, such as hugging or kissing, are frowned upon in Bruneian culture.\n- When visiting mosques or other religious sites, dress modestly and remove your shoes before entering.\n- It is considered polite to use your right hand when giving or receiving something, as the left hand is considered unclean.\n- Learning a few basic phrases in Malay, such as \"Selamat datang\" (hello) and \"Terima kasih\" (thank you), can go a long way in showing respect for the local culture.\n- Bruneians tend to be polite and reserved, so it is best to avoid confrontational or aggressive behavior.\n- When asking for help or directions, it is best to approach someone who appears to be in a position of authority, such as a police officer or a shopkeeper.\n\n[SECTION] Translation Tools & Resources [/SECTION]\n- Google Translate is a useful app for translating Malay and other languages, and can be downloaded on your smartphone.\n- Phrasebooks and language guides are available at most bookstores and online, and can provide a more comprehensive guide to the Malay language.\n- Language learning apps, such as Duolingo, can also be a helpful resource for visitors who want to learn basic Malay phrases.\n- The Brunei Tourism Board website provides a range of information and resources for visitors, including language guides and cultural tips.\n- Local tour guides and interpreters can also be hired to provide more in-depth insights into Bruneian culture and language.",
