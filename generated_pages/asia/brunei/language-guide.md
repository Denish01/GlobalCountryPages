[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]
The linguistic landscape of Brunei is dominated by Malay, which is the primary language used in government, education, and daily life. However, due to the country's cultural and economic ties with other nations, English is also widely spoken, particularly among the educated population and in the business sector. Regional dialects of Malay, such as Brunei Malay and Kedayan, are also spoken in different parts of the country. Additionally, minority languages like Chinese dialects, such as Mandarin and Hokkien, are spoken by the Chinese community in Brunei. English is understood by many Bruneians, particularly in urban areas and tourist destinations, making it relatively easy for visitors to communicate and navigate the country.

The use of English in Brunei is also influenced by the country's history as a British protectorate, which has left a lasting impact on the language and education system. As a result, many Bruneians are proficient in English, and it is commonly used in formal settings, such as government offices, schools, and businesses. However, Malay remains the dominant language, and visitors who make an effort to learn a few basic phrases in Malay are likely to be appreciated by the locals.

Brunei's language policy also promotes the use of Malay as the primary language, while English is used as a secondary language. This policy aims to preserve the country's cultural heritage and promote national identity, while also recognizing the importance of English as a global language. Overall, the linguistic landscape of Brunei is characterized by a mix of Malay, English, and other languages, reflecting the country's diverse cultural and economic influences.
