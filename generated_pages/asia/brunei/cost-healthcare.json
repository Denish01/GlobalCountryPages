  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Brunei can vary significantly depending on whether you choose public or private services, with public healthcare generally being more affordable, but still of high quality, with a health expenditure per capita of $733.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $733\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 7.4%\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 991 or 993\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: BND\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nBrunei has a mixed healthcare system, with both public and private providers offering a range of medical services. The public healthcare system is generally of high quality and is subsidized by the government, making it more affordable for locals and foreigners alike. However, waiting times can be longer in public facilities, and the range of services may be more limited. Private healthcare providers, on the other hand, offer a wider range of services and shorter waiting times, but at a higher cost. For locals, the public healthcare system is often the preferred choice, while foreigners may opt for private healthcare due to the language barrier and familiarity with Western-style medical care. It is recommended that visitors and expats have some form of health insurance to cover unexpected medical expenses.\n\nThe healthcare system in Brunei is well-regarded, with modern medical facilities and equipment, particularly in the capital city of Bandar Seri Begawan. However, medical services can be more limited in rural areas, and some specialized treatments may require travel to neighboring countries, such as Malaysia or Singapore. For foreigners, it is essential to research and understand the local healthcare system, including the costs and availability of services, to ensure they receive the best possible care. Additionally, many private hospitals and clinics in Brunei have international accreditation and offer high-quality care, making them a popular choice among expats and medical tourists.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $10-$30 | $50-$100 | Public clinics may have longer waiting times |\n| Specialist Consultation | $20-$50 | $100-$250 | Private hospitals may have more specialized services |\n| Dental Checkup | $20-$50 | $50-$150 | Private dentists may offer more cosmetic services |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$30 | $30-$100 | Private optometrists may have more advanced equipment |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $20-$50 | Public labs may have longer turnaround times |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$200 | Public hospitals may have longer waiting times |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $100-$500 | Private hospitals may offer more luxurious amenities |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$2,000 | Private hospitals may have more advanced equipment |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $1,000-$3,000 | Private hospitals may offer more personalized care |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | Private hospitals may have more advanced imaging technology |\n| X-Ray | $20-$50 | Public hospitals may have more affordable imaging services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Public hospital visits, basic medical services |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-$300 | Private hospital visits, specialized services, dental and vision care |\n| International / Expat | $200-$500 | Global coverage, emergency evacuation, specialized services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Common medications, such as antibiotics and painkillers, can cost between $5-$20 per prescription\n- Prescription rules are generally strict, with many medications requiring a doctor's prescription\n- Pharmacies are widely available in urban areas, but may be more limited in rural areas\n- Over-the-counter medications, such as cold and flu remedies, can cost between $5-$10 per packet\n- Some medications, such as birth control and certain prescription medications, may be more difficult to find or require a special permit\n- Pharmacy hours may vary, but many are open from 9am-6pm, Monday to Friday\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it is essential to call the local emergency number, 991 or 993, for immediate assistance.
