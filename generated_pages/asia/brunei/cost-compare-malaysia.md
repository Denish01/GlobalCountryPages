[SECTION] Overview: Brunei vs Malaysia [/SECTION]
Brunei and Malaysia are two neighboring countries in Southeast Asia with distinct economic profiles. Brunei is a small, oil-rich nation with a high standard of living, while Malaysia is a larger, more diversified economy with a growing middle class. The cost of living in Brunei is generally higher than in Malaysia, due to its limited land area, high demand for goods and services, and strict Islamic laws that restrict certain activities. In contrast, Malaysia offers a more affordable lifestyle, with a wider range of options for housing, food, and entertainment.

The economic context of the two countries also plays a significant role in determining their cost of living. Brunei's economy is heavily reliant on oil and gas exports, which has led to a high per capita income and a strong currency. In contrast, Malaysia has a more diversified economy, with a mix of manufacturing, services, and agriculture. This diversity has helped Malaysia to maintain a relatively stable economy, despite fluctuations in global commodity prices. Overall, Malaysia is generally cheaper than Brunei, with a difference of around 20-30% in overall cost of living.
