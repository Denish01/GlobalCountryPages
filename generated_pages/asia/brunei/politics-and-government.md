[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The government of Brunei is characterized by a strong centralized authority, with the Sultan serving as the head of state and head of government. The country's political system is based on the **Melayu Islam Beraja** (MIB) concept, which emphasizes the importance of Malay culture, Islamic values, and the monarchy. The Sultan's powers are not limited by a constitution or a legislative body, and he has the authority to appoint and dismiss officials, as well as to make key decisions on the country's policies. The Legislative Council, which was re-established in 2004, has limited powers and is primarily advisory in nature.

The separation of powers in Brunei is not clearly defined, and the Sultan's executive powers dominate the legislative and judicial branches. The country's legal system is a mix of common law, Islamic law, and customary law, with Islamic law playing an increasingly important role in the country's jurisprudence. The **Sharia** courts have jurisdiction over matters related to Islamic law, while the common law courts handle civil and criminal cases.

The government of Brunei has a unitary structure, with a centralized administration and a lack of regional autonomy. The country is divided into four districts, each of which is administered by a district officer appointed by the Sultan. The government has a strong presence in all aspects of Brunei's society, and the Sultan's influence extends to the economy, education, and social welfare.
