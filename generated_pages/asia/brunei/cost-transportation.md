[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Brunei has a well-developed transportation network, with a range of options available for getting around the country. The main modes of transportation are taxis, buses, and private cars, with most people opting to use their own vehicles due to the relatively low cost of fuel and the convenience of having a car. The quality of public transit in Brunei is generally good, with a comprehensive network of bus routes covering most areas of the country. However, the frequency and reliability of bus services can vary depending on the route and time of day.

The majority of people in Brunei own their own cars, which are often used for both short and long journeys. This is due in part to the country's relatively low population density and the lack of a comprehensive public transportation system in some areas. However, for those who do not have access to a car, there are still a range of options available, including taxis, buses, and ride-hailing services. The government has also invested in improving the country's transportation infrastructure, including the construction of new roads and highways.

- Driving in Brunei can be challenging, especially for those who are not used to driving on the left-hand side of the road, so it's a good idea to exercise caution and follow local traffic rules.
- Parking options can be limited in some areas, so it's a good idea to plan your journey in advance and research parking options before you leave.
- Using a car rental service can be a good option for those who want to explore Brunei at their own pace, but be sure to research the company and read reviews before making a booking.
