The main modes of transportation are taxis, buses, and private cars, with most people opting to use their own vehicles due to the relatively low cost of fuel and the convenience of having a car. The quality of public transit in Brunei is generally good, with a comprehensive network of bus routes covering most areas of the country. However, the frequency and reliability of bus services can vary depending on the route and time of day.\n\nThe majority of people in Brunei own their own cars, which are often used for both short and long journeys. This is due in part to the country's relatively low population density and the lack of a comprehensive public transportation system in some areas. However, for those who do not have access to a car, there are still a range of options available, including taxis, buses, and ride-hailing services. The government has also invested in improving the country's transportation infrastructure, including the construction of new roads and highways.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $1 | $30 | Comprehensive coverage of Bandar Seri Begawan |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available in Brunei |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $2 | N/A | Limited routes, mainly used for short journeys |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available in Brunei |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $3 | $0.50 | $5-10 | Available at most taxi stands and hotels |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $2 | $0.30 | $5-10 | Grab is the most popular ride-hailing app in Brunei |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $20-30 | To city center, available at Bandar Seri Begawan International Airport |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $0.60 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $0.55 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-60 | Economy car, available at Bandar Seri Begawan International Airport |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-2 | Limited parking options available in some areas |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | $2-5 | Limited toll roads in Brunei, mainly used for long-distance journeys |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-20 | Limited routes available, mainly used for travel to Malaysia |\n| Domestic Flight | $50-100 | Limited domestic flights available, mainly used for travel to remote areas |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available in Brunei |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Using a ride-hailing app such as Grab can be a convenient and cost-effective way to get around Brunei, especially for short journeys.\n- Taxis are widely available, but it's a good idea to negotiate the fare before you start your journey to avoid any disputes.\n- If you plan to use public transportation regularly, it's a good idea to purchase a monthly transit pass, which can save you money in the long run.\n- Driving in Brunei can be challenging, especially for those who are not used to driving on the left-hand side of the road, so it's a good idea to exercise caution and follow local traffic rules.\n- Parking options can be limited in some areas, so it's a good idea to plan your journey in advance and research parking options before you leave.\n- Using a car rental service can be a good option for those who want to explore Brunei at their own pace, but be sure to research the company and read reviews before making a booking.",
