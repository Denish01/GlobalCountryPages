[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
Brunei's housing market is characterized by a mix of modern and traditional homes, with a strong demand for apartments and houses in the city center and surrounding areas. The rental market conditions are relatively stable, with typical lease terms ranging from 12 to 24 months. Deposit requirements are usually one to two months' rent, and tenant rights are protected under the **Brunei Tenancy Agreement**. Compared to regional neighbors, Brunei's housing costs are relatively high due to its high standard of living and limited supply of housing. However, the country's low inflation rate of -0.4% and high GDP per capita of $89,879 make it an attractive destination for expats and locals alike.

The housing market in Brunei is also influenced by the country's **oil and gas industry**, which drives the economy and attracts a large number of expatriates. As a result, the demand for housing, particularly in the city center, is high, and prices can be steep. However, the government has implemented various initiatives to increase the supply of housing and make it more affordable for locals. For example, the **Brunei Government** has launched several **affordable housing schemes**, which provide subsidized housing options for low- and middle-income families.
