[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
Brunei International Airport is the main gateway to the country, with direct flights to major hubs in Asia, including Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, and Hong Kong. You can also enter Brunei by land through the border crossings with Malaysia, particularly at the Sungai Tujoh checkpoint in the Belait District. If you're coming from Malaysia, you can take a bus or drive to Brunei, but be sure to check the visa requirements and border regulations before your trip.

The airport is located about 3.7 miles from the capital city of Bandar Seri Begawan, and you can get to the city center by taxi or bus. There are also car rental companies available at the airport if you prefer to drive yourself. Overland entry points from Malaysia are also available, but the journey can take several hours depending on the traffic and road conditions.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Brunei has a limited domestic air network, with only a few flights per week to the oil town of Anduki in the Belait District. The national carrier, Royal Brunei Airlines, operates these flights, which can be booked online or through a travel agent. The flights are relatively expensive, with one-way tickets costing around $100-$200. However, the flight duration is only about 30 minutes, making it a convenient option for those who need to travel to the western part of the country.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Brunei does not have a rail network, so you won't be able to travel by train within the country. However, there are plans to build a rail link to Malaysia in the future, which would provide a convenient and efficient way to travel between the two countries.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
There are several bus companies that operate in Brunei, including PHLS and Jesselton, which offer intercity bus services to major towns and cities. The buses are relatively comfortable and affordable, with one-way tickets costing around $5-$10. The journey times can be long, however, especially to the more remote areas of the country. You can book your tickets online or at the bus terminal, and it's a good idea to plan ahead as the buses can fill up quickly, especially during peak travel seasons.
