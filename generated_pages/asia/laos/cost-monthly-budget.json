The cost of living in Laos is relatively low compared to its neighboring countries, such as Thailand and Vietnam. A budget of $600 per month can go a long way in Laos, covering basic expenses such as rent, food, and transportation.

However, prices can vary depending on the location, with cities like Vientiane and Luang Prabang tend to be more expensive than smaller towns and rural areas.
