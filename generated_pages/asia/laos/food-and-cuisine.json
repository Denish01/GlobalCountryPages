The country's geographical location has led to the incorporation of influences from neighboring countries, such as Thailand, Vietnam, and China, resulting in a unique blend of flavors and dishes. Regional variations also play a significant role in Lao cuisine, with different provinces and ethnic groups having their own specialties and cooking techniques. For example, the north is known for its hearty stews and soups, while the south is famous for its spicy and sour flavors.\n\nLao cuisine is also heavily influenced by **Buddhism**, with many dishes being designed to be shared and enjoyed in a communal setting. The concept of **\"kin khao\"**, or eating rice, is central to Lao culture, with sticky rice being a staple food that accompanies most meals. The use of fresh herbs, such as **mint**, **basil**, and **lemongrass**, is also characteristic of Lao cuisine, adding fragrance and flavor to many dishes.\n\nIn addition to its unique flavor profile, Lao cuisine is also known for its emphasis on **street food** and **markets**, where visitors can sample a wide range of dishes and drinks in a lively and informal atmosphere. From spicy **Laap** to sweet **Khao Tom**, Lao cuisine has something to offer every palate, making it a must-try destination for food enthusiasts.\n\n[SECTION] Must-Try Dishes [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Dish | Type | Description | Where to Find |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Or Lam | Stew | a thick, flavorful stew made with meat or fish, chilies, and herbs | Luang Prabang night market |\n| Laap | Salad | a spicy minced meat salad made with beef, pork, or chicken, mixed with herbs, chilies, and lime juice | Vientiane restaurants |\n| Tam Maak Hoong | Salad | a spicy papaya salad made with shredded green papaya, tomatoes, chilies, and peanuts | street food stalls in Vang Vieng |\n| Khao Piak Sen | Soup | a comforting rice porridge made with chicken or pork broth, herbs, and chilies | morning markets in Luang Prabang |\n| Grilled Fish | Main Course | a whole fish grilled over charcoal, served with sticky rice and dipping sauce | restaurants in Pakse |\n| Mok Pa | Steamed Fish | a steamed fish dish made with fish, lemongrass, and chilies, wrapped in banana leaves | Luang Prabang restaurants |\n| Khao Tom | Dessert | a sweet and fragrant dessert made with sticky rice, coconut milk, and sugar | street food stalls in Vientiane |\n| Sai Oua | Sausage | a spicy Lao sausage made with pork, herbs, and chilies, grilled over charcoal | markets in Vang Vieng |\n| Khao Soi | Noodle Soup | a curried noodle soup made with boiled and fried noodles, meat or fish, and a variety of vegetables | restaurants in Luang Prabang |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Street Food & Snacks [/SECTION]\n- Khao Tom, a sweet and fragrant dessert made with sticky rice, coconut milk, and sugar, typically costing $1-2 USD\n- Grilled pork or chicken skewers, marinated in a mixture of fish sauce, lime juice, and herbs, typically costing $2-3 USD\n- Fried insects, such as crickets or mealworms, seasoned with salt and chilies, typically costing $1-2 USD\n- Fresh fruit, such as mangoes, bananas, or papayas, typically costing $0.50-1 USD\n- Coconut ice cream, a creamy and refreshing dessert made with coconut milk, sugar, and flavorings, typically costing $2-3 USD\n- Baguette sandwiches, filled with grilled meat, herbs, and chilies, typically costing $2-3 USD\n- Fried doughnuts, sprinkled with sugar and sesame seeds, typically costing $1-2 USD\n- Sticky rice, served with a variety of dipping sauces, typically costing $0.50-1 USD\n\n[SECTION] Drinks [/SECTION]\n- Beer Lao, a crisp and refreshing lager beer, typically costing $2-3 USD\n- Lao coffee, a strong and rich coffee made with coffee beans, sugar, and condensed milk, typically costing $1-2 USD\n- Fresh coconut water, a refreshing and hydrating drink, typically costing $0.50-1 USD\n- Sugar cane juice, a sweet and refreshing drink made with sugar cane, typically costing $1-2 USD\n- Lao whiskey, a strong and flavorful spirit made with rice or corn, typically costing $5-10 USD\n- Fresh fruit smoothies, made with a variety of fruits, yogurt, and honey, typically costing $2-3 USD\n\n[SECTION] Dining Customs [/SECTION]\n- Dining is a communal and social activity in Lao culture, with meals often being shared with family and friends\n- It is customary to use your right hand when eating, as the left hand is considered unclean\n- Try a little of each dish, as it is considered impolite to leave a dish unfinished\n- Wait for the host to invite you to eat before starting your meal\n- Use chopsticks or your hands to eat, as utensils are not always provided\n- Dress modestly when dining at temples or in rural areas, as Lao culture is generally conservative\n\n[SECTION] Where to Eat [/SECTION]\n- Night markets, such as the Luang Prabang night market, offering a wide range of street food and drinks\n- Restaurants, such as those in Vientiane or Luang Prabang, offering a variety of Lao and international dishes\n- Food courts, such as those in shopping malls, offering a range of affordable and convenient options\n- Street food stalls, offering a variety of snacks and drinks, such as grilled meat or fresh fruit\n- Markets, such as the Vang Vieng market, offering a range of fresh produce, meats, and handicrafts\n\n[SECTION] Food Markets & Food Experiences [/SECTION]\n- Luang Prabang night market, offering a wide range of street food, drinks, and handicrafts, located in the heart of Luang Prabang\n- Vang Vieng market, offering a range of fresh produce, meats, and handicrafts, located in the town center of Vang Vieng\n- Vientiane morning market, offering a range of fresh produce, flowers, and incense, located near the Vientiane city center\n- Pakse market, offering a range of fresh produce, meats, and handicrafts, located in the town center of Pakse\n- Kuang Si Falls picnic area, offering a scenic and relaxing spot to enjoy a meal or snack, located near the Kuang Si Falls in Luang Prabang province",
