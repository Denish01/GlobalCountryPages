The education system in Laos is structured into three main levels: **primary education**, which lasts for 5 years, **secondary education**, which is divided into lower secondary (3 years) and upper secondary (3 years), and **tertiary education**, which includes universities and other higher education institutions. The quality of education in Laos varies, with public schools often facing challenges such as limited resources and outdated curricula, while private schools and international schools tend to offer higher quality education. The government has implemented various reforms to improve the education system, including the introduction of a new curriculum and the establishment of teacher training programs.

The education system in Laos is largely public, with the majority of students attending public schools. However, in recent years, there has been an increase in the number of private schools and international schools, particularly in urban areas such as Vientiane. These schools often offer a higher quality of education and are popular among wealthy Lao families and expatriates. Despite the challenges facing the education system, Laos has made significant progress in increasing access to education, particularly for girls and children from disadvantaged backgrounds.

The Lao government has also implemented initiatives to improve the quality of education, including the introduction of **bilingual education** programs, which aim to improve students' English language skills and provide them with better job opportunities. Additionally, the government has established partnerships with international organizations and foreign governments to provide training and support for teachers and education officials.
