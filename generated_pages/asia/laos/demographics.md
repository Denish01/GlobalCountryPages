[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
Laos has a relatively small population compared to its neighboring countries, with a total of approximately 7.5 million people. The population growth rate is estimated to be around 1.5% per annum, which is relatively high compared to other countries in the region. The median age of the population is 23 years, indicating a relatively young population. Urbanization is also on the rise, with around 35% of the population living in urban areas, primarily in the capital city of Vientiane and other major cities such as Luang Prabang and Pakse. Migration patterns in Laos are also significant, with many people moving from rural areas to urban centers in search of better economic opportunities.

The population of Laos is expected to continue growing, with estimates suggesting that it will reach around 10 million by 2030. This growth will likely put pressure on the country's resources, infrastructure, and services, particularly in urban areas. However, it also presents opportunities for economic growth and development, particularly if the country can invest in education, healthcare, and other social services.

Laos has a relatively low population density, with an average of 32 people per square kilometer. This is due in part to the country's rugged terrain and limited infrastructure, which can make it difficult for people to access certain areas. However, the population density is higher in urban areas, where people are more concentrated.

Many people are moving from rural areas to cities in search of better jobs, higher incomes, and improved living standards. However, this trend also presents challenges, including the need for improved infrastructure, housing, and services in urban areas. The Lao government is working to address these challenges, through investments in urban planning, transportation, and social services.
