[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
Laos has a mixed healthcare system, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public healthcare system is generally underfunded and understaffed, with limited resources and equipment, especially in rural areas. In contrast, private healthcare providers, often catering to foreigners and affluent locals, offer higher-quality care with more modern facilities and equipment. However, these services are often expensive and may not be accessible to the general population. The quality of care in Laos is generally lower compared to other countries in the region, with a **quality rating** of 2/5. Urban areas, such as Vientiane, have better access to healthcare services, while rural areas often rely on traditional medicine and limited public health facilities.

The Lao government has made efforts to improve the healthcare system, including increasing funding and investing in new equipment and facilities. However, more needs to be done to address the significant disparities in access to healthcare, particularly in rural areas. The government has also introduced a **universal health insurance** scheme, which aims to provide coverage to all citizens, but its implementation and effectiveness are still limited.

Despite these challenges, Laos has made significant progress in improving health outcomes, including reducing **child mortality rates** and increasing **life expectancy**. However, the country still faces significant health challenges, including a high burden of **infectious diseases**, such as tuberculosis and malaria, and a growing incidence of **non-communicable diseases**, such as diabetes and heart disease.
