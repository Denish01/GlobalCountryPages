The average internet speed is around 10 Mbps, which is relatively slow compared to other countries in the region. However, the speed and reliability of the internet can vary greatly depending on the location, with urban areas such as Vientiane and Luang Prabang generally having faster and more reliable internet than rural areas. The government has been investing in the development of the country's **telecommunications infrastructure**, which has led to an increase in the number of internet users and the availability of internet services.\n\nThe urban-rural divide is still a significant issue in Laos, with many rural areas lacking access to reliable and fast internet. However, the government and mobile carriers have been working to expand their networks and improve services in these areas. Despite the challenges, the internet has become an essential tool for many people in Laos, particularly in urban areas, and is widely used for communication, education, and business. The reliability of the internet can also be affected by the weather, with heavy rain and flooding sometimes causing outages and disruptions.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nGetting a SIM card in Laos is relatively easy, with several mobile carriers offering **tourist SIMs** and prepaid plans. The main carriers in Laos are Unitel, Lao Telecom, and ETL, and they all offer a range of plans and services. To buy a SIM card, you will need to provide your passport and sometimes a copy of your visa, and the cost is around 5 USD for a tourist SIM. You can buy SIM cards at the airport, mobile carrier stores, or at many convenience stores and markets. It is recommended to buy a SIM card from one of the main carriers, as they have the best coverage and services.\n\nThe **data plans** offered by the carriers vary, but most offer a range of options, including daily, weekly, and monthly plans. The prices and data allowances also vary, but you can expect to pay around 10-20 USD per month for a plan with a decent data allowance. It is also possible to top up your SIM card with credit, which can be done at many convenience stores and markets.\n\n[TABLE]\n| Carrier | Tourist Plan | Data | Price (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Unitel | Daily Plan | 1 GB | 1 USD | Valid for 24 hours |\n| Lao Telecom | Weekly Plan | 5 GB | 10 USD | Valid for 7 days |\n| ETL | Monthly Plan | 10 GB | 20 USD | Valid for 30 days |\n| Beeline | Daily Plan | 500 MB | 0.50 USD | Valid for 24 hours |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] WiFi Availability [/SECTION]\n- Hotel WiFi quality is generally good, with most hotels and guesthouses offering free WiFi to their guests.\n- Cafe WiFi culture is also popular in Laos, with many cafes and restaurants offering free WiFi to customers.\n- Coworking spaces are becoming more common in urban areas, and they often offer high-speed WiFi and other amenities.\n- Public WiFi is available in some areas, such as airports and bus stations, but it is not always reliable or secure.\n- Many restaurants and bars also offer free WiFi to customers, making it easy to stay connected while eating or socializing.\n\n[SECTION] For Remote Workers [/SECTION]\n- Coworking spaces are a great option for remote workers, offering a productive and comfortable environment with high-speed WiFi and other amenities.\n- Reliable cafe chains such as True Coffee and Joma Cafe offer good WiFi and a comfortable working environment.\n- Backup internet options such as **mobile hotspots** and **portable WiFi routers** are available, but they can be expensive and may not always be reliable.\n- VPNs are recommended to protect your online security and access blocked websites.\n- Many hotels and guesthouses also offer coworking spaces or shared offices, which can be a good option for remote workers.\n\n[SECTION] Tips & Warnings [/SECTION]\n- Internet censorship is a significant issue in Laos, with many websites and online services blocked or restricted.\n- Some websites and online services may be blocked, including social media and news sites.\n- VPNs are recommended to protect your online security and access blocked websites.\n- Roaming alternatives such as **eSIMs** and **international SIMs** are available, but they can be expensive and may not always be compatible with your device.\n- Be careful when using public WiFi, as it may not always be secure and can put your online security at risk.\n- It is also recommended to use a **password manager** and **two-factor authentication** to protect your online accounts and data.",
