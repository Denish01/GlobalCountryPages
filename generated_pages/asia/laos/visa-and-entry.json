[/CALLOUT]\n\n[SECTION] Visa Policy Overview [/SECTION]\nLaos has a moderate visa policy, allowing citizens of certain countries to enter without a visa, while others can obtain a visa on arrival or must apply in advance. The country offers visa-free access to citizens of several countries, including those from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and a few other nations. This liberal approach aims to promote tourism and economic development in the country. Currently, citizens of around 15 countries can enter Laos without a visa, while over 150 nationalities can obtain a visa on arrival.\n\nThe Lao government has been working to simplify its visa process and encourage more visitors to the country. As a result, the visa application process has become more streamlined, and the introduction of an e-visa system has made it easier for travelers to apply for and obtain a visa. However, it is essential to note that visa requirements can change, and it is crucial to check with the official embassy or consulate of Laos for the most up-to-date information before planning a trip.\n\n[SECTION] Requirements By Nationality [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Nationality | Visa Required? | Type | Max Stay | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| US Citizens | On Arrival | Tourist | 30 days | Can be extended for an additional 60 days |\n| UK Citizens | On Arrival | Tourist | 30 days | Can be extended for an additional 60 days |\n| EU Citizens | No | Visa-Free | 15 days | For tourism and business purposes only |\n| Canadian Citizens | On Arrival | Tourist | 30 days | Can be extended for an additional 60 days |\n| Australian Citizens | On Arrival | Tourist | 30 days | Can be extended for an additional 60 days |\n| Indian Citizens | Yes | eVisa | 30 days | Must apply online in advance |\n| Chinese Citizens | No | Visa-Free | 15 days | For tourism and business purposes only |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] By Visitor Type [/SECTION]\n**Tourists:** Tourists can typically stay in Laos for up to 30 days, and their visa can be extended for an additional 60 days.
