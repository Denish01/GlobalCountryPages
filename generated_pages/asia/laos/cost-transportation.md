[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]
Laos has a relatively underdeveloped transportation system, with limited public transportation options in smaller towns and rural areas. However, the capital city Vientiane and other major cities like Luang Prabang have a range of transportation options, including buses, taxis, and ride-hailing services. Most people in Laos get around by using **songthaews**, which are red trucks that operate as shared taxis, or by hiring a **tuk-tuk**, a three-wheeled vehicle that can carry passengers and cargo.

The quality of public transit in Laos varies greatly depending on the city and region. In Vientiane, there are several bus routes that cover most areas of the city, while in smaller towns, transportation options may be limited to songthaews and taxis. Many locals also use **motorcycles** to get around, which can be rented or purchased at a relatively low cost. However, traffic in Laos can be chaotic, especially in larger cities, and safety can be a concern for both drivers and pedestrians.
