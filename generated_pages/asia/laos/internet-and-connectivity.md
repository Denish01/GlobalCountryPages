[SECTION] Internet Overview [/SECTION]
The internet in Laos is still in the process of development, but it has made significant progress in recent years. The average internet speed is around 10 Mbps, which is relatively slow compared to other countries in the region. However, the speed and reliability of the internet can vary greatly depending on the location, with urban areas such as Vientiane and Luang Prabang generally having faster and more reliable internet than rural areas. The government has been investing in the development of the country's **telecommunications infrastructure**, which has led to an increase in the number of internet users and the availability of internet services.

The urban-rural divide is still a significant issue in Laos, with many rural areas lacking access to reliable and fast internet. However, the government and mobile carriers have been working to expand their networks and improve services in these areas. Despite the challenges, the internet has become an essential tool for many people in Laos, particularly in urban areas, and is widely used for communication, education, and business. The reliability of the internet can also be affected by the weather, with heavy rain and flooding sometimes causing outages and disruptions.

[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]
Getting a SIM card in Laos is relatively easy, with several mobile carriers offering **tourist SIMs** and prepaid plans. The main carriers in Laos are Unitel, Lao Telecom, and ETL, and they all offer a range of plans and services. To buy a SIM card, you will need to provide your passport and sometimes a copy of your visa, and the cost is around 5 USD for a tourist SIM. You can buy SIM cards at the airport, mobile carrier stores, or at many convenience stores and markets. It is recommended to buy a SIM card from one of the main carriers, as they have the best coverage and services.

The **data plans** offered by the carriers vary, but most offer a range of options, including daily, weekly, and monthly plans. The prices and data allowances also vary, but you can expect to pay around 10-20 USD per month for a plan with a decent data allowance. It is also possible to top up your SIM card with credit, which can be done at many convenience stores and markets.
