        <h2>Economic Overview</h2>
        <p>Laos is a lower-middle-income economy with a GDP per capita of approximately $1,670. The country has been experiencing steady economic growth, with a GDP growth rate of around 7% per annum over the past few years. The economy is primarily driven by the agriculture, mining, and manufacturing sectors, which contribute significantly to the country's GDP. Laos has been working to diversify its economy and reduce its dependence on a few key sectors. The government has implemented various policies and reforms to attract foreign investment and promote economic development.</p>
        <p>Laos is a member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and has been actively participating in regional trade agreements, such as the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). The country has also been working to improve its business environment and attract foreign investment. Despite these efforts, Laos still faces significant development challenges, including a lack of infrastructure, limited access to education and healthcare, and a shortage of skilled labor. The country's economy is also vulnerable to external shocks, such as fluctuations in global commodity prices and changes in regional trade policies.</p>
        <p>The Lao government has set ambitious targets for economic development, including becoming a middle-income country by 2030. To achieve this goal, the government has been investing in infrastructure development, including the construction of new roads, bridges, and hydropower dams. The government has also been promoting the development of the private sector, including small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and has been working to improve the business environment and attract foreign investment.</p>
