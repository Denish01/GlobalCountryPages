  "content": "The cost of healthcare in Maldives can vary significantly depending on whether you opt for public or private services, with public healthcare generally being more affordable but with often longer wait times and varying quality of care.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nHealth Expenditure per Capita: $1,159\nOut-of-Pocket Spend: 18.1%\nHealthcare System: Mixed\nEmergency Number: 102\nInsurance Required: Recommended\nCurrency: MVR\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]\nThe healthcare system in Maldives is a mixed system, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. Public healthcare is generally more affordable, with lower costs for doctor visits and hospital stays, but the quality of care can vary and wait times can be long. Private healthcare, on the other hand, offers higher quality care and shorter wait times, but at a significantly higher cost. For locals, the healthcare system is generally accessible, with many public healthcare facilities offering free or low-cost services. For foreigners, however, private healthcare is often the preferred option, as it offers higher quality care and more comprehensive services.\n\nIn terms of insurance, it is not mandatory to have health insurance in Maldives, but it is highly recommended, especially for foreigners. Many private healthcare providers require proof of insurance before providing treatment, and having insurance can help to cover the high costs of medical care. Additionally, some employers in Maldives may offer health insurance as part of their employee benefits package, so it's worth checking with your employer to see if this is an option.\n\n[SECTION] Medical Visit Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Public (USD) | Private (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GP / Doctor Visit | $10-$20 | $50-$100 | Public hospitals may have longer wait times |\n| Specialist Consultation | $20-$50 | $100-$200 | Private hospitals may offer more specialized care |\n| Dental Checkup | $20-$50 | $50-$100 | Private dental clinics may offer more comprehensive services |\n| Eye Exam | $10-$30 | $30-$50 | Private eye clinics may offer more advanced technology |\n| Blood Test (basic panel) | $10-$20 | $20-$50 | Private labs may offer faster turnaround times |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Hospital & Procedure Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Procedure | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Emergency Room Visit | $50-$100 | Public hospitals may have longer wait times |\n| Hospital Stay (per night) | $100-$200 | Private hospitals may offer more comfortable accommodations |\n| Basic Surgery | $500-$1,000 | Private hospitals may offer more specialized surgical services |\n| Childbirth (normal delivery) | $500-$1,000 | Private hospitals may offer more comprehensive obstetric care |\n| MRI Scan | $200-$500 | Private imaging centers may offer more advanced technology |\n| X-Ray | $10-$50 | Public hospitals may offer more affordable imaging services |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Health Insurance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Coverage Type | Monthly Cost (USD) | What It Covers |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Basic Local Insurance | $20-$50 | Covers basic medical services, including doctor visits and hospital stays |\n| Comprehensive Private | $100-$200 | Covers more comprehensive medical services, including specialist consultations and surgical procedures |\n| International / Expat | $200-$500 | Covers medical services abroad, including emergency evacuations and repatriations |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Pharmacy & Medication Costs [/SECTION]\n- Common medications such as **antibiotics** and **pain relievers** can cost between $5-$20 per prescription\n- **Prescription medications** may require a doctor's note or prescription from a licensed healthcare provider\n- Pharmacies are widely available in Male and other major cities, but may be less accessible in rural areas\n- Many pharmacies offer **over-the-counter medications** without a prescription, but it's always best to consult with a doctor or pharmacist before taking any medication\n- Some pharmacies may offer **discounts or promotions** for certain medications or services\n- It's always a good idea to check the **expiration dates** and **authenticity** of any medication before purchasing\n\n[SECTION] Emergency Care [/SECTION]\nIn the event of a medical emergency, it's best to call the emergency number, 102, or seek immediate attention at the nearest hospital.
