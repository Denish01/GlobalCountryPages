[SECTION] Political System [/SECTION]
The Maldivian government is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial. The **executive branch** is headed by the president, who is directly elected by the people for a five-year term. The president has significant powers, including the ability to appoint the cabinet and judges, as well as to dissolve the legislature. The **legislative branch**, known as the People's Majlis, is a unicameral body consisting of 87 members elected by the people for a five-year term. The Majlis has the power to pass laws, approve the budget, and exercise parliamentary control over the government. The **judicial branch** is composed of the Supreme Court, the High Court, and the lower courts, and is responsible for interpreting the law and ensuring that the government acts in accordance with it.

The Maldivian system of government is based on the principles of **separation of powers**, where each branch has distinct powers and responsibilities. However, the president has significant influence over the other branches, which can sometimes lead to concerns about the balance of power. The government is also **unitary**, meaning that the central government has significant control over the provinces and local governments.

The Maldivian constitution, adopted in 2008, provides for a **presidential system** with a strong emphasis on democratic principles and human rights. The constitution also establishes the principles of **Islamic law**, which plays an important role in the country's legal system. The government has been working to strengthen the rule of law and promote democratic governance, but challenges remain, including concerns about corruption and the independence of the judiciary.
