  "content": "The cost of transportation in Maldives can vary greatly, with a monthly transit pass costing around $25 USD and taxi start rates at approximately $1.50 USD, while fuel costs around $1.20 USD per liter.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMonthly Transit Pass: ($25 USD)\nTaxi Start Rate: ($1.50 USD)\nFuel (per liter): ($1.20 USD)\nRide-Hailing Available: (Yes — Ola, PickMe)\nCurrency: MVR\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Getting Around Overview [/SECTION]\nThe main transportation modes in Maldives include taxis, buses, and ferries, with most people getting around by taxi or on foot. The quality of public transit is relatively good, with an extensive network of buses and ferries connecting the islands. However, the lack of a comprehensive public transportation system can make it challenging for visitors to navigate the country. The capital city, Male, has a well-developed transportation network, but the rest of the country relies heavily on private vehicles and taxis.\n\nThe unique geography of Maldives, with its numerous islands and atolls, poses a significant challenge to the development of a comprehensive public transportation system. As a result, most people rely on private vehicles or taxis to get around, while tourists often use ferries or speedboats to travel between islands. The government has been investing in improving the transportation infrastructure, including the development of new ferry routes and the expansion of the airport.\n\n[SECTION] Public Transportation [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport Type | Single Fare (USD) | Monthly Pass (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | $0.50 | $15 | Good coverage in Male, limited in other areas |\n| Metro / Subway | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n| Minibus / Shared Taxi | $1.00 | N/A | Limited routes, mainly in Male |\n| Commuter Train | N/A | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Taxi & Ride-Hailing [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Service | Base Fare (USD) | Per km (USD) | Typical City Ride (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Metered Taxi | $1.50 | $0.50 | $5-10 | Widely available |\n| Ride-Hailing App | $2.00 | $0.50 | $5-10 | Ola, PickMe available |\n| Airport Transfer | N/A | N/A | $10-20 | To city center, depending on traffic |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Fuel & Driving Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gasoline (per liter) | $1.20 | |\n| Diesel (per liter) | $1.10 | |\n| Car Rental (per day) | $40-60 | Economy car, limited availability |\n| Parking (per hour, city) | $1-2 | Limited parking spaces |\n| Toll Roads (typical) | N/A | Not applicable |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Intercity & Long-Distance [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Route Type | Cost Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Intercity Bus (4-5 hrs) | $10-20 | Limited routes, mainly between Male and nearby islands |\n| Domestic Flight | $100-200 | Typical route, e.g., Male to Gan |\n| Train (long-distance) | N/A | Not available |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- To save money on transportation, consider using public buses or shared taxis instead of metered taxis or ride-hailing apps.\n- Use reputable taxi services or ride-hailing apps to ensure a safe and reliable journey.\n- Negotiate the fare with the taxi driver before starting your journey, especially for longer trips.\n- Be aware of the limited availability of car rentals and parking spaces, and plan accordingly.\n- Consider purchasing a monthly transit pass for frequent travel, which can be more cost-effective than buying single tickets.\n- Use the Ola or PickMe ride-hailing apps to book taxis or shared rides, which can be more convenient than hailing a taxi on the street.",
