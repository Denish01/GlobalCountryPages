The tax authority in Maldives, the Maldives Inland Revenue Authority (MIRA), is responsible for administering and collecting taxes, as well as providing guidance and support to taxpayers. The tax system is based on a self-assessment regime, where taxpayers are required to file their tax returns and pay their taxes on a timely basis. The tax year in Maldives runs from January to December, and taxpayers are required to file their tax returns by the end of March of the following year.
