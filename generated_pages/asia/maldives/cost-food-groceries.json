  "content": "Food prices in Maldives are generally higher than the regional average due to the country's remote island location and reliance on imported goods.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMeal at Inexpensive Restaurant: ($15-$25 USD)\nMeal for 2 at Mid-Range Restaurant: ($40-$70 USD)\nMonthly Grocery Budget (1 person): ($300-$500 USD)\nLocal Beer (500ml): ($8-$12 USD)\nCurrency: MVR\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Food Costs Overview [/SECTION]\nThe cost of food in Maldives is influenced by several factors, including the high cost of transportation, limited local production, and a strong tourist industry. As a result, eating out can be expensive, with prices ranging from $15 to $25 per meal at an inexpensive restaurant. However, the country's unique **cuisine**, which combines Indian, Sri Lankan, and Middle Eastern flavors, is a major draw for tourists and locals alike. The eating-out culture is prevalent in the capital city of Male, where a wide range of restaurants and cafes cater to different tastes and budgets. In contrast, home cooking is also popular, especially in rural areas where fresh seafood and local ingredients are readily available.\n\nThe prices of food in Maldives are driven up by the high cost of imports, which account for a significant proportion of the country's food supply. However, the government has implemented initiatives to promote local agriculture and reduce reliance on imported goods. Additionally, the country's **inflation rate** of 1.4% in 2024 is relatively low, which has helped to keep food prices stable. Overall, the cost of food in Maldives is higher than in other Asian countries, but the unique cuisine and dining experiences make it a worthwhile destination for foodies and travelers.\n\n[SECTION] Grocery Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Price (USD) | Local Price | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Milk (1 liter) | $2.50-$3.50 | 40-55 MVR | Imported from India or Sri Lanka |\n| Bread (white loaf) | $1.50-$2.50 | 25-40 MVR | Local bakeries or imported |\n| Eggs (dozen) | $2.00-$3.00 | 30-45 MVR | Local farms or imported |\n| Rice (1 kg) | $1.50-$2.50 | 25-40 MVR | Imported from India or Pakistan |\n| Chicken breast (1 kg) | $6.00-$8.00 | 100-130 MVR | Imported from Brazil or Thailand |\n| Beef (1 kg) | $10.00-$15.00 | 180-250 MVR | Imported from Australia or India |\n| Apples (1 kg) | $5.00-$7.00 | 80-120 MVR | Imported from the United States or China |\n| Tomatoes (1 kg) | $2.00-$3.00 | 30-45 MVR | Local farms or imported |\n| Potatoes (1 kg) | $1.50-$2.50 | 25-40 MVR | Local farms or imported |\n| Onions (1 kg) | $1.00-$2.00 | 20-30 MVR | Local farms or imported |\n| Local cheese (1 kg) | $8.00-$12.00 | 130-200 MVR | Made from imported milk |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $1.00-$2.00 | 15-30 MVR | Local brand or imported |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Restaurant Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $5-$10 | Traditional dishes like **mas huni** and **bambukeylu** |\n| Casual Restaurant | $15-$30 | International cuisine, including Chinese, Indian, and Italian |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $40-$70 | Seafood, steak, and other Western dishes |\n| Fine Dining (2 people) | $100-$200 | Upscale restaurants with **fine wine** and **gourmet cuisine** |\n| Local Beer (draft, 500ml) | $8-$12 | **Sri Lankan beer** or **Indian beer** |\n| Imported Beer (330ml) | $10-$15 | **European beer** or **Australian beer** |\n| Cappuccino | $5-$8 | Coffee shops and cafes in Male |\n| Soft Drink (can) | $2-$4 | **Coca-Cola**, **Pepsi**, or local brands |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Supermarket vs Local Market [/SECTION]\nThe prices of groceries in Maldives can vary significantly depending on whether you shop at a **supermarket** or a **local market**.
