  "content": "To get around in Maldives, you can use a combination of domestic flights, ferries, and local transportation options such as taxis and speedboats, as the country is an archipelago with no rail network and limited road connectivity.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nMain International Airport(s): Velana International Airport (MLE)\nDomestic Air Network: limited\nRail Network: none\nDrives On: left\nRoad Quality: poor\nRide-Hailing Apps: local alternatives\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]\nThe main gateway to Maldives is **Velana International Airport (MLE)**, which is located on the island of Hulhule, near the capital city of Male. The airport receives direct flights from major hubs in Asia, Europe, and the Middle East, including Singapore, Dubai, and Istanbul. If you're traveling from other parts of the world, you may need to transit through one of these hubs to reach Maldives.\n\nIf you're planning to visit Maldives, it's essential to book your international flights in advance, especially during peak travel seasons. Additionally, consider booking a **seaplane** or **speedboat** transfer from the airport to your resort, as many resorts are located on outer atolls and require a domestic flight or boat transfer. Overland entry points are not available in Maldives, as the country is an archipelago with no land borders.\n\n[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]\nMaldives has a limited domestic air network, with **Maldivian** being the main domestic airline. The airline operates flights from Male to several outer atolls, including Gan, Kaadedhdhoo, and Hanimaadhoo. You can book domestic flights through the Maldivian website or at the airport, and approximate costs range from $100 to $200 for a one-way ticket. It's essential to book in advance, especially during peak travel seasons, as seats are limited and flights often sell out quickly.\n\n[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]\nMaldives has no rail network, making it one of the few countries in the world without a railway system. As a result, there are no train options available for getting around the country.\n\n[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]\nThere are no intercity bus companies in Maldives, as the country is an archipelago with limited road connectivity. However, some islands have local bus services, which are often **private minibuses** that operate on fixed routes. These services are not widely available, and it's often more convenient to use taxis or speedboats to get around.\n\n[SECTION] City Transport [/SECTION]\n| Mode | Available In | Cost (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City Bus | Male | $0.50 | Limited routes and frequency |\n| Taxi | Male, resorts | $5-10 | Available at airports and resorts |\n| Ride-Hailing | Male | $5-10 | Local alternatives available |\n| Speedboat | Male, resorts | $50-100 | Available for transfers to outer atolls |\n| Private Minibus | Some islands | $10-20 | Limited routes and frequency |\n\n[SECTION] Driving [/SECTION]\n- To drive in Maldives, you'll need to obtain a local **driving license**, which is available for foreign visitors with a valid international driving permit.\n- **Road conditions** are generally poor, with many roads being unpaved and narrow.\n- **Fuel costs** are relatively high, due to the country's reliance on imported fuel.\n- **Car rental** options are limited, and it's often more convenient to use taxis or speedboats to get around.\n- **Hazards** include narrow roads, poor lighting, and a lack of road signs.\n- **Parking** is often limited, especially in Male, and it's essential to follow local parking regulations to avoid fines.\n\n[SECTION] Transport Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be aware of **scams** targeting tourists, especially when booking domestic flights or speedboat transfers.\n- **Payment methods** include cash, credit cards, and mobile payments, but it's essential to have local currency (MVR) for small transactions.\n- Download **local apps**, such as the Maldivian airline app, to book domestic flights and check schedules.\n- **Safety** is a concern, especially when traveling by speedboat or seaplane, so make sure to follow all safety instructions and wear a life jacket.\n- **Respect local customs** and dress modestly when traveling to outer atolls or visiting local communities.\n- **Learn some basic Dhivehi phrases**, such as \"shukuriyaa\" (thank you), to show respect for the local culture.\n- **Check the weather forecast** before traveling, as the monsoon season can affect transportation options and schedules.\n- **Book in advance** to avoid peak season price hikes and ensure availability of transportation options.",
