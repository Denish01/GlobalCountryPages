[SECTION] Healthcare System Overview [/SECTION]
The healthcare system in Maldives is a mixed system, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. Public healthcare is generally more affordable, with lower costs for doctor visits and hospital stays, but the quality of care can vary and wait times can be long. Private healthcare, on the other hand, offers higher quality care and shorter wait times, but at a significantly higher cost. For locals, the healthcare system is generally accessible, with many public healthcare facilities offering free or low-cost services. For foreigners, however, private healthcare is often the preferred option, as it offers higher quality care and more comprehensive services.

In terms of insurance, it is not mandatory to have health insurance in Maldives, but it is highly recommended, especially for foreigners. Many private healthcare providers require proof of insurance before providing treatment, and having insurance can help to cover the high costs of medical care. Additionally, some employers in Maldives may offer health insurance as part of their employee benefits package, so it's worth checking with your employer to see if this is an option.
