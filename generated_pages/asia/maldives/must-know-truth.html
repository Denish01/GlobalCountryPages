        <h2>Historical Context</h2>
        <p>The Maldives, a sovereign island nation in the Indian Ocean, has a rich and diverse history dating back to the 3rd century BC. The <strong>Dhivehi</strong> people, the indigenous inhabitants of the Maldives, have a distinct culture and language that has been shaped by various influences, including Buddhism, Hinduism, and Islam. The Maldives was a major stopover for traders and travelers between the East and the West, with the <strong>Maldivian</strong> archipelago serving as a key hub for the trade of goods such as coconuts, fish, and cowry shells.</p>
        <p>The Maldives was first inhabited by <strong>Buddhist</strong> settlers from Sri Lanka and India, with the first recorded settlement dating back to the 3rd century BC. In the 12th century AD, Islam was introduced to the Maldives, and the country has since been a <strong>Muslim</strong> nation. The Maldives was a <strong>sultanate</strong> from the 12th century to the 20th century, with the sultan serving as the head of state and government. In 1887, the Maldives became a <strong>British protectorate</strong>, with the British government responsible for the country's defense and foreign affairs.</p>
        <p>The Maldives gained <strong>independence</strong> from British colonial rule on July 26, 1965.

The country has a <strong>mixed economy</strong>, with a strong focus on <strong>tourism</strong> and <strong>fishing</strong>.</p>
        <p>The Maldives has a long history of <strong>monarchy</strong>, with the sultan serving as the head of state and government. The country's <strong>monarchical system</strong> was abolished in 1968, when the Maldives became a republic. The Maldives has since been a <strong>stable democracy</strong>, with a strong focus on <strong>human rights</strong> and <strong>rule of law</strong>.</p>
