[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]
The linguistic landscape of Maldives is dominated by Dhivehi, which is the native language of the Maldivian people. Dhivehi is an Indo-European language that is closely related to Sinhala, which is spoken in Sri Lanka. There are several regional dialects of Dhivehi, with the most widely spoken being the Male dialect, which is used as the standard language for official purposes. English is widely spoken in the tourism industry, and many locals in the service sector, including hotel staff, dive instructors, and tour guides, have a good command of the language. However, outside of the tourism industry, English proficiency is limited, and Dhivehi is the primary language used in everyday life.

Maldives has a small but significant minority population of Indian and Sri Lankan expatriates, who speak their native languages, including Hindi, Tamil, and Sinhala. These languages are not widely spoken among the local population, but they can be heard in some parts of the capital city, Male. Despite the growing importance of English in Maldives, Dhivehi remains the dominant language, and efforts are being made to preserve and promote the language and culture of the Maldivian people.

The use of English in Maldives is largely limited to the tourism industry, where it is used as a lingua franca to communicate with visitors from around the world. Many signs, menus, and other written materials are translated into English, making it relatively easy for tourists to navigate the country. However, outside of the tourism industry, English is not as widely spoken, and visitors who make an effort to learn a few basic phrases in Dhivehi are often rewarded with warm smiles and hospitality from the locals.
