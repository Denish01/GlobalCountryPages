While the internet quality is generally good, there is still an urban-rural divide, with faster speeds and more reliable connections available in the capital city of Male and other urban areas. In rural areas, internet speeds can be slower and less reliable, but overall, the internet infrastructure is well-developed and suitable for most users. The reliability of the internet in Maldives is also good, with minimal downtime and outages, making it a good destination for remote workers and digital nomads.\n\nThe Maldivian government has invested heavily in the development of the country's internet infrastructure, with a focus on improving connectivity and increasing access to the internet for all citizens. As a result, the internet is now widely available throughout the country, with many hotels, cafes, and restaurants offering WiFi to their customers. However, the internet can be slow and unreliable during peak hours or in areas with high demand, and some websites and online services may be blocked or restricted due to **internet censorship**.\n\n[SECTION] Getting a SIM Card [/SECTION]\nGetting a SIM card in Maldives is relatively easy, with several mobile carriers offering tourist-friendly plans and prepaid SIM cards available for purchase at the airport, phone shops, and other retail outlets.

The two main carriers, Dhiraagu and Ooredoo, offer a range of prepaid plans and tourist SIM cards, with prices starting from around 10 USD for a basic plan with data and voice minutes. It is recommended to purchase a SIM card from a reputable carrier, such as Dhiraagu or Ooredoo, as they offer the best coverage and most reliable connections.\n\nThe process of buying a SIM card is relatively straightforward, and most carriers offer English-language support and assistance. You can also purchase a SIM card at the airport, which is convenient for tourists and travelers who need to stay connected as soon as they arrive in the country.
