[SECTION] Getting There [/SECTION]
The main gateway to Maldives is **Velana International Airport (MLE)**, which is located on the island of Hulhule, near the capital city of Male. The airport receives direct flights from major hubs in Asia, Europe, and the Middle East, including Singapore, Dubai, and Istanbul. If you're traveling from other parts of the world, you may need to transit through one of these hubs to reach Maldives.

If you're planning to visit Maldives, it's essential to book your international flights in advance, especially during peak travel seasons. Additionally, consider booking a **seaplane** or **speedboat** transfer from the airport to your resort, as many resorts are located on outer atolls and require a domestic flight or boat transfer. Overland entry points are not available in Maldives, as the country is an archipelago with no land borders.

[SECTION] Domestic Flights [/SECTION]
Maldives has a limited domestic air network, with **Maldivian** being the main domestic airline. The airline operates flights from Male to several outer atolls, including Gan, Kaadedhdhoo, and Hanimaadhoo. You can book domestic flights through the Maldivian website or at the airport, and approximate costs range from $100 to $200 for a one-way ticket. It's essential to book in advance, especially during peak travel seasons, as seats are limited and flights often sell out quickly.

[SECTION] Trains & Rail [/SECTION]
Maldives has no rail network, making it one of the few countries in the world without a railway system. As a result, there are no train options available for getting around the country.

[SECTION] Buses & Coaches [/SECTION]
There are no intercity bus companies in Maldives, as the country is an archipelago with limited road connectivity. However, some islands have local bus services, which are often **private minibuses** that operate on fixed routes. These services are not widely available, and it's often more convenient to use taxis or speedboats to get around.
