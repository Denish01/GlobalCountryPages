# Maldives Infrastructure — Roads, Airports, Electricity & Water

The infrastructure in Maldives is relatively well-developed, with a strong focus on tourism and modern amenities, but faces challenges in terms of limited land area, remote island geography, and climate change vulnerability.

[FACTBOX]
Electricity Access: 100% of population
Internet Penetration: 59%
Road Network: 88 km, good quality but limited connectivity between islands
Rail Network: none
Major Airports: 5
Major Ports: 2
[/FACTBOX]

[SECTION] Infrastructure Overview [/SECTION]
Maldives has made significant progress in developing its infrastructure in recent years, driven by the growing tourism industry and government investments. The country has a relatively high standard of living, with modern amenities and services available in the capital city of Male and major tourist resorts. However, there is a notable urban-rural gap, with many rural islands lacking access to basic services such as healthcare, education, and sanitation. Recent investments have focused on upgrading the country's transportation network, including the development of new airports and seaports, as well as improving the energy and water supply systems.

The Maldivian government has also launched several initiatives to promote sustainable development and reduce the country's reliance on fossil fuels. These efforts include the development of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, and the implementation of energy-efficient technologies. Despite these efforts, the country still faces significant challenges, including the impact of climate change, which poses a major threat to the country's low-lying islands and infrastructure.

The infrastructure development in Maldives is also influenced by the country's unique geography, with many small islands scattered across the Indian Ocean. This makes it challenging to develop a comprehensive and connected infrastructure network, and the country relies heavily on sea and air transportation to connect its islands. The government has implemented several projects to improve the connectivity between islands, including the development of new ferry services and the construction of causeways and bridges.
