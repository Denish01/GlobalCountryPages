  "content": "The official language of Maldives is Dhivehi, and while many locals in the tourism industry speak English, learning a few basic phrases in Dhivehi can go a long way in enhancing your travel experience.\n\n[FACTBOX]\nOfficial Language(s): Dhivehi\nWidely Spoken: English\nEnglish Proficiency: Moderate\nScript: Thaana\nLanguage Family: Indo-European\n[/FACTBOX]\n\n[SECTION] Language Overview [/SECTION]\nThe linguistic landscape of Maldives is dominated by Dhivehi, which is the native language of the Maldivian people. Dhivehi is an Indo-European language that is closely related to Sinhala, which is spoken in Sri Lanka. There are several regional dialects of Dhivehi, with the most widely spoken being the Male dialect, which is used as the standard language for official purposes. English is widely spoken in the tourism industry, and many locals in the service sector, including hotel staff, dive instructors, and tour guides, have a good command of the language. However, outside of the tourism industry, English proficiency is limited, and Dhivehi is the primary language used in everyday life.\n\nMaldives has a small but significant minority population of Indian and Sri Lankan expatriates, who speak their native languages, including Hindi, Tamil, and Sinhala. These languages are not widely spoken among the local population, but they can be heard in some parts of the capital city, Male. Despite the growing importance of English in Maldives, Dhivehi remains the dominant language, and efforts are being made to preserve and promote the language and culture of the Maldivian people.\n\nThe use of English in Maldives is largely limited to the tourism industry, where it is used as a lingua franca to communicate with visitors from around the world. Many signs, menus, and other written materials are translated into English, making it relatively easy for tourists to navigate the country. However, outside of the tourism industry, English is not as widely spoken, and visitors who make an effort to learn a few basic phrases in Dhivehi are often rewarded with warm smiles and hospitality from the locals.\n\n[SECTION] Essential Phrases [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| English | Local Language | Pronunciation | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hello | Maruhabaa | MA-roo-hah-bah | formal |\n| Hello (informal) | Assalaamu Alaikum | ah-SAH-lah-moo ah-LAY-kum | informal |\n| Thank you | Shukuriyaa | SHOO-koo-ree-yah | formal |\n| Please | Adhu Vaa | AH-thoo vah | formal |\n| Yes / No | Iiya / Naa | EE-yah / NAH | formal |\n| Excuse me | Maafu Kure | MAH-foo KOO-reh | formal |\n| How much? | Kihineh | kee-HEH-neh | formal |\n| Where is...? | Kotheh | koh-THEH | formal |\n| I don't understand | Ma Varah Loabi Nuvanee | MAH vah-rah loh-ah-BEE NOO-vah-neh | formal |\n| Do you speak English? | Ingiliisi Dhivehi Vaa | eeng-ee-LEE-see dee-VEH-hee vah | formal |\n| Help! | Adhu Dhanee | AH-thoo thah-NEE | formal |\n| Goodbye | Dhonkalo | thoh-ngah-LOH | formal |\n| Sorry | Maafu Kure | MAH-foo KOO-reh | formal |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Numbers & Bargaining [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Number | Local Word | Pronunciation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Eka | EH-kah |\n| 2 | Deka | DEH-kah |\n| 3 | Thera | THEH-rah |\n| 4 | Hathaara | hah-thah-RAH |\n| 5 | Fahe | FAH-heh |\n| 6 | Haya | HAH-yah |\n| 7 | Hatta | HAH-ttah |\n| 8 | Ashtha | AHSH-tah |\n| 9 | Navaya | NAH-vah-yah |\n| 10 | Daha | DAH-hah |\n| 100 | Ekai | EH-ky |\n| 1000 | Duvai | DOO-vy |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Communication Tips [/SECTION]\n- Be respectful of local customs and traditions, and avoid public displays of affection or immodest dress.\n- Use your right hand when eating or giving or receiving something, as the left hand is considered unclean.\n- Remove your shoes when entering a mosque or a local home, and avoid pointing your feet at someone or something.\n- Learn a few basic phrases in Dhivehi, such as \"Maruhabaa\" (hello) and \"Shukuriyaa\" (thank you), to show respect for the local culture.\n- Avoid talking about politics or sensitive topics, and be mindful of your body language and tone of voice.\n- Use a polite and formal tone when interacting with locals, especially when speaking to older people or those in positions of authority.\n- Be patient and flexible when communicating with locals, and don't be afraid to ask for help or clarification if you don't understand something.\n\n[SECTION] Translation Tools & Resources [/SECTION]\n- Download a translation app, such as Google Translate, to help you communicate with locals.\n- Carry a phrasebook or dictionary to help you learn basic phrases and words in Dhivehi.\n- Take a language course or attend a language exchange event to learn more about the Maldivian language and culture.\n- Use online resources, such as language learning websites and YouTube channels, to learn more about Dhivehi and practice your language skills.\n- Consider hiring a local guide or joining a guided tour to help you navigate the country and communicate with locals.",
