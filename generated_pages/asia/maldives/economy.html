        <h2>Economic Overview</h2>
        <p>The Maldives has a unique economy that is heavily reliant on <strong>tourism</strong>, which accounts for the majority of the country's GDP. The country's strategic location in the Indian Ocean, combined with its stunning natural beauty, has made it a popular destination for luxury travelers. As a result, the Maldives has experienced rapid economic growth in recent years, with a GDP growth rate that has consistently outpaced the global average. However, the country's economy is also vulnerable to external shocks, such as changes in global demand for tourism and fluctuations in the global economy. The Maldives is classified as an <strong>Upper-Middle Income</strong> economy, with a GDP per capita of over $8,000.</p>
        <p>The Maldives' economic development has been driven by a combination of factors, including <strong>foreign investment</strong>, <strong>government support</strong>, and <strong>infrastructure development</strong>.
