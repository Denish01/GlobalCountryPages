[SECTION] Population Overview [/SECTION]
The Maldives has a relatively small population, with a total of 515,132 people as of the latest estimates.

The Maldives has a high population density, with an average of 1,715 people per square kilometer, making it one of the most densely populated countries in the world.

The Maldives has a relatively young population, with a median age of 29 years, and a life expectancy of 77 years. The fertility rate has been declining in recent years, with an average of 2.3 children per woman, which is slightly above the replacement rate. The population is also becoming increasingly urbanized, with many young people moving to Male and other urban areas in search of better job opportunities and living standards. This trend is expected to continue, driven by the growing economy and the increasing demand for skilled labor.

The country also receives a significant number of foreign workers, primarily from India, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh, who come to work in the tourism, construction, and fishing industries.
