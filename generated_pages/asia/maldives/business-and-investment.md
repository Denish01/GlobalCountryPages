[SECTION] Business Environment [/SECTION]
The Maldivian government has been actively promoting foreign investment, particularly in the tourism and infrastructure sectors, with a range of incentives and investment promotion agencies established to facilitate foreign investment. However, the business environment can be challenging, with a high level of bureaucracy and corruption, which can increase the time and cost of doing business. The government has implemented various initiatives to improve the business climate, including the establishment of a one-stop shop for foreign investors and the introduction of new laws and regulations to facilitate business operations.

The Maldivian economy is highly dependent on the tourism sector, which accounts for the majority of the country's GDP, and as such, the government has implemented various initiatives to diversify the economy and reduce dependence on a single sector. The country has a relatively small but growing population, with a high level of literacy and a skilled workforce, which can be an attractive feature for foreign investors. However, the country's remote location and limited infrastructure can pose challenges for businesses looking to export goods or services.

The government has also established a range of initiatives to promote entrepreneurship and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), including training programs, financing options, and business incubators. However, the lack of access to finance and the high cost of doing business can be significant challenges for SMEs, and the government has been working to address these issues through the introduction of new financing options and the establishment of a credit guarantee scheme.
