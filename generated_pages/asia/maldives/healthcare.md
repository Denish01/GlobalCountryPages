[SECTION] Healthcare Overview [/SECTION]
The Maldivian healthcare system is a mixed model, with both public and private providers offering a range of services. The public healthcare system is generally considered to be of good quality, with well-equipped hospitals and clinics, especially in the capital city of Male. However, there can be significant differences in the quality of care between urban and rural areas, with rural areas often having more limited access to specialized services. The private healthcare sector is also well-developed, with several high-quality hospitals and clinics catering to tourists and expatriates.

The public healthcare system is primarily funded by the government, with some services also provided by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and private providers. The Ministry of Health is responsible for overseeing the healthcare system, including the provision of healthcare services, health promotion, and disease prevention. Despite the overall good quality of care, there are some challenges facing the healthcare system in Maldives, including a shortage of specialized healthcare professionals and limited access to certain services, such as mental health care.

The healthcare system in Maldives is also influenced by the country's unique geography, with many islands having limited access to healthcare services. To address this, the government has implemented a number of initiatives, including the use of telemedicine and the deployment of healthcare professionals to remote islands.
