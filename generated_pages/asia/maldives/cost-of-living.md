[SECTION] How Expensive Is Maldives? [/SECTION]
The Maldives is considered one of the most expensive countries to visit in the world. Located in the Indian Ocean, this island nation is famous for its luxurious resorts, pristine beaches, and crystal-clear waters. The cost of living in Maldives is high due to its remote location, limited resources, and reliance on imported goods. Compared to its neighbors, Sri Lanka and India, the Maldives is significantly more expensive. The country's economy is heavily reliant on tourism, which drives up prices for accommodations, food, and activities.

The high cost of living in Maldives is also due to the country's unique geography. The Maldives is an archipelago of 1,192 coral islands, with a total land area of approximately 300 square kilometers. This limited land area and lack of natural resources make it difficult to produce food and other essential goods, resulting in high import costs. Additionally, the Maldives has a relatively small population of around 0.52 million people, which can drive up prices due to limited competition and economies of scale.
