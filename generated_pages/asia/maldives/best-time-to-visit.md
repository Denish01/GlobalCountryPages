# Best Time to Visit Maldives — Month-by-Month Guide

The best time to visit Maldives is during the dry season, from December to April, when the weather is sunny and dry, making it ideal for outdoor activities like **snorkeling** and **diving**.

[CALLOUT] Best months to visit Maldives: December to April. Peak season: December to March. Budget season: May to November. Avoid: May to June and September to November due to the wet season and potential **cyclones**. [/CALLOUT]

[SECTION] Seasons Overview [/SECTION]
The Maldives has a tropical **monsoon** climate, with two distinct seasons: the dry season (northeast monsoon) and the wet season (southwest monsoon). The dry season, which runs from December to April, is characterized by sunny weather, low humidity, and calm seas, making it the best time to visit the Maldives. The wet season, which runs from May to November, is marked by increased rainfall, strong winds, and rough seas, making it less ideal for outdoor activities. The transition periods between the two seasons, April to May and November to December, can be unpredictable, with sudden changes in weather.

The dry season is the peak tourist season, with **hotels** and **resorts** often fully booked, especially during the winter holidays. The wet season, on the other hand, is the low season, with fewer tourists and lower prices, making it a good time for **budget travelers**. However, some **resorts** and **islands** may be closed during the wet season due to maintenance or renovation.

The Maldives is a **tropical** destination, and the weather can be hot and humid year-round. However, the dry season is generally more comfortable, with average temperatures ranging from 28 to 32 degrees Celsius (82 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit). The wet season, on the other hand, can be quite hot and humid, with average temperatures ranging from 25 to 30 degrees Celsius (77 to 86 degrees Fahrenheit).
