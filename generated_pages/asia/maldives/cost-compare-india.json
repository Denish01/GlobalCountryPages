The Maldives is a small island nation with a high-income economy, driven primarily by tourism, while India is a large and diverse country with a rapidly growing economy. The cost of living in the Maldives is significantly higher than in India, due to the country's reliance on imports and limited land area. In contrast, India has a large and competitive market, which helps to keep prices low.\n\nThe overall cost of living in the Maldives is approximately 40-50% higher than in India, making it a more expensive destination for tourists and expats. However, the Maldives offers a unique and luxurious island experience, with high-end resorts and pristine beaches. In contrast, India offers a rich cultural heritage, diverse cuisine, and vibrant cities, at a lower cost. For example, a meal at a mid-range restaurant in the Maldives can cost around $20-30 per person, while a similar meal in India can cost around $5-10 per person.\n\n[SECTION] Rent & Housing Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Maldives (USD) | India (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1BR Apartment (City Center) | 800 | 200 | 75% more expensive |\n| 1BR Apartment (Outside) | 500 | 150 | 70% more expensive |\n| 3BR Apartment (City Center) | 1,500 | 400 | 73% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Maldives (USD) | India (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meal at Restaurant | 20 | 5 | 75% more expensive |\n| Groceries (monthly) | 300 | 150 | 50% more expensive |\n| Beer (500ml) | 10 | 2 | 80% more expensive |\n| Coffee | 5 | 1 | 80% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Maldives (USD) | India (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Monthly Transit Pass | 50 | 10 | 80% more expensive |\n| Taxi (per km) | 2 | 0.50 | 75% more expensive |\n| Fuel (per liter) | 1.50 | 1.00 | 33% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Utilities & Internet Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Item | Maldives (USD) | India (USD) | Difference |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Utilities (85 sqm apt) | 150 | 50 | 66% more expensive |\n| Internet (60 Mbps) | 50 | 20 | 60% more expensive |\n| Mobile Plan | 20 | 10 | 50% more expensive |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Comparison [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Budget Tier | Maldives (USD) | India (USD) | Savings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Budget | 1,500 | 800 | 47% |\n| Mid-Range | 2,500 | 1,200 | 52% |\n| Comfortable | 4,000 | 2,000 | 50% |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Where Each Country Wins [/SECTION]\n- **Maldives is cheaper for:**\n- Luxury resorts and high-end tourism\n- Pristine beaches and unique island experiences\n- High-end dining and entertainment options\n- **India is cheaper for:**\n- Accommodation and rent\n- Food and groceries\n- Transportation and fuel\n- Cultural experiences and historical sites\n\n[SECTION] Bottom Line [/SECTION]\nThe Maldives and India offer different value propositions for different lifestyles.
