[SECTION] Housing Market Overview [/SECTION]
The rental market in Maldives is relatively small and competitive, with a high demand for apartments in the city center of Male. Typical lease terms are for one to two years, with a deposit requirement of one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected under the **Maldivian Rent Act**, which regulates rent increases and eviction procedures. Compared to regional neighbors such as Sri Lanka and India, the housing costs in Maldives are relatively high due to the country's unique geography and limited land availability. The **tourism industry** plays a significant role in driving up housing prices, particularly in the city center, where many resorts and hotels are located.

The Maldivian government has implemented various initiatives to increase the supply of affordable housing, including the development of new residential areas and the introduction of **rent control measures**. However, the demand for housing remains high, particularly among **expatriates** and **young professionals**. As a result, renters can expect to pay a premium for apartments in desirable locations, with prices decreasing as you move further away from the city center. The **inflation rate** of 1.4% in 2024 has also had an impact on housing prices, with many landlords increasing rents to keep pace with rising costs.
