[/SECTION]\nThe Maldives is considered one of the most expensive countries to visit in the world. Located in the Indian Ocean, this island nation is famous for its luxurious resorts, pristine beaches, and crystal-clear waters. The cost of living in Maldives is high due to its remote location, limited resources, and reliance on imported goods. Compared to its neighbors, Sri Lanka and India, the Maldives is significantly more expensive. The country's economy is heavily reliant on tourism, which drives up prices for accommodations, food, and activities.\n\nThe high cost of living in Maldives is also due to the country's unique geography. The Maldives is an archipelago of 1,192 coral islands, with a total land area of approximately 300 square kilometers. This limited land area and lack of natural resources make it difficult to produce food and other essential goods, resulting in high import costs. Additionally, the Maldives has a relatively small population of around 0.52 million people, which can drive up prices due to limited competition and economies of scale.\n\n[SECTION] Accommodation Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Type | Price Range (USD/night) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Hostel/Budget | $50-100 | Basic rooms with shared facilities, limited availability |\n| Mid-Range Hotel | $200-400 | Comfortable rooms with private facilities, breakfast included |\n| Luxury/Resort | $500-1,500 | High-end resorts with private villas, fine dining, and water sports |\n| Apartment Rent (monthly) | $800-2,000 | City center apartments with 1-2 bedrooms, furnished |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Food & Dining Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Meal Type | Price Range (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Street Food / Local Eatery | $5-10 |\n| Casual Restaurant | $15-30 |\n| Mid-Range Restaurant (2 people) | $40-60 |\n| Fine Dining | $100-200 |\n| Beer (local) | $5-10 |\n| Coffee | $3-5 |\n| Water (1.5L bottle) | $2-3 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Transport Costs [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Transport | Cost (USD) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Local bus/metro ride | $1-2 |\n| Taxi (per km) | $2-5 |\n| Domestic flight | $100-200 |\n| Fuel (per liter) | $1-2 |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Monthly Budget Breakdown [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Category | Budget ($) | Mid-Range ($) | Comfortable ($) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rent | 800 | 1,200 | 2,000 |\n| Food | 300 | 600 | 1,000 |\n| Transport | 100 | 200 | 300 |\n| Utilities | 100 | 200 | 300 |\n| Entertainment | 200 | 400 | 600 |\n| **Total** | **1,500** | **2,600** | **4,200** |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Money-Saving Tips [/SECTION]\n- Consider visiting during the off-season (April to May and September to November) to get lower rates on accommodations and packages.\n- Look for all-inclusive resorts that offer meals, drinks, and activities to help budget and save money.\n- Book accommodations and flights well in advance to get the best prices.\n- Use local transportation, such as buses and ferries, instead of taxis to save money.\n- Eat at local eateries and street food stalls to experience authentic Maldivian cuisine at a lower cost.\n- Avoid drinking bottled water and instead use water filters or purification tablets to reduce plastic waste and save money.",
