[SECTION] How Maldives Is Divided [/SECTION]
The Maldives is an archipelago divided into 7 provinces and 21 atolls, with each atoll further divided into islands. The country has a unique administrative structure, with the provinces serving as the primary administrative divisions. The provinces are: Mathi-Uthuru, Uthuru, Medhu-Uthuru, Medhu, Medhu-Dhekunu, Dhekunu, and Dhekunu-Uthuru. Each province is responsible for the administration of its respective atolls and islands.

The administrative divisions of the Maldives are designed to facilitate the governance of the country's dispersed population and to provide services to the islands. The atolls, which are the secondary administrative divisions, are grouped into provinces based on their geographical location. The provinces are further divided into islands, each with its own unique character and identity. The capital city, Male, is the hub of the country's administrative and economic activities.
