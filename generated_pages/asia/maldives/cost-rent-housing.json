Typical lease terms are for one to two years, with a deposit requirement of one to two months' rent. Tenant rights are protected under the **Maldivian Rent Act**, which regulates rent increases and eviction procedures. Compared to regional neighbors such as Sri Lanka and India, the housing costs in Maldives are relatively high due to the country's unique geography and limited land availability. The **tourism industry** plays a significant role in driving up housing prices, particularly in the city center, where many resorts and hotels are located.\n\nThe Maldivian government has implemented various initiatives to increase the supply of affordable housing, including the development of new residential areas and the introduction of **rent control measures**. However, the demand for housing remains high, particularly among **expatriates** and **young professionals**. As a result, renters can expect to pay a premium for apartments in desirable locations, with prices decreasing as you move further away from the city center. The **inflation rate** of 1.4% in 2024 has also had an impact on housing prices, with many landlords increasing rents to keep pace with rising costs.\n\n[SECTION] Apartment Rental Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Apartment Type | City Center (USD/month) | Outside Center (USD/month) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Studio / Bedsitter | $600-$1,000 | $400-$800 | compact, basic amenities |\n| 1 Bedroom | $800-$1,400 | $600-$1,200 | modern, fully furnished |\n| 2 Bedroom | $1,200-$2,000 | $900-$1,800 | spacious, family-friendly |\n| 3 Bedroom | $1,800-$3,000 | $1,400-$2,500 | luxurious, high-end finishes |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Property Purchase Prices [/SECTION]\n[TABLE]\n| Area Type | Price per sqm (USD) | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| City Center | $3,000-$5,000 | prime locations, sea views |\n| Suburbs | $2,000-$3,500 | residential areas, amenities nearby |\n| Rural | $1,000-$2,000 | limited amenities, peaceful surroundings |\n[/TABLE]\n\n[SECTION] Best Neighborhoods for Expats [/SECTION]\n- **Male'**: the capital city, with a range of apartments and amenities, rent range $800-$2,000 per month\n- **Hulhumale**: a newer residential area, with modern apartments and a more laid-back atmosphere, rent range $600-$1,800 per month\n- **Villingili**: a peaceful island with a mix of old and new homes, rent range $500-$1,500 per month\n- **Thulusdhoo**: a popular surf spot, with a range of apartments and guesthouses, rent range $400-$1,200 per month\n- **Guraidhoo**: a charming island with a strong sense of community, rent range $300-$1,000 per month\n\n[SECTION] Renter Tips for Maldives [/SECTION]\n- Research neighborhoods thoroughly to find the best fit for your budget and lifestyle\n- Work with a reputable real estate agent to find apartments and negotiate prices\n- Be prepared to pay a deposit and sign a lease agreement\n- Check the condition of the apartment and any appliances before moving in\n- Consider renting a **furnished apartment** to avoid the hassle of buying furniture\n- Be aware of **scams** targeting renters, such as fake listings or excessive fees\n- [CALLOUT] Always inspect the property before signing a lease and keep a record of the condition to avoid disputes when moving out\n- [RATING] 4/5 for overall renter experience, with some challenges in finding affordable and high-quality housing options.",
